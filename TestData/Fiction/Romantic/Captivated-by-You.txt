1
ICY NEEDLES OF water
bombarded my overheated
skin, the sting chasing away
the clinging shadows of a
nightmare I couldn’t fully
remember.
Closing my eyes, I stepped
deeper into the spray, willing
the lingering fear and nausea
to circle the drain at my feet.
A shiver racked me, and my
thoughts shifted to my wife.
My angel who slept
peacefully in the apartment
next door. I wanted her
urgently, wanted to lose
myself in her, and hated that I
couldn’t. Couldn’t hold her
close. Couldn’t pull her lush
body under mine and sink
into it, letting her touch chase
the memories away.
“Fuck.” I placed my palms
flat against the cool tile and
absorbed the chill of the
punishing deluge into my
bones. I was a selfish asshole.
If I’d been a better man, I
would’ve walked away from
Eva Cross the moment I saw
her.
Instead, I’d made her my
wife. And I wanted the news
of our marriage broadcast via
every medium known to man,
rather than hidden away as a
secret between less than a
handful of people. Worse,
since I had no intention of
letting her go, I would have to
find a way to make up for the
fact that I was such a fucking
mess we couldn’t even sleep
in the same room together.
I lathered, quickly washing
away the sticky sweat I’d
woken up in. Within minutes
I was heading out to the
bedroom, where I pulled on a
pair of sweats before heading
to my home office. It was just
barely seven in the morning.
I’d left the apartment Eva
shared with her best friend,
Cary Taylor, only a couple of
hours earlier, wanting to give
her time to catch a few hours
of sleep before she headed
into work. We had been at
each other all night, both of
us too needy and greedy. But
there’d been something else,
too. An urgency on Eva’s part
that gnawed at me and left me
uneasy.
Something was bothering
my wife.
My gaze drifted to the
window and its view of
Manhattan beyond it, then
settled on the empty wall
where photos of her and us
hung in the same space in my
penthouse office in our home
on Fifth Avenue. I could
imagine the collage clearly,
having spent countless hours
studying it over the last few
months. Looking out at the
city had once been the way I
encapsulated my world. Now,
I accomplished that by
looking at Eva.
I sat at my desk and woke
my computer with a shake of
the mouse, taking a deep slow
breath as my wife’s face
filled my monitor. She wore
no makeup in the photo that
was my desktop wallpaper,
and a smattering of light
freckles on her nose made her
appear younger than her
twenty-four years. My gaze
slid over her features—the
curve of her brows, the
brightness of her gray eyes,
the fullness of her lips. In the
moments when I let myself
think of it, I could almost feel
those lips against my skin.
Her kisses were benedictions,
promises from my angel that
made my life worth living.
With a determined
exhalation, I picked up the
phone and speed-dialed Raúl
Huerta. Despite the earliness
of the hour, he answered
swiftly and alertly.
“Mrs. Cross and Cary
Taylor are heading to San
Diego today,” I said, my hand
curling into a fist at the
thought. I didn’t have to say
more.
“Got it.”
“I want a recent photo of
Anne Lucas and a detailed
rundown of where she was
last night on my desk by
noon.”
“At the latest,” he
affirmed.
I hung up and stared at
Eva’s captivatingly beautiful
face. I’d caught her in a
happy, unguarded moment, a
state of being I was
determined to keep her in for
the rest of her life. But last
night she’d been distressed by
a possible run-in with a
woman I’d once used. It had
been a while since I’d crossed
paths with Anne, but if she
was responsible for
aggravating my wife, she’d
be seeing me again. Soon.
Opening my inbox, I
started sifting through my emails,
drafting quick answers
when required and working
my way toward the subject
line that had caught my eye
the moment my e-mail
opened.
I felt Eva before I saw her.
I lifted my head and my
keystrokes slowed. A sudden
rush of desire soothed the
agitation I felt whenever I
wasn’t with her.
I leaned back to better
appreciate the view. “You’re
up early, angel.”
Eva stood in the doorway
with her keys in hand, her
blond hair in a sexy tangle
around her shoulders, her
cheeks and lips flushed from
sleep, her curvy body clad in
a tank top and shorts. She was
braless, her lush tits swelling
softly beneath the ribbed
cotton. Petite and built to take
a man to his knees, she often
pointed out how different she
was from the women I’d been
photographed with before
her.
“I woke up missing you,”
she replied, with the throaty
voice that never failed to
make me hard. “How long
have you been up?”
“Not long.” I pushed the
keyboard drawer in to make
room for her on my desk.
She padded over on bare
feet, effortlessly seducing me.
The moment I first saw her
I’d known she would wreck
me. The promise was there in
her eyes and the way she
moved. Everywhere she went,
men stared at her. Coveted
her. Just like I did.
I caught her by the waist
when she came close enough,
choosing to pull her onto my
lap instead. Bending my
head, I caught her nipple in
my mouth, drawing on her
with long, deep sucks. I heard
her gasp, felt her body jolt at
the sensation, and smiled
inwardly. I could do whatever
I wanted to her. She’d given
me that right. It was the
greatest gift I had ever been
given.
“Gideon.” Her hands went
to my hair, sifting through it.
I felt infinitely better
already.
Lifting my head, I kissed
her, tasting the cinnamon of
her toothpaste and the
underlying flavor that was
uniquely her. “Hmm?”
She touched my face, her
gaze searching. “Did you
have another nightmare?”
I exhaled in a rush. She’d
always been able to see right
through me. I wasn’t sure I
would ever get used to it.
I stroked the pad of my
thumb over the damp cotton
clinging to her nipple. “I’d
rather talk about the wet
dreams you’re inspiring right
now.”
“What was it about?”
My lips thinned at her
persistence. “I don’t
remember.”
“Gideon—”
“Drop it, angel.”
Eva stiffened. “I just want
to help you.”
“You know how to do
that.”
She snorted. “Sex fiend.”
I cuddled her closer. I
couldn’t find the words to tell
her how she felt in my arms,
so I nuzzled her neck,
breathing in the well-loved
scent of her skin.
“Ace.”
Something in the tone of
her voice set me on edge. I
pulled back slowly, my gaze
gliding over her face. “Talk
to me.”
“About San Diego …” Her
eyes dropped and she caught
her lower lip between her
teeth.
I stilled, waiting to see
where the conversation would
go.
“Six-Ninths is going to be
there,” she said finally.
She hadn’t tried to hide
what I’d already known,
which was a relief. But a
different kind of tension
flooded me instead.
“You’re telling me that’s a
problem.” My voice remained
steady, but I was anything but
calm.
“No, it’s not a problem,”
she said softly. But her
fingers were tangling
restlessly in my hair.
“Don’t lie to me.”
“I’m not.” She took a deep
breath and then held my gaze.
“Something’s not right. I’m
confused.”
“About what, exactly?”
“Don’t be like that,” she
said quietly. “Don’t get all
icy and freeze me out.”
“You’ll have to forgive me.
Listening to my wife tell me
she’s confused over another
man doesn’t put me in a good
mood.”
She squirmed out of my lap
and I let her, so I could watch
her—gauge her—with some
distance between us. “I don’t
know how to explain it.”
I deliberately ignored the
cold knot in my gut. “Try.”
“It’s just—” Looking
down, she chewed on her
lower lip. “There’s something
… not finished.”
My chest grew tight and
hot. “Does he turn you on,
Eva?”
She stiffened. “It’s not like
that.”
“Is it the voice? The
tattoos? His magic dick?”
“Stop it. It’s not easy
talking about this. Don’t
make it harder.”
“It’s damned hard for me,
too,” I snapped, pushing to
my feet.
I raked her from head to
toe, wanting to fuck her and
punish her at the same time. I
wanted to tie her up, lock her
up, safe from anyone who
could threaten my grip on
her. “He treated you like shit,
Eva. Did seeing the ‘Golden’
video make you forget that?
Is there something you need
that I’m not giving you?”
“Don’t be an ass.” Her
arms crossed, a defensive
pose that angered me further.
I needed her open and soft.
I needed her completely. And
there were times when I was
maddened by how much she
meant to me. She was the one
thing I couldn’t imagine
losing. And she was saying
the one thing I couldn’t bear
hearing.
“Please don’t be ugly about
this,” she whispered.
“I’m being remarkably
civilized, considering how
violent I feel at the moment.”
“Gideon.” Guilt darkened
her gray eyes, and then tears
glistened.
I looked away. “Don’t!”
But she saw into me the
way she always did.
“I didn’t mean to hurt
you.” The diamond on her
ring finger—my claim to her
—caught the light and shot
sparks of multihued fire
against the wall. “I hate that
you’re upset and pissed off at
me. It hurts me, too, Gideon.
I don’t want him. I swear I
don’t.”
Restless, I went to the
window, trying to find the
calm I needed to deal with the
danger Brett Kline presented.
I’d done everything I could. I
had said the vows, slid the
ring on her finger. Bound her
to me in every way. Yet it
still wasn’t enough.
The city spread out before
me, the view obstructed by
taller buildings. From the
penthouse, I could see for
miles. But from the Upper
West Side apartment I’d
taken next door to Eva’s, the
vista was limited. I couldn’t
see the endless ribbons of
streets clogged with yellow
taxis or sunlight glinting off
the many skyscraper
windows.
I could give Eva New
York. I could give her the
world. I couldn’t love her
more than I did; it consumed
me. And still, an asshole from
her past was making strides
on edging me out.
I remembered her in
Kline’s arms, kissing him
with a desperation she should
feel only for me. The
possibility that lust for him
might still affect her made me
want to tear something apart.
My knuckles popped as my
hands fisted. “Do we need to
take a break already? Take
some time for Kline to clear
up your confusion? Maybe I
should do the same and help
Corinne deal with hers.”
She sucked in a shaky
breath at the mention of my
former fiancée. “Are you
serious?”
There was a terrible stretch
of silence.
Then, “Congratulations,
dickhead. You just hurt me
worse than he ever did.”
I turned in time to see her
stalking out of the room, her
back rigid and tense. The
keys she’d used to let herself
in were left on my desk, and
the sight of them abandoned
triggered something
desperate. “Stop.”
I caught her and she
struggled, the dynamic
between us so familiar—Eva
running, me chasing.
“Let me go!”
My eyes closed and I
pressed my face against her.
“I won’t let him have you.”
“I’m so mad at you right
now, I could hit you.”
I wanted her to. Wanted
the pain. “Do it.”
She clawed at my
forearms. “Put me down,
Gideon.”
I turned her around and
pinned her to the hallway
wall. “What am I supposed to
do when you tell me you’re
confused about Brett Kline? I
feel like I’m hanging on the
edge of a cliff and my grip is
slipping.”
“So you’re going to tear at
me to hold on? Why don’t
you get that I’m not going
anywhere?”
I stared down at her,
scrambling for something to
say that would make things
right between us. Her lower
lip began to quiver and I … I
unraveled.
“Tell me how to handle
this,” I said hoarsely, circling
her wrists and exerting gentle
pressure. “Tell me what to
do.”
“Handle me, you mean?”
Her shoulders went back.
“Because I’m what’s wrong
here. I knew Brett during a
time in my life when I hated
myself but wanted other
people to love me. And now
he’s acting the way I wanted
him to back then and it’s
giving me a head trip.”
“Christ, Eva.” I pressed
harder, flattening my body
against her. “How am I not
supposed to feel threatened
by that?”
“You’re supposed to trust
me. I told you because I
didn’t want you to get weird
vibes and jump to
conclusions. I wanted to be
honest about it so you
wouldn’t feel threatened. I
know I’ve got some stuff to
work out in my head. I’m
going to see Dr. Travis this
weekend and—”
“Shrinks aren’t a cure-all!”
“Don’t yell at me.”
I fought the urge to slam
my fist into the plaster behind
her. My wife’s blind faith in
the healing properties of
therapy frustrated the hell out
of me. “We’re not running to
a damned doctor every time
we’ve got a problem. It’s you
and me in this marriage. Not
the goddamned psychiatric
community!”
Her chin lifted, her jaw
taking on the determined
slant that drove me crazy. She
never gave me an inch unless
my cock was inside her. Then
she gave me everything.
“You may think you don’t
need help, ace, but I know I
do.”
“What I need is you.” I
cupped her head in my heads.
“I need my wife. And I need
her thinking about me and not
some other guy!”
“You’re making me wish I
hadn’t said anything.”
My lip curled in a sneer. “I
knew how you felt. I’ve seen
it.”
“God. You jealous, crazy
…” She moaned softly. “Why
don’t you understand how
much I love you? Brett’s got
nothing on you. Nothing. But
honestly, I don’t want to be
around you right now.”
I felt her resistance, the
pushback of her trying to get
away. I clutched her like a
lifeline. “Can’t you see what
you’re doing to me?”
Eva softened in my arms.
“I don’t get you, Gideon.
How can you just flip a
switch and turn your feelings
off? Knowing how I feel
about Corinne, how could
you throw her in my face like
that?”
“You’re the reason I
breathe, I can’t turn it off.” I
slid my mouth across her
cheek. “I think of nothing but
you. All day. Every day.
Everything I do, I do with
you in mind. There’s no room
for anyone else. It kills me
that you have room for him.”
“You’re not listening.”
“Just stay the hell away
from him.”
“That’s avoidance, not a
solution.” Her fingers dug
into my waist. “I’m broken,
Gideon, you know that. I’m
piecing myself back
together.”
I loved her just the way she
was. Why wasn’t that
enough?
“Thanks to you I’m
stronger than I’ve ever been,”
she went on, “but there are
still cracks, and when I find
them, I have to figure out
what made them and how to
seal them up. Permanently.”
“What the fuck does that
mean?” My hands pushed
beneath her top, seeking her
bare skin.
She stiffened and pushed at
me, rejecting me. “Gideon, no
…”I sealed my mouth over
hers. Lifting her off her feet, I
took her to the floor. She
struggled and I growled,
“Don’t fight me.”
“You can’t just screw our
problems away.”
“I just want to screw you.”
My thumbs hooked into the
waistband of her shorts and
shoved them down. I was
frantic to be in her,
possessing her, feeling her
surrender. Anything to drown
out the voice in my head
telling me I’d fucked up.
Again. And this time, I
wouldn’t be forgiven.
“Let me go.” She rolled
onto her stomach.
My arms banded around
her hips when she tried to
crawl away. She could throw
me off as she’d been trained
to and she could cut me off
with a word. Her safe word
…
“Crossfire.”
Eva froze at the sound of
my voice and the one word
meant to convey the riot of
emotions she shattered me
with.
It was in that eye of the
storm that something
snapped. A fierce and
familiar quiet exploded
within me, silencing the panic
shaking my confidence. I
stilled, absorbing the sudden
absence of turmoil. It had
been a long time since I’d last
felt the dizzying switch
between chaos and control.
Only Eva could rock me so
deeply, sending me hurtling
back to a time when I’d been
at the mercy of everything
and everyone.
“You’re going to stop
fighting me,” I told her
calmly. “And I’m going to
apologize.”
She went lax in my arms.
Her submission was total and
swift. I had the upper hand
again.
I pulled her up and back, so
that she was sitting on my
thighs. Eva needed me in
control. When I was reeling,
she scattered, which only
shook me more. It was a
vicious cycle and I had to get
a better grip on it.
“I’m sorry.” Sorry for
hurting her. Sorry for losing
my command of the situation.
I’d been edgy after the
nightmare—something she’d
intuited—and getting hit with
Kline immediately after
hadn’t given me time to get
my shit together.
I would deal with him. I’d
keep a tight grasp on her.
Period. There were no other
options.
“I need your support,
Gideon.”
“I need you to tell him
you’re married.”
She leaned her temple
against my cheek. “I’m going
to.”
I shifted her to sit across
my lap and leaned back
against the wall, cradling her
close. Her arms wrapped
around my neck and my
world righted itself again.
Her hand slid down my
chest. “Ace …”
The coaxing note in her
voice was one I knew well. I
was hard in an instant, my
blood hot and thick.
Submitting to me turned Eva
on, and that reaction from her
fired me up like nothing else.
I pushed my hand into her
hair and fisted the soft gold
strands, watching the way her
eyes grew heavy-lidded at the
feel of the gentle tug. She was
restrained and at my mercy,
and she loved it. Needed it,
just as much as I did.
I took her mouth.
Then I took her.
WHILE Angus drove Eva and
me to work, I scrolled
through my appointment
calendar and thought of my
wife’s eight-thirty flight.
I glanced at her. “You’ll
take one of the jets to
California.”
She had been looking out
the window of the Bentley,
city-scoping with her usual
eager interest. She turned her
gaze to me.
I was born in New York.
I’d grown up in and near the
city and eventually began to
make it my own. At some
point, I’d stopped noticing it.
But Eva’s fascination and
delight with my hometown
had reintroduced it to me. I
didn’t study the city with the
intensity she did, but I saw it
with fresh eyes all the same.
“Will I?” she challenged,
her eyes betraying her
countering attraction to me.
Her fuck-me look kept me
redlined constantly.
“Yes.” I closed my tablet
case. “It’s faster, more
comfortable, and safer.”
Her mouth curved. “All
right.”
That hint of teasing
amusement captivated me,
made me want to do
everything wicked and raw to
her until only complete
surrender remained.
“You get to tell Cary,” she
went on, switching the cross
of her legs and revealing the
lacy edge of her stockings
and a peek of her garter.
She was wearing a red
sleeveless shirt and a white
skirt with strappy heels. A
perfectly acceptable
businesslike outfit that was
elevated by the body inside it
to understated sexiness.
Electricity arced between us,
the instinctive recognition
that we had been made to fit
together perfectly.
“Ask me to come with
you,” I said, hating the
thought of her being away
from me for an entire
weekend.
Her smile faded. “I can’t. If
I’m going to start telling
people we’re married, I have
to start with Cary, and I can’t
do that with you around. I
don’t want him to feel like
he’s on the outside of a life
I’m creating with you.”
“I don’t want to be on the
outside, either.”
She linked her fingers with
mine. “Spending private time
with friends doesn’t make us
any less of a couple.”
“I prefer to spend time with
you. You’re the most
interesting person I know.”
Her eyes widened and she
stared at me. Then she
exploded into movement,
hitching up her skirt and
straddling me before I
realized what she was doing.
Cupping my face in her
hands, she pressed her glossslick
lips to mine and kissed
me senseless.
“Umm,” I moaned, as she
pulled away breathlessly. My
fingers flexed into the
generous curve of her
gorgeous ass. “Do that
again.”
“I’m so hot for you right
now,” she breathed, rubbing
my lips clean with her thumb.
“I’m good with that.”
Her husky laugh slid all
around me. “I feel so
awesome right now.”
“Better than you did in the
hallway?” Her joy was
infectious. If I could’ve
stopped time, I would have at
that moment.
“That’s a different kind of
awesome.” Her fingertips tapdanced
on my shoulders. She
was … radiant when she was
happy, and her pleasure
brightened everything around
her. Even me. “That was the
best compliment, ace.
Especially coming from the
Gideon Cross. You meet
fascinating people every
day.”
“And wish they’d go away
so I can get back to you.”
Her eyes glistened. “God, I
love you so much it hurts.”
My hands shook and I dug
them into the backs of her
thighs to hide it from her. My
gaze wandered, trying to latch
on to something that would
anchor me.
If she only knew what she
did to me with those three
little words.
She hugged me. “I want
you to do something for me,”
she murmured.
“Anything. Everything.”
“Let’s have a party.”
Seizing the opportunity to
move on to other topics …
“Great. I’ll set up the swing.”
Pulling back, Eva shoved
at my shoulder. “Not that
kind of party, fiend.”
I sighed. “Bummer.”
She gave me a wicked
smile. “How about I promise
the swing in return for the
party?”
“Ah, now we’re talking.” I
settled back, enjoying her
immensely. “Tell me what
you have in mind.”
“Booze and friends, yours
and mine.”
“All right.” I considered
the possibilities. “I’ll see you
your booze and friends, and
raise you a quickie in a dark
corner somewhere during.”
Her throat worked on a
quick swallow and I smiled
inwardly. I knew my angel
well. Indulging her closet
exhibitionism was a complete
360 turnaround for me, and
though it still amazed me
when I thought about it, I
didn’t mind in the least.
There was nothing I wouldn’t
do for those moments when
the only thing that mattered to
her was being filled with my
cock.
“You drive a hard
bargain,” she said.
“Exactly my intention.”
“Okay, then.” She licked
her lips. “I’ll see you your
quickie and raise you a hand
job under the table.”
My brows rose. “Clothed,”
I countered.
Something that sounded
like a purr rumbled in the air
between us. “I think you need
to revisit and revise, Mr.
Cross.”
“I think you’ll need to
work harder to convince me,
Mrs. Cross.”
She was, as always, the
most invigorating negotiation
of my day.
WE separated on the
twentieth floor, where she
exited the elevator into the
Waters Field & Leaman
foyer. I was determined to get
her on my team and working
for me. It was an objective I
strategized every day.
When I reached my office,
my assistant was already at
his desk.
“Good morning,” Scott
greeted me, standing as I
approached. “PR called a few
minutes ago. They’re fielding
an unusual amount of
inquiries about a rumored
engagement between you and
Miss Tramell. They’d like to
know how to respond.”
“They should confirm.” I
passed him and went to the
coatrack in the corner behind
my desk.
He followed.
“Congratulations.”
“Thank you.” I shrugged
out of my jacket and slung it
on a hook. When I glanced at
him again, he was grinning.
Scott Reid handled myriad
tasks for me with quiet care,
which led others to often
underestimate him and allow
him to go unnoticed. On more
than one occasion, his
detailed observations of
individuals had proven
extremely insightful, and so I
overpaid him for his position
to keep him from going
anywhere else.
“Miss Tramell and I will
marry before the end of the
year,” I told him. “All
interview and photo requests
for either of us should be
routed through Cross
Industries. And tell security
downstairs the same. No one
should get to her without
going through me first.”
“I’ll let them know. Also,
Mr. Madani wanted to be
notified when you got in.
He’d like a few minutes with
you before the meeting this
morning.”
“I’m ready when he is.”
“Great,” Arash Madani
said, walking in. “There used
to be days when you were
here before seven. You’re
slacking off, Cross.”
I shot the lawyer a warning
look that carried no heat.
Arash lived to work and was
damned good at it, which is
why I hired him away from
his former employer. He’d
been the toughest counsel I
had ever run across, and in
the years since, that hadn’t
changed.
Gesturing at one of the two
chairs in front of my desk, I
took my seat and watched
him take his. His dark blue
suit was simple but bespoke,
his wavy black hair tamed by
a precision cut. Sharp
intelligence marked his dark
brown eyes, extending to a
smile that was more warning
than greeting. He was a friend
as well as an employee, and I
valued his lack of bullshit.
“We’ve received a
respectable bid on the
property on Thirty-sixth,” he
said.
“Oh?” A tangle of
emotions held my reply for a
moment. The hotel Eva hated
remained a problem as long
as I owned it. “That’s good.”
“That’s curious,” he shot
back, setting one ankle on the
opposite knee, “considering
how slowly the market’s
recovering. I had to dig
through several layers, but the
bidder is a subsidiary of
LanCorp.”
“Interesting.”
“Cocky. Landon knows the
next highest bid is a ways off
—about ten million ways. I
recommend we pull the
property off the market and
revisit in a year or two.”
“No.” Sitting back, I
waved away the suggestion.
“Let him have it.”
Arash blinked. “Are you
shitting me? Why are you in
such a hurry to get rid of that
hotel?”
Because I can’t keep it in
my holdings without hurting
my wife. “I have my reasons.”
“That’s what you said
when I advised you to sell it a
few years ago and you chose
to sink millions in
renovations into it instead. An
expense that you’re just
finally breaking even on, and
now you want to offload it in
a still-shaky market to a guy
who wants your head?”
“It’s never a bad time to
sell real estate in Manhattan.”
And certainly, never a bad
time to dump something Eva
called my “fuck pad.”
“There are better times,
and you know it. Landon
knows it. You sell to him,
you’ll only be encouraging
him.”
“Good. Maybe he’ll up his
game.”
Ryan Landon had an ax to
grind; I didn’t hold it against
him. My father had decimated
the Landon fortune and Ryan
wanted a Cross to pay for
that. He wasn’t the first or
last businessman to come
after me because of my
father, but he was the most
tenacious. And he was young
enough to have plenty of time
to dedicate to the task.
I looked at the photo of
Eva on my desk. All other
considerations were
secondary.
“Hey,” Arash said, lifting
his hands in mock surrender,
“it’s your business. I just
need to know if the rules have
changed.”
“Nothing’s changed.”
“If you believe that, Cross,
you’re further out of the game
than I thought. While
Landon’s plotting your ruin,
you’re off at the beach.”
“Stop kicking my ass for
taking a weekend off, Arash.”
I’d do it again in an instant.
Those days I’d spent with
Eva in the Outer Banks had
been every fucking dream I’d
never allowed myself to have.
I stood and walked to the
window. LanCorp’s offices
were in the high-rise two
blocks over, and Ryan
Landon’s office had a prime
view of the Crossfire
Building. I suspected he spent
more than a few moments
every day staring at my office
and planning his next move.
Occasionally, I stared back
and dared him to bring it
harder.
My father was a criminal
who’d destroyed countless
lives. He was also the man
who’d taught me how to ride
a bike and to sign my name
with pride. I couldn’t save
Geoffrey Cross’s reputation,
but I could damn sure protect
what I’d built out of his
ashes.
Arash joined me at the
window. “I’m not going to
say I wouldn’t hole up with a
babe like Eva Tramell if I
could. But I’d have my
goddamn cell phone with me.
Especially in the middle of a
high-stakes negotiation.”
Remembering how melted
chocolate tasted on Eva’s
skin, I thought a hurricane
could’ve been ripping
shingles off the roof and I
wouldn’t have given it a
second’s attention. “You’re
making me pity you.”
“LanCorp’s acquisition of
that software set you back
years in research and
development. And it’s made
him cocky.”
That was what really got
Arash’s blood up, Landon’s
pleasure in his own success.
“That software’s next to
worthless without PosIT’s
hardware.”
He glanced at me. “So?”
“Agenda item number
three.”
He faced me. “It said To Be
Determined on my copy.”
“Well, it says PosIT on my
mine. That game enough for
you?”
“Damn.”
My desk phone beeped,
followed by Scott’s voice
projecting from the speaker.
“A couple things, Mr. Cross.
Miss Tramell is on line one.”
“Thank you, Scott.” I
headed for the receiver with
the thrill of the hunt coursing
through my blood. If we
acquired PosIT, Landon
would be back to square one.
“When I’m clear, I need
Victor Reyes on the line.”
“Will do. Also, Mrs. Vidal
is at reception,” he went on,
stopping me in my tracks.
“Would you like me to
postpone the morning
meeting?”
I looked out the glass
partition that divided my
office from the rest of the
floor, even though I couldn’t
see my mother from that
distance. My hands clenched
at my sides. According to the
clock on my phone, I had ten
minutes to spare and my wife
on the line. The urge was
there to make my mother wait
until I could fit her in my
schedule, not hers, but I
shoved it down.
“Buy me twenty minutes,”
I told him. “I’ll take the calls
with Miss Tramell and Reyes,
then you can bring Mrs. Vidal
back.”
“Got it.”
I waited a beat. Then I
picked up the phone and hit
the rapidly blinking button.

“ANGEL.”
The impact of Gideon’s
voice on my senses was as
hard-hitting as it had been the
first time I’d heard it.
Cultured yet smoky with
sensuality, it knocked me for
a loop both in the darkness of
my bedroom and over the
phone, where I couldn’t be
distracted by that
incomparably gorgeous face
of his.
“Hi.” I slid my swivel chair
a little closer to my desk. “Is
it a bad time?”
“If you need me, I’m here.”
Something in his voice
didn’t hit me right. “I can call
back later.”
“Eva.” The authoritative
bite when he said my name
had my toes flexing in my
nude sling-back Louboutins.
“Say what you need.”
You, I almost said, which
was more than a little insane
considering he’d just fucked
my brains out only a couple
hours before. After he’d
fucked my brains out damn
near all night long.
Instead, I told him, “I need
a favor.”
“I’ll enjoy the payback.”
Some of the tension left my
shoulders. He’d hurt me by
mentioning Corinne the way
he had, and the argument that
followed was still fresh in my
mind. But I had to push it
aside, let it go. “Does security
have the home addresses of
everyone who works in the
Crossfire?”
“They have copies of IDs.
Tell me why you’re asking.”
“The receptionist here at
work is a friend of mine and
she’s been out sick all week.
I’m worried about her.”
“If you’re hoping to head
over to her place and check
up on her, you should get the
address from her.”
“I would if she’d return my
calls.” I ran my fingertip
around the lip of my coffee
mug and stared at the collage
of pictures of Gideon and me
that decorated my desk.
“Are you not on speaking
terms at the moment?”
“No, we’re not fighting or
anything. It’s just not like her
to not get in touch with me,
especially when she’s calling
in sick to work every day.
She’s a chatty girl, you
know?”
“No,” he drawled. “I have
no idea.”
If it had been any other guy
who’d said that, I would think
he was being sarcastic. But
not Gideon. I didn’t think
he’d ever really talked with
women in any meaningful
way. He was too often
clueless when interacting
with me, as if his social
development hadn’t quite
been well rounded when it
came to dealing with the
opposite sex.
“Then you’ll have to take
my word for it, ace. I just … I
want to make sure she’s all
right.”
“My lawyer’s standing
right here, but I don’t have to
ask him about the legality of
giving you the information
you’re asking for via the
means you’ve suggested. Call
Raúl. He’ll find her.”
“Really?” An image of the
dark-haired, dark-eyed
security specialist ran through
my mind. “Is he going to be
okay with that?”
“Angel, he’s paid to be
okay with everything.”
“Oh.” I fiddled with my
pen. I knew I shouldn’t feel
uncomfortable using
Gideon’s resources, but it
made me feel as if our
relationship were unbalanced
in his favor. While I didn’t
believe he would ever hold
that over me, I didn’t think
he’d see me as equal to him,
either, and that was really
important to me.
He had already taken care
of issues on his own that I
should’ve been a part of. Like
Sam Yimara’s horrid sex tape
of Brett and me. And Nathan.
Still, I asked, “How do I
reach him?”
“I’ll text you his number.”
“Okay. Thanks.”
“I want either myself,
Angus, or Raúl with you
when you go see her.”
“And that wouldn’t be
awkward at all.” I glanced at
Mark’s office to make sure
my boss didn’t need me for
anything. I tried not to make
personal calls at work, but
Megumi had been out for four
days straight without a single
returned call or text the whole
time.
“Don’t throw me that
‘chicks before dicks’ line,
Eva. You need to give me
something here.”
I got the subtext. He was
worried about me going to
San Diego and was letting
that issue slide. I had to bend
a little somewhere else in
return. “Okay, okay. If she’s
not back in the office on
Monday, we’ll figure out how
to handle it.”
“Good. Anything else?”
“No. That’s it.” My gaze
returned to a photo of him
and my heart hurt just a little,
the way it always did when I
looked at him. “Thank you. I
hope you have an amazing
day. I love you madly, you
know. And no, I don’t expect
you to say it back while your
lawyer’s hanging around.”
“Eva.” There was an
aching note in his voice that
moved me more than words
ever could. “Come see me
when you get off work.”
“Sure. Don’t forget to call
Cary about taking your jet.”
“Consider it done.”
I hung up and sat back in
my chair.
“Good morning, Eva.”
I swiveled to face Christine
Field, the executive chairman.
“Good morning.”
“I wanted to congratulate
you again on your
engagement.” Her gaze went
past my shoulder to the
framed photos behind me.
“I’m sorry, I hadn’t realized
you and Gideon Cross were
dating.”
“That’s okay. I try not to
talk about my personal life at
work.”
I made the statement
casually, because I didn’t
want to antagonize one of the
partners. Still, I hoped she got
the hint. Gideon was the
center of my life, but I needed
some parts of it to belong
only to me.
She laughed. “That’s good!
But just goes to show that I’m
not keeping my ear close
enough to the ground.”
“I doubt you’re missing
anything important.”
“Are you the reason Cross
approached us with the
Kingsman campaign?”
I winced inwardly. Of
course she’d think I would
recommend my employer to
my boyfriend, because she’d
assume Gideon and I had
been dating at least long
enough to make an
engagement plausible. Telling
her I had been with Waters
Field & Leaman longer than
I’d been with Gideon, when I
had been employed there only
a couple of months, would
open up speculation I didn’t
want floating around.
Worse, I was pretty certain
Gideon had used the vodka
campaign as an excuse to
draw me into his world on his
terms. That didn’t mean Mark
hadn’t done a phenomenal
job on the request for
proposal. I didn’t want my
relationship with Gideon to
shift any of the focus away
from my boss and his
accomplishments.
“Mr. Cross approached the
agency on his own,” I replied,
sticking to the truth. “Which
was a great decision. Mark
rocked that RFP.”
Christine nodded. “He did.
All right. I’ll let you get back
to work. Mark’s been singing
your praises, too, by the way.
We’re glad to have you on
our team.”
I managed a smile, but my
day was off to a rocky start.
First, Gideon knocked me
sideways with his Corinne
bullshit. Then, finding
Megumi still out sick. Now,
I’d rolled into being treated
differently at work because
my name was connected to
Gideon’s in a significant way.
Opening my inbox, I
started going through the
morning’s e-mail. I
understood that Gideon
wanted to make me feel what
he was feeling, so he’d
leveraged Corinne against
me. I’d known talking about
Brett was going to be a
problem, which was why I’d
put it off, but I hadn’t had an
ulterior motive in bringing it
up or when I’d kissed Brett,
either. I had hurt Gideon, yes,
but could sincerely say I
hadn’t consciously intended
to do so.
On the flip side, Gideon
had deliberately set out to
hurt me. I hadn’t realized he
was capable of that or willing
to do it. Something important
had shifted between us that
morning. I felt as if a core
column of trust had been
shaken.
Did he know that? Did he
understand how big a
problem that was?
My desk phone rang and I
answered with my usual
greeting.
“How long were you going
to wait to tell me about your
engagement?”
A sigh escaped me before I
could hold it back. My Friday
really was shaping up to be a
trial. “Hi, Mom. I was going
to call you during my lunch.”
“You knew last night!” she
accused. “Did he ask you on
the way to dinner? Because
you didn’t say anything about
a proposal when we talked
about him asking your father
and Richard for permission. I
saw the ring at Cipriani’s and
was pretty sure, but when you
didn’t say anything, I didn’t
push because you’ve been so
touchy lately. And—”
“And you’ve been
violating the law lately,” I
shot back.
“—Gideon was wearing a
ring, too, so I thought maybe
it was some kind of promise
thing or something—”
“It is.”
“—and then I read about
your engagement online! I
mean, really, Eva. No mother
should find out on the
Internet that her daughter is
getting married!”
I stared at my monitor
blankly, my heart rate kicking
up. “What? Where on the
Internet?”
“Take your pick! Page Six,
HuffPost … And let me tell
you again, there is no way I
can pull together a proper
wedding before the end of the
year!”
My daily Google alert
hadn’t hit my inbox yet, so I
did a quick search, typing so
quickly I spelled my own
name wrong. It didn’t matter.
Socialite Eva Tramell
has nabbed the brass
ring. Not literally, of
course. Multibillionaire
entrepreneur Gideon
Cross, whose name is
synonymous with excess
and luxury, wouldn’t
slide anything less than
platinum onto the finger
of the woman who’ll
bear his name. (see
photo at left) A source
at Cross Industries
confirmed the
significance of the giant
rock on Tramell’s left
hand. No comment was
made regarding the ring
Cross has been seen
wearing. (see photo at
right) A wedding is
planned before year’s
end. We have to wonder
what the rush is.
Operation Gideva Baby
Bump Watch has
commenced.
“Oh my God,” I breathed,
horrified. “I have to go. I
have to call Dad.”
“Eva! You need to come
over after work. We have to
talk about the wedding.”
Thankfully my dad was on
the West Coast, which bought
me at least three hours,
depending on his work
schedule. “I can’t. I’m going
to San Diego this weekend
with Cary.”
“I think you need to put off
any travel for a while. You
need to—”
“Start without me, Mom,” I
said desperately, glancing at
the clock. “I don’t have
anything specific in mind.”
“You can’t be seri—”
“Gotta go. Have to work.”
I hung up, then pulled open
the desk drawer that held my
smartphone.
“Hey.” Mark Garrity
leaned over the top of my
cubicle and offered me one of
his charming crooked smiles.
“Ready to roll?”
“Uh …” My finger
hovered over the home button
on my phone. I was torn
between doing what I was
paid to do—work—and
making sure my dad heard
about the engagement from
me. Usually, it wouldn’t be a
dilemma at all to choose. I
loved my job too much to risk
it by slacking off. But my dad
had been in a funk since he’d
messed around with my mom
and I was worried about him.
He wasn’t the kind of guy to
take sleeping with a married
woman lightly, even one he
was in love with.
I put the phone back in the
drawer. “Absolutely,” I
replied, pushing back from
my desk and grabbing my
tablet.
When I settled into my
usual seat in front of Mark’s
desk, I sent my dad a quick
text from my tablet saying I
had something important to
share with him and that I’d
call at noon.
It was the best I could do. I
could only hope it was
enough.

“MAN, YOU ARE smooth.”
I looked up at Arash after
setting the receiver back in its
cradle. “Are you still here?”
The attorney laughed and
settled back in his seat on my
office sofa. The view wasn’t
nearly as pleasant as the one
my wife had given me not too
long ago.
“Schmoozing the father-inlaw,”
he said. “I’m
impressed. I expect Eva will
be impressed, too. Bet you’re
counting on that heading into
the weekend.”
Damn right. I would need
all the points I could earn
when I met up with Eva in
San Diego. “She’s about to
go out of town. And you have
to head into the conference
room before they get too
restless in there. I’ll join you
as soon as I can.”
He stood. “Yes, I heard.
Your mother’s here. Let the
wedding insanity begin. Since
you’re free this weekend,
how about we round up some
of the usual suspects at my
place tonight? It’s been a
while, and your bachelor days
are numbered. Well,
technically they’re over, but
no one else knows that.”
And he was bound by
attorney-client privilege.
It took me a beat to decide.
“All right. What time?”
“Eight-ish.”
I nodded, then caught
Scott’s eye. He got the
message and rounded his
desk to head up to reception.
“Great.” Arash grinned.
“See you at the meeting.”
During the two minutes I
had alone, I texted Angus
about getting to California. I
still had unfinished business
there, and taking care of it
while Eva was visiting her
dad gave me a legitimate
excuse to be where she was.
Not that I absolutely needed
one.
“Gideon.”
As my mother entered, my
fingers curled into my palms.
Scott followed and asked,
“Are you sure I can’t get you
something, Mrs. Vidal?
Coffee, maybe? Or water?”
She shook her head. “No,
thank you. I’m fine.”
“All right.” He smiled and
left, pulling the door closed
behind him.
I hit the remote on my desk
that controlled the opacity of
the glass wall, blocking the
view from everyone on the
main floor. My mother
approached, looking slim and
elegant in dark blue slacks
and white blouse. She’d
pulled her hair back into a
sleek ebony bun, showing off
the flawless face that my
father had adored. Once, I’d
adored it, too. Now, I had
trouble looking at her.
And since we looked so
much alike, I sometimes had
trouble looking at myself.
“Hello, Mother. What
brings you into the city?”
She set her purse on the
edge of my desk. “Why is
Eva wearing my ring?”
The small pleasure I’d felt
at seeing her dissipated
instantly. “It’s my ring. And
the answer to your question is
obvious: She’s wearing the
ring because I gave it to her
when I proposed.”
“Gideon.” She pulled her
shoulders back. “You don’t
know what you’re getting
into with her.”
I forced myself to remain
facing her. I hated when she
looked at me with hurt in her
eyes. Blue eyes that were so
like mine. “I don’t have time
for this. I’ve put an important
meeting on hold to see you.”
“I wouldn’t have to come
to your office if you’d answer
my calls or come home once
in a while!” Her pretty pink
mouth tightened with
disapproval.
“That is not my home.”
“She’s using you, Gideon.”
I retrieved my coat.
“We’ve had this discussion.”
She folded her arms across
her chest like a shield. I knew
my mother; she was just
getting started. “She’s
involved with that singer,
Brett Kline. Did you know
that? And she’s got an ugly
side you’ve never seen. She
was downright vicious to me
last night.”
“I’ll speak with her.”
Straightening my coat with a
brisk tug on the lapels, I
headed toward the door. “She
shouldn’t be wasting her
time.”
My mother’s breath
caught. “I’m trying to help
you.”
“It’s a little too late for
that, don’t you think?”
She took a shaky step back
from the look I gave her. “I
know Geoffrey’s death was
hard on you. It was a difficult
time for all of us. I tried to
give you—”
“I’m not doing this here!” I
snapped, furious that she
would bring up something as
personal as my father’s
suicide while I was working.
That she would bring it up at
all. “You’ve hijacked my
morning and pissed me off.
Let me make it clear to you.
There is no scenario pitting
you against Eva where you
come out on top.”
“You’re not listening to
me!”
“There’s nothing you could
say that would affect
anything. If she wanted my
money, I’d give her every
cent. If she wanted another
man, I’d make her forget
him.”
She lifted an unsteady hand
to her hair, smoothing it
although not a single glossy
strand was out of place. “I
only want the best for you,
and she’s stirring up crap that
has been put away a long
time. It can’t be a healthy
relationship for you. She’s
creating a rift with your
family that—”
“We’ve been estranged,
Mother. Eva has nothing to
do with that.”
“I don’t want it to be like
this!” Stepping closer, she
held out her hand. A strand of
black pearls peeked out from
between the lapels of her
blouse, and a sapphire-faced
Patek Philippe adorned her
wrist. She hadn’t rebooted her
life after my father’s death;
she’d done a complete wipe
and restart. And never looked
back. “I miss you. I love
you.”
“Not enough.”
“That’s not fair, Gideon.
You won’t give me a
chance.”
“If you need a ride, Angus
is at your service.” I caught
the handle of the door and
paused. “Don’t come here
again, Mother. I don’t like
arguing with you. It would be
best for both of us if you just
stay away.”
I left the door open behind
me and headed toward the
conference room.
“YOU took this shot today?”
I looked up at Raúl, who
stood in front of my desk.
Dressed in a plain black suit,
he had the steady, watchful
gaze of a man who made his
living by seeing and hearing
everything.
“Yes,” he answered. “Not
more than an hour ago.”
I returned my attention to
the photo in front of me. It
was difficult looking at Anne
Lucas. The sight of her
foxlike face, with its sharp
chin and sharper eyes,
brought back memories I
wished I could erase from my
mind. Not just of her, but of
her brother, who’d been
similar in ways that made my
skin crawl.
“Eva said the woman had
long hair,” I murmured,
noting that Anne still had
cropped hair. I remembered
the plastic feel of it, the
sharp-gelled spikes scratching
my thighs as she deepthroated
my cock, working
desperately to get me hard
enough to fuck her.
I handed the tablet back to
Raúl. “Find out who it was.”
“Will do.”
“Did Eva call you?”
He frowned. “No.” But he
pulled out his smartphone and
checked it. “No,” he said
again.
“She may wait until you fly
out to San Diego. She wants
you to find a friend of hers.”
“No problem. I’ll take care
of it.”
“Take care of her,” I said,
holding his gaze.
“Doesn’t need to be said.”
“I know. Thank you.”
As he left my office, I sat
back in my chair. There were
a number of women in my
past who might cause
problems for me with my
wife. The women I’d slept
with were aggressive by
nature, ones who put me in
the position of needing to
take the upper hand. Eva was
the only woman who’d ever
grabbed the lead and made
me want more.
It was getting harder to let
her be away from me, not
easier.
“The team from Envoy is
here,” Scott said through the
speaker.
“Send them in.”
I powered through my day,
wrapping up the week’s
agenda and laying the
groundwork for more to
come. There was a lot I
needed to get off my plate
before I could take time off
with Eva. Our daylong
honeymoon had been perfect,
but far too short. I wanted at
least two weeks away with
her, preferably a month.
Someplace far away from
work and other commitments,
where I could have her all to
myself with no interruptions.
My smartphone vibrated on
my desktop and I looked at it,
surprised to see my sister’s
face on the screen. I’d texted
Ireland earlier to let her know
about the engagement. Her
reply had been a short and
simple, Yay! Stoked. Congrats,
bro!
I’d barely answered the
call with a quick hello when
she cut me off.
“I’m so fucking excited!”
she yelled, forcing me to pull
the phone away from my ear.
“Watch the mouth.”
“Are you kidding? I’m
seventeen, not seven. This is
so awesome. I’ve wanted a
sister forever, but figured I’d
be old and gray before you
and Christopher stopped
bouncing around and settled
down.”
I sat back in my chair. “I
live to serve.”
“Ha. Yeah, right. You done
good, you know. Eva’s a
keeper.”
“Yes, I know.”
“Thanks to her, I get to
harass you now. Always a
highlight of my day.”
My chest tightened, forcing
me to take a minute before I
could reply in an easy tone of
voice. “Oddly enough, it’s a
highlight of mine as well.”
“Well, yeah. It should be.”
Her voice lowered. “I heard
Mom losing her shit over it
earlier. She told Dad she went
to your work and you guys
got in a fight or something. I
think she’s kinda jealous.
She’ll get over it.”
“Don’t worry about it.
Everything’s fine.”
“I know. It just sucks that
she couldn’t keep it together
today of all days. Anyway,
I’m thrilled and wanted you
to know that.”
“Thank you.”
“But I’m not going to be
the flower girl. I’m too old
for that. I’m up for being a
bridesmaid, though. Even a
groomswoman or whatever.
Just sayin’.”
“All right.” My mouth
curved. “I’ll pass that along
to Eva.”
I’d just hung up when Scott
buzzed through my office
line.
“Miss Tramell is here,” he
announced, making me
realize how late in the day it
was. “And, as a reminder,
your videoconference with
the development team in
California is in five minutes.”
Pushing back from the
desk, I saw Eva round the
corner and come into view. I
could watch her walk for
hours. She had a sway to her
hips that made me ache to
fuck her and a determined tilt
to her chin that challenged
every dominant instinct I had.
I wanted to fist her ponytail
in my hand, take her mouth,
and grind against her. Just the
way I’d wanted to the first
time I saw her. And every
time since.
“Send along the proposal
deck to the team,” I told
Scott. “Tell them to review
and I’ll join in shortly.”
“Yes, sir.”
Eva swept through the
door.
“Eva.” I stood. “How was
your day?”
She rounded the desk, then
grabbed me by the tie.
I was instantly hard and
totally focused on her.
“I fucking love you,” she
said, before yanking my
mouth down to meet hers.
I hooked one arm around
her waist and felt around for
the opacity controls with my
other hand, all the while
letting her kiss me as if she
owned me. Which she did.
Absolutely.
The feel of her lips against
mine and the unmistakable
possessiveness of her actions
were exactly what I needed
after the day I’d had. Holding
her close, I turned and halfsat
on the edge of the desk,
pulling her in between my
thighs. I could say it was a
more secure way to hold her,
but honestly, my knees were
weak.
Her kisses did that to me.
Did what three hours of
sparring with my trainer
couldn’t do.
Inhaling through the rising
lust, I breathed her in,
allowing the delicate
fragrance of her perfume and
the provocative scent that was
hers alone to intoxicate me.
Her lips were soft and damp
against mine, demanding in
the subtlest of ways. Her
tongue licked delicately,
savoring, teasing and
arousing me effortlessly.
Eva kissed me as if I were
the most delicious thing she’d
ever tasted, a flavor she
craved and was helplessly
addicted to. The feeling was
heady and had become
necessary. I lived for her
kisses.
When she kissed me, I
knew I belonged right where I
was.
Tilting her head, she
moaned into my mouth, a soft
sound of pleasure and
surrender. Her fingers were in
my hair, sliding through it,
tugging it. That sensation of
being caught—claimed—
challenged me on the deepest
level. I drew her closer, until
the firmness of her belly
pressed against the hardness
of my erection.
My dick was throbbing,
aching.
“You’ll make me come,” I
murmured. All the effort I’d
once had to expend to
become aroused enough to
orgasm was unnecessary with
my wife. The fact that she
existed stirred my blood. The
strength of her desire was
enough to set me off.
She leaned back slightly,
breathless like me. “I don’t
mind.”
“I wouldn’t, either, if I
didn’t have a meeting
waiting.”
“I don’t want to hold you
up. I just want to thank you
for what you said to my dad.”
Smiling, I gave her ass a
two-handed squeeze. “My
lawyer said I’d score major
points for that.”
“Work was so busy, and I
didn’t have a chance to call
him until lunch. I was so
worried he’d hear about our
engagement before I could
tell him.” She shoved at my
shoulder. “You could’ve
given me a heads-up that you
were announcing it to the
world!”
I shrugged. “It wasn’t
planned, but I wasn’t going to
deny it when asked.”
Her lips twisted wryly. “Of
course not. Did you see that
ridiculous post about a baby
bump?”
“A frightening thought at
this point,” I said, trying to
keep my tone light despite the
sudden rush of alarm I felt.
“I’m planning on keeping you
all to myself for a while.”
“I know, right?” She shook
her head. “I was freaked out
that my dad would think I
was engaged and pregnant,
and just couldn’t be bothered
to let him know. It was such a
relief to call him and find out
you’d explained everything
and smoothed the way.”
“My pleasure.” I would set
the world on fire to clear a
path for her, if that’s what it
took.
Her hands went to work
unbuttoning my vest. My
brows arched in silent query,
but I wasn’t going to stop her.
“I haven’t even left yet,
and I’m missing you
already,” she said quietly,
straightening my tie.
“Don’t go.”
“If I were just going to
hole up with Cary for a bit,
I’d do it here at home and not
in San Diego.” She lifted her
gaze to my face. “But he’s a
head case over Tatiana being
pregnant. Plus, I need to
spend time with my dad.
Especially now.”
“Is there something you
should be telling me?”
“No. He sounded good
when I talked to him, but I
think he was hoping we’d
have more time together
before I got married. To him,
it seems like you and I just
met.”
I knew I should keep my
mouth shut, but I couldn’t.
“And we can’t forget Kline.”
Her jaw hardened. She
dropped her attention back to
where her fingers were
buttoning my vest. “I’m
leaving soon. I don’t want to
fight again.”
I caught her hands. “Eva.
Look at me.”
Staring into her stormy
eyes, I felt the tug in my
chest: a slow wrenching that
could turn me upside down.
She hadn’t stopped being
angry with me, and I couldn’t
stand it. “You still don’t
understand what you do to
me. How crazy you make
me.”
“Don’t give me that. You
shouldn’t have brought up
Corinne the way you did.”
“Maybe not. But be honest,
you brought up Kline this
morning because you’re
worried about seeing him.”
“I’m not worried!”
“Angel.” I gave her a
patient look. “You’re
worried. I don’t think you’d
sleep with him, but I do think
you’re anxious about crossing
a line you shouldn’t. You
needed a strong reaction from
me, so you were blunt and
you got it. You needed to see
what it would do to me. How
just the thought of you with
him makes me insane.”
“Gideon.” She gripped my
biceps. “Nothing is going to
happen.”
“I’m not making excuses.”
I brushed my fingertips
across her cheek. “I hurt you
and I’m sorry.”
“I’m sorry, too. I wanted to
avoid causing any problems
and they happened anyway.”
I knew she regretted our
fight. I could see it in her
eyes. “We’re learning as we
go. We’ll fuck up now and
again. You just have to trust
me, angel.”
“I have, Gideon. It’s why
we’ve gotten so far. But the
fact that you’d hurt me at all
—on purpose …” She shook
her head and I could see how
what I’d said was eating at
her. “You were always
supposed to be the one I
could count on to never hurt
me deliberately.”
Hearing her doubt her trust
in me was a hard blow. I took
the hit, then explained myself
the way I’d only ever done
with her. I would explain
anything, talk for hours, write
the promise in blood … if
that was what it took to make
her believe in me.
“There’s a difference
between deliberation and
malicious intent, wouldn’t
you agree?” I cupped her face
in my hands. “I promise I’ll
never cause you pain just to
hurt you. Don’t you see that
I’m just as vulnerable? You
have the same power to hurt
me.”
Her face softened, became
even more stunning. “I
wouldn’t.”
“But I did. You’ll have to
forgive me.”
She stepped back. “I hate
when you use that tone of
voice.”
Inclined toward selfpreservation,
I didn’t allow
the smile I felt to show. “But
it makes you wet.”
Tossing a glare at me over
her shoulder, Eva moved to
the window and stood in the
same spot I’d occupied that
morning. Her ponytail
showed off her beauty—and
left her no way to conceal her
emotions. Hot color rose in
her cheeks.
Did she know how often I
thought about tying her up
when she was riled like this?
Not to cage her or leash her,
but to hold that vibrant
energy of hers, that lust for
life I’d never learned to have.
She gave that to me,
surrendered it fully.
“Don’t try to control me
with sex, Gideon,” she said
with her back to me.
“I don’t want to control
you at all.”
“You manipulate me. You
do things … say things …
just to get a particular
response out of me.”
My arms crossed as I
remembered her kissing
Kline. “As do you, which we
just discussed.”
She faced me. “I’m
allowed to, I’m a woman.”
“Ah.” I smiled then. “I
knew that.”
“You’re such an enigma to
me.” She sighed and I could
see her letting the lingering
resentment go. “But you’ve
got me pegged. You know all
my buttons and just how to
push them.”
“If you think I don’t spend
a good percentage of every
day trying to figure you out,
you’re not paying attention.
Think about that while I
handle this meeting, and then
we’ll say good-bye properly.”
As I sat in my chair, her
gaze followed me. I adjusted
the fit of my headset and
paused when I realized she
was staring. She liked looking
at me. And hers was the only
avid hunger that had ever
made me feel good about
myself. I’d never had the
knee-jerk defensive reaction
to her sexual interest that
others provoked. She made
me feel loved and wanted in a
way that wasn’t the least
threatening.
“Watching you get into
business mode makes me
hot,” she explained, her voice
just husky enough to prevent
me from fully focusing on
work. “Sexy as hell.”
My lips twisted wryly.
“Angel, behave for fifteen
minutes.”
“What would be the fun in
that? Besides, you like me
bad.”
Damn straight.
“Fifteen minutes,” I
reiterated. Considering I’d
planned for the meeting to
take close to an hour, that was
a major concession.
“Do what you have to do.”
Eva stopped by my chair and
bent over like a pinup girl to
breathe in my ear. “I’ll find
something to occupy myself
with while you’re on the
phone playing with your
millions.”
My cock was abruptly,
painfully hard. She had said
something similar to me
when we’d first started
dating, and I had dreamed of
it in the weeks since.
I would have told her to
wait, but I knew she
wouldn’t. She had a
determined look in her eye
and a taunting swing to her
hips as she circled my desk.
I’d fucked up and she wanted
to get a piece of her own
back. Some couples punished
each other with pain or
deprivation. Eva and I, we
punished each other with
pleasure.
The moment she stepped
out of view, I logged into the
meeting without activating
my camera and I muted my
microphone. All half-dozen
participants were actively
discussing the materials Scott
had provided. I gave them a
moment to register that I’d
logged in …
… and used the time to
stand and open my fly.
Eva kicked off her heels.
“Good. It’ll go easier on you
if you cooperate.”
“You don’t actually believe
having your mouth wrapped
around my dick while I’m on
a videoconference is going to
be easy at any level.” Even
then, the team in California
was chiming in with greetings
through my headset. I ignored
them for the moment,
thinking only of what was
about to happen right there in
my office.
Only weeks ago the
possibility that I’d play while
working would’ve been
nonexistent. If Eva had been
wired any differently, I
would’ve made her wait until
I had the time and attention to
devote fully to her.
But my angel was a
dangerous lover, one who got
off on the thrill of being this
close to discovery. I would
never have known I enjoyed
that edge if not for her. There
were times I wanted to fuck
her for the entire world to see,
so it would be known
definitively how completely I
possessed her.
Her grin was pure
wickedness. “If you liked
things easy, you wouldn’t
have married me.”
And I was going to marry
her again, as soon as possible.
It wouldn’t be the last time.
We’d be renewing our vows
often, reminding each other
that we made a promise to be
together forever, no matter
what life threw at us.
Lowering gracefully to her
knees on the far side of my
desk, Eva set her hands on the
floor and prowled toward me
like a lioness on the hunt.
Through the smoked-glass
surface of my desktop, I
watched her move into place,
her tongue darting out to wet
her lips.
Anticipation coursed
through me, the rush of the
challenge and erotic
expectation. Everything about
my wife gave me pleasure,
but her mouth was in a class
by itself. She sucked me off
as if she were starved for my
cum, as if the taste were
something she was hooked
on. Eva gave me head
because she loved it.
Watching me unravel while
she did it was just a bonus.
I adjusted the spread of my
fly and pushed down the
waistband of my boxer briefs,
studying her face as I
revealed how she’d affected
me. Her lips parted as her
breath quickened, her body
shifting back until she was
sitting on her heels like a
supplicant.
Settling into my chair, I
absorbed the unaccustomed
feeling of restraint around my
thighs and the pull of elastic
beneath my balls. My
reaction was swift and
unpleasant, the sensation of
being bound dredging up
memories I kept ruthlessly
buried.
Reconsidering, I started to
roll back in my desk chair,
my heart rate rising …
Eva swallowed me.
“Fuck,” I hissed, my
fingers digging into the
armrests as her fingers dug
into my hips.
The rush of wet heat over
the sensitive crown of my
cock was shockingly intense.
Hard suction tightened
around me and a satin-soft
tongue massaged the perfect
spot. Through the pounding
of my heart, I heard the team
questioning whether my
webcam and headset were
working properly …
Straightening my spine, I
slid forward and activated my
feeds. “Excuse the delay,” I
said briskly as Eva took more
of me. “Now that you’ve had
the chance to review the
deck, let’s discuss the steps
you’ll be taking to implement
the recommended
adjustments.”
Eva hummed her approval
and the vibration reverberated
through me. I was hard
enough to drive nails and her
slender fingers were teasing
me, stroking with just enough
pressure to make me want
more.
Tim Henderson, the project
manager and team leader,
spoke first. I could barely
focus, seeing him more from
memory than the monitor in
front of me. A tall, painfully
thin man with pale skin and a
wild mane of dark curls, he
liked to talk, which was a
blessing considering how dry
my mouth had become.
“I’d like more time to
review this,” he began, “but
off the cuff, I’m thinking this
is a seriously accelerated
schedule. Some of this is
great and I’m excited about
seeing what we can do with
it, but phasing into consumer
beta testing is at least a year
away, not six months.”
“That’s what you told me
six months ago,” I reminded
him, my fist clenching as Eva
took my cock to the back of
her throat. Sweat bloomed on
the back of my neck when
she pulled off, her mouth a
hot velvet suction.
“We lost our top designer
to LanCorp—”
“And I offered a
replacement, which you
declined.”
Henderson’s jaw tightened.
He was a coding genius with
a brilliant creative mind, but
he didn’t play well with
others and was resistant to
outside intervention. That
would be his prerogative … if
he weren’t eating my time
and money.
“A creative team is a
delicate balance,” he argued.
“You can’t just plug a
random person into the void.
We’ve got the right man on
the job now—”
“Thank you,” Jeff
Simmons interjected, his
angular face breaking into a
grin at the praise.
“—and we’re making
progress,” Tim went on. “We
—” “—keep blowing through
your self-imposed deadlines.”
My tone was gruffer than I
intended due to my wife’s
wickedly agile tongue. Soft,
playful licks from root to tip
were driving me half out of
my mind. My thighs ached
with strain, the muscles
hardened by the force it took
to keep me in my chair. She
was following the line of
every sensitive vein, stroking
over the throbbing ridges
with the flat of her tongue.
“While creating an
exceptional and
groundbreaking user
experience,” he shot back.
“We’re getting the job done
and we’re doing it right.”
I wanted to bend Eva over
my desk and fuck her. Hard.
To do that, I needed to get
through the damn meeting.
“Excellent. Now, you just
need to do it faster. I’m
sending out a team to help
you achieve the objectives on
time. They’ll—”
“Now, wait a minute,
Cross,” Henderson snapped,
leaning closer to the webcam.
“You send some corporate
bean counters over to breathe
down our necks and you’re
only going to slow us down!
You need to leave the
development to us. If we need
your help, we’ll ask for it.”
“If you thought I’d give
you my money and be a silent
partner, you didn’t do your
homework.”
“Uh-oh,” Eva murmured,
her eyes bright with laughter
beneath the glass.
I reached beneath the desk
and cupped her nape,
squeezing. “The app space is
highly competitive. That’s
why you approached me. You
presented me with a unique
and intriguing gaming
concept, and a one-year
development-to-rollout
timeline, which was judged
by my team to be reasonable
and achievable.”
I paused on a breath,
tormented by the feel of
warm lips gliding up and
down my raging dick. Eva
was working with purpose
now, driving me on with hard
pumps of her fist. There was
no more buildup, no teasing.
She wanted me to come.
Now.
“You’re looking at this
from the wrong perspective,
Mr. Cross,” Ken Harada said,
running his hand over a blue
goatee. “Technical timelines
don’t make allowances for an
organic creative process. You
don’t understand how—”
“Don’t make me the villain
here.” The urge to thrust, to
fuck, was clawing.
Aggression built in me like a
tidal wave, forcing me to
fight for any semblance of
civility. “You guaranteed ontime
delivery of all elements
on a schedule you created and
you’re not holding up your
end. I’m now forced to help
you keep the promises you
made.”
The artist slumped back in
his seat, muttering under his
breath.
Tightening my grip on
Eva’s neck, I tried to slow her
down. Then I gave up and
started moving her, urging
her roughly to suck faster.
Harder. To drain me. “This is
how this is going to play out.
You’ll work with the team
I’m sending. If you miss
another deadline, I’m pulling
Tim off oversight.”
“Bullshit!” he shouted.
“This is my fucking app! You
can’t take it from me.”
I needed finesse but had
none, my brain hazed with
the animal need to mate.
“You should’ve read the
contract more carefully. Do
that tonight and we’ll revisit
tomorrow after the team
arrives.”
After I come …
Tingles raced along my
spine. My balls drew up. I
was a minute away, and Eva
knew it. Her cheeks were
hollowing with the force of
her suction, her tongue
fluttering over the sensitive
underside of my cockhead.
My heart was pounding, my
palms damp with
perspiration.
Staring into a half-dozen
angry faces with a riot of
protests exploding from my
earpiece, I felt the orgasm hit
me like a freight train. I
fumbled for the mute button
and let the groan tear from
my throat as I spurted
powerfully into Eva’s
greedily working mouth. She
moaned and milked my dick
with both hands, pulling and
squeezing as I kept coming in
a flood I couldn’t stop.
I felt the heat race up into
my face. Staring stonily into
my monitor, I fought the urge
to close my eyes and throw
my head back, to free myself
to absorb the singular
pleasure of coming for my
wife. Coming because of her.
As the pressure eased, I
released her hair and touched
her cheek with my fingertips.
I unmuted my microphone.
“My admin will call you in
a few minutes,” I cut in, my
voice hoarse, “to arrange
tomorrow’s meeting. I hope
we can come to an amicable
agreement. Until then.”
I shut down my browser
and yanked off my headset.
“Come here, angel.”
My chair was shoved back
and I’d hauled her out before
she had the chance to come
out on her own.
“You’re a machine!” she
gasped, her voice as rough as
mine, her lips red and
swollen. “I can’t believe you
didn’t even twitch! How can
you— Oh!”
The tiny scrap of lace she
wore as underwear dropped
to the floor in pieces.
“I liked those panties,” she
said breathlessly.
Lifting her, I set her bare
ass on the cool glass, aligning
her perfectly to take my cock.
“You’ll like this more.”
“ANGEL.”
Like a sleepy kitten, Eva
blinked at me as I stepped out
of my office washroom.
“Hmm?”
I grinned at finding her still
slumped in my desk chair. “I
assume you’re okay.”
“Never better.” She
reached up and ran a hand
over her hair. “Missing the
brain you just fucked out of
me, but otherwise, I’m
feeling excellent, thank you
very much.”
“You’re welcome.” I
headed toward her with a
warm damp washcloth.
“Are you trying to set a
new record for most orgasms
in a single day?”
“An intriguing proposition.
I’m willing to give it a shot.”
She held out her hand as if
to ward me off. “No more,
maniac. You screw me again
and I’ll be a drooling,
babbling idiot.”
“Let me know if you
change your mind.” I kneeled
in front of her and urged her
legs open. Waxed smooth and
pretty pink, her cunt was
lovely. Perfect.
She watched me as I
cleaned her, her fingers
reaching out to comb through
my hair. “Don’t work too
hard this weekend, okay?”
“As if there’s something
else worth doing without you
around,” I murmured.
“Sleep in. Read a book.
Plan a party.”
My mouth quirked. “I
haven’t forgotten. I’m asking
the guys tonight.”
“Oh?” The laziness left her
eyes. I pulled back before her
legs closed. “What guys?”
“The ones you want to
meet.”
“You’re calling them?
I stood. “We’re getting
together.”
“To do what?”
“Drink. Hang out.”
Returning to the bathroom, I
tossed the washcloth in the
hamper and washed my
hands.
Eva followed me. “At a
club?”
“Maybe. Probably not.”
She lounged against the
doorjamb and crossed her
arms. “Are any of them
married?”
“Yes.” I slung the hand
towel back on the rack. “Me.”
“That’s it? Is Arnoldo
going to be there?”
“Maybe. Likely.”
“What’s up with the short
answers?”
“What’s up with the
interrogation?” I asked the
question, but I knew. My wife
was a jealous, possessive
woman. Lucky for both of us,
I liked it. A lot.
She shrugged, but it was a
defensive gesture. “I just
want to know what you’re
doing, that’s all.”
“I’ll stay home if you
will.”
“I’m not asking you to do
that.”
There was a smudge of
dark makeup beneath her
eyes. I loved mussing her up
and giving her that justfucked
look. No woman wore
it better. “Get to the point,
then.”
She made a frustrated
noise. “Why won’t you tell
me what you guys have
planned?”
“I don’t know, Eva.
Usually we meet at one of our
places and drink. Play cards.
Sometimes we go out.”
“Trolling. A group of hot
guys who’ve got a buzz and
want a good time.”
“That’s not a crime. And
who said they’re attractive?”
She shot me a look.
“They’re trolling with you.
That means they’re either hot
enough not to completely
pale in your shadow or too
confident to worry about it.”
I held up my left hand. The
bloodred rubies in my
wedding band caught the
light. I never took the ring off
and never would. “Remember
this?”
“I’m not worried about
you,” she muttered, her arms
dropping to her sides. “If I’m
not fucking you enough, you
need help.”
“Says the wife who
couldn’t wait fifteen
minutes.”
She stuck her tongue out at
me.
“That’s what got you
fucked right there.”
“Arnoldo doesn’t trust me,
Gideon. He doesn’t really
want you with me.”
“It’s not his decision to
make. And some of your
friends aren’t going to like
me, either. I know Cary’s on
the fence.”
“What if Arnoldo tells the
others how he feels about
me?”
“Angel.” I went to her and
caught her by the hips.
“Talking about feelings is
predominantly female
territory.”
“Don’t be sexist.”
“You know I’m right.
Besides, Arnoldo knows how
it is. He’s been in love
before.”
She looked up at me with
those uniquely beautiful eyes.
“Are you in love, Mr. Cross?”
“Irrevocably.”
MANUEL Alcoa slapped me on
the back as he rounded me.
“You just cost me a thousand
dollars, Cross.”
I leaned against the kitchen
island and shoved my hand
into the pocket of my jeans,
wrapping it around my
smartphone. Eva was midflight
and I was alert for any
word from her or Raúl. I’d
never feared flying, never
worried over someone’s
safety while traveling. Until
now.
“How so?” I asked, before
taking a swig of my beer.
“You are the last man I
figured would tie the knot and
you turn out to be the first.”
Manuel shook his head.
“Kills me.”
I lowered the bottle. “You
bet against me?”
“Yeah. Although I suspect
someone had the inside
scoop.” The portfolio
manager narrowed his eyes
across the island at Arnoldo
Ricci, who lifted one shoulder
in a shrug.
“If it’s any consolation,” I
said, “I’d have bet against
me, too.”
Manuel grinned. “Latinas
rule, my friend. Sexy, curvy.
More than a handful in bed
and out. Hot tempered.
Passionate.” He hummed.
“Good choice.”
“Manuel!” Arash yelled
from the living room. “Bring
those limes over here.”
I watched Manuel leave the
kitchen with the bowl of lime
slices. Arash’s condo was
modern and spacious with a
panoramic view of the East
River. There was a notable
lack of walls except for those
hiding the bathrooms.
Circling the granite-topped
island, I approached Arnoldo.
“How are you?”
“Good.” His gaze dropped
to the amber liquid he swirled
in a tumbler. “I’d ask you the
same, but you look well. I’m
glad.”
I didn’t waste time with
small talk. “Eva worries that
you’ve got a problem with
her.”
He glanced at me. “I’ve
never been disrespectful to
your woman.”
“She never said you were.”
Arnoldo drank, taking a
moment to savor the fine
liquor before swallowing it.
“I understand that you are—
what’s the word?—held
captive by this woman.”
“Captivated,” I provided,
wondering why he didn’t just
speak in Italian.
“Ah, yes.” He gave me a
slight smile. “I have been
there, my friend, as you
know. I don’t judge you.”
I knew Arnoldo
understood. I’d found him in
Florence, recovering from the
loss of a woman by drowning
in liquor and cooking like a
madman, producing so much
five-star cuisine he was
giving it away. I had been
fascinated by the totality of
his despair and unable to
relate.
I’d been so certain I would
never know anything like it.
Like the opacity and
soundproofing of the glass
wall in my office, my view of
life had been dulled. I knew
I’d never be able to explain to
Eva how she’d appeared to
me the first time I saw her, so
vibrant and warm. A colorful
explosion in a black-andwhite
landscape.
“Voglio che sia felice.” It
was a simple statement, but
the crux of the issue. I want
her to be happy.
“If her happiness depends
on what I think,” he answered
in Italian, “you ask too much.
I will never say anything
against her. I’ll always treat
her with the respect I feel for
you as long as you are
together. But what I believe is
my choice and my right,
Gideon.”
I looked over at Arash,
who was lining up shot
glasses on the bar in the
living room. As my lead
attorney, he knew about both
my marriage and Eva’s sex
tape, and he didn’t have a
problem with either one.
“Our relationship is …
complex,” I explained
quietly. “I’ve hurt her as
much as she’s ever hurt me—
likely more.”
“I’m not surprised to hear
that, but I am sorry.” Arnoldo
studied me. “You couldn’t
choose one of the other
women who’ve loved you
and would give you no
trouble? A comfortable
ornament who would settle
into your life without a
ripple?”
“As Eva says, what would
be the fun in that?” My smile
faded. “She challenges me,
Arnoldo. Makes me see
things … think about things,
in ways I didn’t before. And
she loves me. Not like the
others.” I reached for my
phone again.
“You didn’t allow the
others to love you.”
“I couldn’t. I was waiting
for her.” A thoughtful
expression crossed his face
and I said, “I can’t imagine
your Bianca was hassle-free.”
He laughed. “No. But my
life is simple. I can use
complications.”
“My life was ordered.
Now, it’s an adventure.”
Arnoldo sobered, his dark
eyes growing serious. “But
that wildness in her that you
love is what worries me
most.”
“Stop worrying.”
“I will mention this only
once, then never again. You
may be angry with me for
what I say, but understand
that my heart is in the right
place.”
My jaw tightened. “Get it
off your chest.”
“I sat with Eva and Brett
Kline at dinner. I observed
them together. There is
chemistry there, not unlike
what I saw between Bianca
and the man she left me for. I
wish I believed Eva would
ignore it, but she’s already
proven that she can’t.”
I held his gaze. “She had
her reasons. Reasons I gave
her.”
Arnoldo took another
drink. “Then I’ll pray that
you don’t give her more
reasons.”
“Hey,” Arash shouted.
“Cut it out with the Italian
and get your asses in here.”
Arnoldo touched his glass
to my bottle before passing
me.
I finished my beer alone,
taking a moment to consider
what Arnoldo had said.
Then I joined the party.

“WHAT’S GOT YOU frowning,
baby girl?” Cary asked, his
voice low and sleepy from the
Dramamine he’d downed at
takeoff.
Staring at the choices in the
dropdown menu my cursor
hovered over, I debated
which to pick. Engaged or
It’s complicated? Since
Married also applied¸ I
thought All of the above
should’ve been an option.
Wouldn’t that be fun to
explain?
Glancing across the
luxurious cabin of Gideon’s
private jet, I found my best
friend sprawled along the
white leather sofa with his
hands tucked behind his head.
Long and lean, he was a
pretty picture with his shirt
riding high and his cargo
pants riding low, exposing the
amazing abs that were
helping Grey Isles to sell
jeans, underwear, and other
men’s clothing.
Cary had no problem
whatsoever accustoming
himself to the luxurious
conveniences of Gideon’s
immense wealth. He’d settled
immediately and comfortably
into the elegant appointments
of the ultra-modern cabin.
And somehow, even casually
dressed, he looked perfectly
at home amid the brushed
steel and gray oak.
“I’m trying to set up some
social media accounts,” I
answered.
“Whoa.” He sat up with
effortless grace, his posture
surprisingly and instantly
alert. “Big step.”
“Yeah.” Nathan had kept
me hiding, afraid to put
myself out there and risk
making it easy for him to find
me. “But it’s time. I feel like
… Never mind. It’s just
time.”
“All right.” He set his
elbows on his knees and
tapped his fingertips together.
“Then why is your face all
scrunched up like that?”
“Well, there’s a lot to
consider. I mean, how much
do I share out there? I don’t
have to worry about Nathan
anymore, but Gideon is under
constant scrutiny.”
With my thoughts on
Gideon, I ran a search for his
profile. It popped up with the
little blue check mark that
told me it was verified as
belonging to him. The sight
of his picture, a shot of him in
a black three-piece suit and
the blue tie I loved, sent a
pang of longing through me.
He’d been photographed on a
rooftop with the skyline of
Manhattan fuzzily out of
focus behind him, while he
was sharply and vividly
captured by the camera’s
lens.
He was even sharper and
more vibrant in reality. I
stared into Gideon’s eyes,
getting lost in that impossible
blue. His black hair framed
that perfect fallen-angel face
in strands of glossy, inky silk.
Poetic? Yes. But then his
looks could inspire sonnets.
To say nothing of spur-ofthe-
moment marriage.
When had the photo been
taken? Before we’d met? He
had the implacable, remote
look that made him seem like
such an impossible dream.
“I’m married,” I blurted
out, tearing my gaze away
from the most gorgeous man
I’d ever seen. “To Gideon, of
course. Who else would I be
married to?”
Cary froze while I rambled.
“Come again?”
I rubbed my palms on my
yoga pants. It was a cop-out
telling him the news while
motion sickness drugs lulled
his brain, but I’d take any
advantage I could get. “When
we went away last weekend.
We eloped.”
He was quiet for a long,
weighted minute. Then he
exploded to his feet. “Are you
shitting me?”
Raúl’s head turned in our
direction. The movement was
casual and unhurried, but his
gaze was vigilant and
watchful. He sat in the far
corner, being eerily
unobtrusive for such a hardto-
miss guy.
“What’s the damned rush?”
Cary snapped.
“It just … happened.” I
couldn’t explain it. I’d
thought it was too soon. Still
did. But Gideon was the only
man I would ever love so
completely. When I
considered that, I knew
Gideon had been right; we’d
only be postponing the
inevitable. And Gideon
needed my promise that I was
his forever. My amazing
husband who found it so hard
to believe he could be loved.
“I’m not sorry.”
“Not yet.” Cary shoved
both hands into his hair.
“Jesus, Eva. You don’t up
and marry the first guy you
have a serious relationship
with.”
“It’s not like that,” I
protested, awkwardly
avoiding looking at Raúl.
“You know how we feel
about each other.”
“Sure. You two are whack
jobs separately. Together,
you’re a goddamn nut house.”
I flipped him the bird.
“We’ll work on it. Wearing a
ring doesn’t mean we stop
figuring things out.”
He dropped into the chair
across from me. “What
incentive has he got to fix
anything? He’s bagged and
tagged the prize. You’re stuck
with his psychotic dreams
and Grand Canyon–sized
mood swings.”
“Wait a minute,” I said
tightly, feeling the sting of
truth in his words. “You
didn’t get upset when I told
you we were engaged.”
“Because I figured it’d be a
year, at the very least, before
Monica got the wedding
worked out. Maybe a year
and a half. At least some time
for you two to try living
together.”
I let him rant. Better that he
did it at thirty thousand feet
than in some public venue
where the whole world could
hear.
He leaned closer, his green
eyes fierce. “I’m having a
baby and I’m not getting
married. You know why?
Because I’m too fucked up
and I know it. I’ve got no
business hitching a passenger
on this wild ride. If he loved
you, he’d be thinking about
you and what’s best for you.”
“I’m so glad you’re happy
for me, Cary. That means a
lot.”
The words dripped with
sarcasm, but they were honest
in their own way. There were
girlfriends I could call who
would tell me what an
amazingly lucky bitch I was.
Cary was my closest friend
because he always gave it to
me straight, even when I
desperately wanted
sugarcoating.
But Cary was thinking only
about the darkness. He didn’t
understand the light Gideon
brought into my life. The
acceptance and the love. The
safety. Gideon had given me
my freedom back, a life
without terror. Giving him
vows in return was too simple
a repayment for that.
I turned my attention back
to Gideon’s profile, scrolling
down to see that the most
recent post was a link to an
article about our engagement.
I doubted he’d posted it
himself; he was too busy to
bother with something like
that. But I figured he’d
approved it. If not, he had
somehow already made it
clear that I was important
enough to become the one bit
of personal news that was
okay to be shared on an
otherwise business-focused
profile.
Gideon was proud of me.
Proud to be marrying me, a
hot mess with a history of bad
choices. Whatever anyone
else thought, I knew I was the
one who’d bagged and tagged
the prize.
“Fuck.” Cary slouched into
the chair. “Make me feel like
an ass.”
“If the shoe fits …” I
muttered, clicking on the link
to view other photos of
Gideon.
It was a mistake.
All the pictures posted by
his social media admin were
business-related, but the
unofficial pictures he’d been
tagged in weren’t. There, in
living color, were images of
him with beautiful women.
And they hit me hard.
Jealousy clawed and twisted
my stomach.
God, he looked amazing in
a tuxedo. Dark and
dangerous. His face savagely
beautiful, his cheekbones and
mouth chiseled perfection, his
posture confident and more
than a little arrogant. An
alpha male in his prime.
I knew the photos weren’t
recent. I knew the women in
them didn’t have firsthand
knowledge of his insanely
mad skills in bed; he had a
rule about that. Neither of
which stopped the images
from making me twitchy.
“Am I the last to know?”
Cary asked.
“You’re the only one.” I
glanced at Raúl. “At least on
my side. Gideon wants to tell
the world, but we’re going to
keep it under wraps.”
He studied me. “For how
long?”
“Forever. The next
wedding we have will be our
first as far as anyone else is
concerned.”
“You having second
thoughts?”
It killed me that Cary
didn’t care that we had an
audience. I was hyperaware
that every move I made,
every word I said was being
witnessed.
Not that Raúl’s presence
had any effect on my answer.
“No. I’m glad we’re married.
I love him, Cary.”
I was glad Gideon was
mine. And I missed him.
Worse after seeing those
pictures.
“I know you do,” Cary said
with a sigh.
Unable to help myself, I
opened the messaging app on
my laptop and sent Gideon a
text. I miss you.
He texted back almost
instantly. Turn the plane
around.
That made me smile. It was
so like him. And so unlike
me. Wasting the pilots’ time,
the fuel … it seemed so
frivolous to me. More than
that, though, would be the
proof of how dependent on
Gideon I’d become. That
would be the kiss of death in
our relationship. He could
have anything, any woman, at
any time. If I ever became too
easy for him, we’d both lose
respect for me. Losing his
love wouldn’t be far behind.
I returned to my new
profile and uploaded a selfie
I’d taken with Gideon that I
synced from my smartphone.
I made it the masthead image.
Then I tagged him and gave it
a description: The love of my
life. After all, if his photos were
going to include him with
women, I wanted at least one
of them to be me. And the
one I’d chosen was
undeniably intimate. We lay
on our backs, our temples
touching, my face bare of
makeup and his relaxed with
a smile in his eyes. I dared
anyone to look at it and not
see that I had a private bond
with him the world would
never know.
I suddenly wanted to call
him. So badly that I could
almost hear that amazingly
sexy voice, as intoxicating as
top-shelf liquor, smooth with
just a hint of bite. I wanted to
be with him, my hand in his,
my lips against his throat
where the smell of his skin
called to something hungry
and primitive inside me.
It scared me sometimes,
how much I needed him. To
the exclusion of everything
else. There was no one I
wanted to be with more,
including my best friend, who
was at that moment needing
me almost as fiercely.
“It’s all good, Cary,” I
assured him. “Don’t worry.”
“I’d be more worried if I
thought you actually believed
that.” He shoved the bangs
off his forehead with an
impatient hand. “It’s too
soon, Eva.”
I nodded. “But it’ll work
out.”
It had to. I couldn’t
imagine my life without
Gideon in it.
Cary’s head dropped back
and his eyes closed. I might
have thought he was
succumbing to the motion
sickness pills, except his
knuckles were white from
gripping the armrests too
tightly. He was taking the
news hard. I didn’t know
what I could say to reassure
him.
You’re still heading in the
wrong direction, Gideon texted.
I almost asked him how he
knew that, but caught myself.
Are you having a good time with
the guys?
I’d have more fun with you.
I grinned. I would hope so.
My fingers paused, then: I told
Cary.
The answer wasn’t
instantaneous. Still friends?
He hasn’t disowned me yet.
He didn’t say anything to
that, and I told myself not to
read too much into his
silence. He was out with his
guys. It had been asking a lot
to even hear from him at all.
Still, I was super happy to
get a text from him ten
minutes later.
Don’t stop missing me.
I looked over at Cary and
found him watching me. Was
Gideon facing similar
disapproval from his friends?
Don’t stop loving me, I texted
back.
His answer was simple and
very much Gideon. Deal.
“SoCAL, baby, I missed you.”
Cary descended the steps
from the plane to the tarmac,
tilting his head back to look
up at the night sky. “God, it’s
good to leave that East Coast
humidity behind.”
I scrambled down after
him, eager to get to the tall,
dark figure waiting by a shiny
black Suburban. Victor Reyes
was the kind of male who
commanded attention. Part of
that was due to his being a
cop. The rest was all him.
“Dad!” I ran full bore
toward him and he unfolded
from where he’d been leaning
against the SUV and opened
his arms to me.
He absorbed the crash of
my body into his and lifted
me off my feet, squeezing me
so tightly I couldn’t breathe.
“It’s good to see you, baby,”
he said gruffly.
Cary sauntered up to us.
My dad put me down.
“Cary.” My dad clasped
Cary’s hand, then pulled him
in for a quick hug and a
hearty slap on the back.
“Looking good, kid.”
“I try.”
“Got everything?” my dad
asked. He eyed Raúl, who’d
exited the plane first and now
stood silently near a black
Benz that had been parked
and waiting close by.
Gideon had told me to
forget that Raúl was there.
That wasn’t easy for me to
do.
“Yep,” Cary answered,
adjusting the weight of his
duffel strap on his shoulder.
He carried my bag, which
was lighter than his, in his
hand. Even with all my
makeup and three pairs of
shoes, Cary had packed more
than me.
I loved that about him.
“You two hungry?” My
dad opened the passenger
door for me.
It was just past nine in
California, but after midnight
in New York. Too late for me
to eat usually, but we hadn’t
grabbed dinner.
Cary answered before
climbing into the backseat.
“Starved.”
I laughed. “You’re always
hungry.”
“So are you, sweet
cheeks,” he shot back, sliding
into the center seat so he
could lean forward and be in
the mix. “I’ve just got no
guilt about it.”
We pulled away from the
jet and I watched it grow
smaller as we cruised down
the tarmac toward the exit. I
glanced at my dad’s profile,
looking for any hint of his
thoughts about the lifestyle
I’d be living as Gideon’s
wife. The private jets. The
full-time bodyguards. I knew
how he felt about Stanton’s
wealth, but that was my
stepdad. I was hoping a
husband would be cut some
slack.
Still, I knew the change in
routine was glaring.
Previously, we would’ve
flown into San Diego’s
harbor. We would have
headed to the Gaslamp and
grabbed a table at Dick’s Last
Resort, spending an hour or
more laughing at the silliness
and enjoying a beer with
dinner.
There was tension now that
hadn’t been there before.
Nathan. Gideon. My mom.
They were all hovering
between us.
It sucked. Massively.
“What about that place in
Oceanside with the slushy
beer and peanut shells on the
floor?” Cary suggested.
“Yeah.” I twisted in my
seat to give him a grateful
smile. “That’d be fun.”
Laid-back and familiar.
Perfect.
I could tell my dad thought
so, too, when I looked at him
and his mouth quirked. “You
got it.”
We left the airport behind.
I dug out my phone and
turned it on, wanting to sync
it to the Suburban’s sound
system so we could listen to
music that would take us back
to less complicated times.
Texts popped up so fast,
they filled my screen then
scrolled off.
The most recent one was
from Brett. Call me when you
get into town.
And right on cue, “Golden”
started playing on the radio.
I was climbing the steps of
my dad’s tiny porch the next
day when my phone started
vibrating. I pulled it out of
my shorts pocket and felt a
tingle of happiness at the
sight of Gideon’s picture on
the screen.
“Good morning,” I
answered, settling into one of
the two cushioned wroughtiron
chairs near the front
door. “Did you sleep well?”
“Well enough.” The
beloved soft rasp of his voice
slid sweetly through me.
“Raúl says Victor’s coffee
could wake a hibernating
bear.”
I glanced at the Benz
parked across the narrow
street. The tinted windows
were so dark I couldn’t see
the man inside. It was a bit
freaky that Raúl had
somehow managed to talk to
Gideon about the coffee I’d
just barely taken over to him
before I even made it back to
the house. “Are you trying to
intimidate me with how
closely you’re watching me?”
“If intimidation were my
goal, I wouldn’t be subtle
about it.”
I picked up the mug I’d
dropped off on the small patio
table prior to making my java
delivery to Raúl. “You do
know that tone of voice
makes me want to irritate you
back, don’t you?”
“Because you like the way
I rise to the challenge,” he
purred, sending little goose
bumps across my skin despite
the warmth of the summer
day.My mouth curved. “So,
what exactly did you guys
end up doing last night?”
“The usual. Drink. Give
each other a hard time.”
“Did you go out?”
“For a couple of hours.”
My grip tightened on the
phone as I pictured a pack of
hot guys out on the prowl. “I
hope you had fun.”
“It wasn’t bad. Tell me
your plans for the day.”
I picked up the same note
of tightness in his words that
I’d just had. Unfortunately,
marriage wasn’t a cure for
jealousy. “When Cary wakes
up and rolls his ass off the
couch, we’ll grab a quick
lunch with my dad. Then
we’re going down to San
Diego to see Dr. Travis.”
“And tonight?”
I took a sip of my coffee,
steeling myself for an
argument. I knew he was
thinking about Brett. “The
band’s manager sent me an email
about where to claim
VIP tickets, but I’ve decided
not to see the show. I figure
Cary can take a friend, if he
wants. What I have to say
won’t take very long, so
either I’ll see Brett tomorrow
before I leave or we can chat
on the phone.”
He exhaled softly. “I
expect you have an idea of
what you’re going to tell
him.”
“I’m gonna keep it simple.
With ‘Golden’ and my
engagement, I don’t think it’s
appropriate for us to see each
other socially. I hope we’ll be
friends and keep in touch, but
e-mail and texts are better,
unless you’re with me.”
He was silent long enough
that I thought maybe the call
had dropped. “Gideon?”
“I need to know if you’re
afraid to see him.”
Uneasy, I took another
drink. The coffee had cooled,
but I barely tasted it anyway.
“I don’t want to fight about
Brett.”
“So your solution is to
avoid him.”
“You and I have enough
shit to fight about without
throwing him into the mix.
He’s not worth it.”
Gideon was quiet again.
This time, I waited him out.
When his voice came
again, it was confident and
decisive. “I can live with that,
Eva.”
My shoulders relaxed and
something inside me eased.
And then, paradoxically, my
chest tightened. I
remembered what he’d said
to me once, that he’d live
with me loving another man
just so long as he had me.
He loved me so much more
than he loved himself. It
broke my heart that he’d sell
himself short like that. It
made it impossible to hold
myself back.
“You’re everything to me,”
I breathed. “I think about you
all the time.”
“It’s no different for me.”
“Really?” I lowered my
voice further, trying to keep it
down. “Because I have it so
bad for you. I get—well, hot.
Like I’m overcome with this
desperate need to be touching
you. My brain scatters and I
have to take a minute to ride
it out, but it’s so hard to deal.
So many times I’ve almost
dropped whatever I’m doing
to get to you.”
“Eva—”
“I have fantasies about
barging into one of your
meetings and just running
right into you. Have I told
you that? When the craving is
really bad, I can almost feel
you pulling at me.”
I rushed on when I heard
him growl softly. “I lose my
breath every time I see you. If
I close my eyes, I can hear
your voice. I woke up this
morning and I panicked a
little because you’re so far
away. I would’ve given
anything to be able to get to
you. I wanted to cry because I
couldn’t.”
“Christ. Eva, please—”
“If you’re going to worry
about anything, Gideon, it
should be me. Because I can’t
be rational when it comes to
you. I’m crazy about you.
Literally. I can’t think about a
future without you—it freaks
me out.”
“Goddamn it. You’ll never
be without me. We’re going
to grow old together. Die
together. I’m not going to live
a single day without you.”
A tear slid from the corner
of my eye. I scrubbed it
away. “I need you to
understand that you’ll never
have to settle for pieces of
me. You shouldn’t be settling
at all. You deserve so much
better. You could have
anyone—”
“That’s enough!”
I jumped at the lash of his
voice.
“You will not ever say
anything like that to me
again,” he snapped. “Or I
swear to God, angel, I will
punish you.”
Shocked silence filled the
space between us. The words
I’d spoken circled restlessly
in my mind, taunting me with
how pathetic I could be. I
never wanted to be dependent
on him, but I already was.
“I have to go,” I said
hoarsely.
“Don’t hang up. For God’s
sake, Eva, we’re married.
We’re in love. There’s no
shame in that. So what if it’s
crazy? It’s us. It’s who we
are. You need to come to
grips with that.”
The screen door squeaked
as my dad stepped onto the
porch. I looked at him and
said, “My dad’s here, Gideon.
I’ll have to talk to you later.”
“You make me happy,” he
said, in the deep firm tone he
used when making an
unswayable decision. “I’d
forgotten what that feels like.
Don’t devalue what you mean
to me.”
God.
“I love you, too.” I ended
the call and set the phone
down on the table with a
shaky hand.
My dad settled into the
other chair with his coffee.
He wore long shorts and a
dark olive T-shirt, but his feet
were bare. He’d shaved and
his hair was still damp, the
ends curling slightly as they
dried.
He was my father, but that
didn’t stop me from
appreciating the fact that he
was ridiculously attractive.
He kept himself in great
shape and had a naturally
confident bearing. I could see
why my mother hadn’t been
able to resist him when they’d
met. And apparently still
couldn’t.
“I heard you talking,” he
said without looking at me.
“Oh.” My stomach
dropped. It was bad enough
spilling my guts to Gideon.
Knowing that my dad had
heard me do it only made it
worse.
“I was going to talk to you
about whether you knew what
you were doing, getting
engaged so soon and so
young.”
I pulled my legs up and
crossed them under me. “I
figured you would.”
“But now I think I
understand what you’re
feeling.” He looked at me, his
gray eyes soft and searching.
“You express it far better than
I ever could, back in the day.
The most I could ever get out
was ‘I love you,’ and it’s just
not enough.”
I could see he was thinking
about my mom. I knew it
must be hard not to when I
looked so much like her.
“Gideon doesn’t think those
words are enough, either.”
I looked down at my rings.
The one Gideon had given me
to express his need to hold on
to me, and the other both a
symbol of his commitment
and a tribute to a time in his
past when he’d last felt loved.
“He shows me, though. All
the time.”
“I’ve talked to him a few
times now.” My dad paused.
“I have to remind myself that
he’s in his twenties.”
That made me smile. “He’s
very self-possessed.”
“He’s also very hard to
read.”
My smile widened. “He’s a
poker player. But he means
what he says.”
I believed Gideon
implicitly. He always told me
the truth. The problem was,
there was a lot he didn’t tell
me.
“And he wants to marry
my daughter.”
I shot him a look. “You
gave him your blessing.”
“He said he would always
take care of you. He promised
to keep you safe and make
you happy.” He stared across
the street at the Benz. “I still
don’t know why I believe
him, even with him staking
out my place for you. Doesn’t
help that he lied about
waiting to ask you.”
“He couldn’t wait, Dad.
Don’t hold it against him. He
loves me too much.”
He looked at me again.
“You didn’t sound happy
when you were just talking to
him.”
“No. I sounded desperate
and insecure.” I sighed. “I
love him like mad, but I hate
when I get needy with it. We
should be balanced in our
relationship. Equals.”
“Good goal. Don’t lose
sight of it. Does he want that,
too?”
“He wants us to be
together. In everything. But
he’s built a reputation and an
empire, and I want to build
my own. Not necessarily the
empire, but the reputation for
sure.”
“Have you talked to him
about this?”
“Oh yeah.” My mouth
quirked. “But he believes
Mrs. Cross should naturally
play on Team Cross. And I
can see his point.”
“It’s good to hear that
you’ve been thinking this
through.”
I heard the pause. “But?”
“But that could be a serious
issue, couldn’t it?”
I loved the way my dad
urged me to explore without
trying to sway me or judge.
He’d always been that way.
“Yes. I don’t think it would
become a deal breaker for us,
but it could cause problems.
He isn’t used to not getting
what he wants.”
“Then you’re good for
him.”
“He thinks so.” I shrugged.
“Gideon isn’t the problem.
It’s me. He’s been through a
lot in his life and he’s had to
deal with it on his own. I
don’t want him to feel like
he’s got to handle everything
himself anymore. I want him
to feel like we’re a unit and
that I’m here to support him.
That’s a hard message to send
when I want my own
independence, too.”
“You’re a lot like me,” he
said with a soft smile, looking
so handsome that my heart
swelled with pride.
“I know you’ll get along
with him. He’s a good man,
with a beautiful heart. He’d
do anything for me, Dad.”
Even kill for me.
The thought made me
queasy. The possibility that
Gideon would have to answer
for Nathan’s death in some
way was all too real. I
couldn’t let anything happen
to him.
“Would he let me pay for
the wedding?” My dad
snorted out a laugh. “I guess I
should ask how much of a
fight you think your mother
would give me.”
“Dad …” My chest
tightened again. After the
discussions we’d had about
paying for my college tuition,
I knew better than to say he
didn’t have to stretch his
finances to the breaking point
for me. It was a point of pride
and my father was a very
proud man. “I don’t know
what to say except thank
you.”
He gave me a relieved
smile and I realized that he’d
been expecting me to be
resistant, too. “I’ve got about
fifty large. I know it’s not
much—”
I reached for his hand. “It’s
perfect.”
I could already hear my
mom’s freakout in my head.
I’d cope with that when the
time came.
It would be worth it for the
look on my father’s face at
that moment.
“IT hasn’t changed.” Cary
paused on the sidewalk
outside the former recreation
center and pulled the
sunglasses off his face. His
gaze slid over the gym’s
entrance. “I’ve missed this
place.”
I reached for his hand and
linked our fingers. “Me, too.”
We headed up the walk and
nodded at the couple standing
by the door smoking. Then
we went inside and were
greeted by the sights and
sounds of a hoops match in
progress. Two teams of three
played a half-court game,
taunting each other and
laughing. I knew from
experience that sometimes
Dr. Travis’s unusual offices
were the only place one felt
free and safe enough to laugh.
We waved at the players,
who paused just long enough
to register us, and then we
made a beeline for the door
that still had Coach
emblazoned on the glass
inset. It was ajar and a
beloved figure lounged in a
worn desk chair with his feet
propped on the desk. He
tossed a tennis ball against
the wall and caught it deftly,
over and over, while a fellow
patient I knew from before
vaped on an electronic
cigarette and talked.
“Oh my God.” Kyle stood
in a rush, her pretty red
mouth falling open and a
cloud of vapor billowing out.
“I didn’t know you two were
back!”
She launched herself at
Cary, barely giving me time
to let his hand go.
Dr. Travis folded his legs
and then stood, his kind face
splitting with a welcoming
grin. He was dressed in his
usual khakis and dress shirt,
with the leather sandals on his
feet and the earrings in his
ears giving him away as a tad
unconventional. His sandy
brown hair was shaggy and
messy, and his wire-rimmed
glasses were slightly skewed
on the bridge of his nose.
“I wasn’t expecting you
two until sometime after
three,” he said.
“It’s after three in New
York,” Cary rejoined,
disentangling himself from
Kyle.
I had my suspicions that
Cary had slept with the pretty
blonde at some point, and that
she hadn’t brushed it off as
easily as he had.
Dr. Travis caught me up in
a quick hug, then did the
same to Cary. I watched my
best friend’s eyes close and
his cheek rest for a moment
on Dr. Travis’s shoulder. My
eyes stung as they always did
whenever I saw Cary happy.
Dr. Travis was the closest
thing to a father that he had
and I knew how much Cary
loved him.
“You two still watching
each other’s backs in the Big
Apple?”
“Of course,” I replied.
Cary jerked his thumb at
me. “She’s getting married.
I’m having a baby.”
Kyle gasped.
I elbowed Cary in the ribs.
“Oww,” he complained,
rubbing his side.
Dr. Travis blinked.
“Congratulations. Quick
work, both of you.”
“I’ll say,” Kyle muttered.
“What’s it been? A month?”
“Kyle.” Dr. Travis tucked
his chair into his desk.
“Would you give us a
minute?”
She snorted and sauntered
toward the door. “You’re
good, Doc, but I think you’re
going to need more time than
that.”
“ENGAGED, huh?” Kyle took
another drag off her ecigarette,
her eyes on Cary as
he leaped above Dr. Travis’s
head and made a slam dunk.
We sat on the worn bleachers
about three rows from the
top, enough distance away
that we couldn’t overhear the
therapy session taking place
on the court.
Cary got restless when he
opened up. Dr. Travis had
quickly learned to keep Cary
physically active if he wanted
to keep him talking.
Kyle looked at me. “I
always kinda figured you and
Cary would end up together.”
I laughed and shook my
head. “It’s not like that with
us. Never has been.”
She shrugged. Her eyes
were the color of the San
Diego sky and heavily
rimmed with electric blue
liner. “You known this guy
you’re marrying long?”
“Long enough.”
Dr. Travis nailed a bank
shot and then ruffled Cary’s
hair affectionately. I saw him
glance at me and knew it was
my turn.
I stood and stretched.
“Catch you later,” I said to
Kyle.
“Good luck.”
My mouth twisted wryly
and I made my way down the
stairs until I reached Dr.
Travis.
He was about Gideon’s
height, so I stopped before I
hit the bottom stair so that we
were briefly at eye level.
“You ever consider moving
to New York, Doc?”
He smiled his crooked
smile. “As if California taxes
aren’t bad enough.”
I sighed dramatically. “I
had to try.”
His arm slung around my
shoulders when I joined him
courtside. “So did Cary. I’m
flattered.”
We went to his office. I
shut the door while he nabbed
a dinged metal chair and spun
it around to sit facing
backward with his arms
draped along the backrest. It
was one of his quirks. He sat
in the desk chair when he was
just hanging out; he straddled
the relic when he got down to
business.
“Tell me about your
fiancé,” he said, when I took
my usual spot on the green
vinyl sofa that was held
together with duct tape and
decorated with signatures of
former and existing patients.
“Come on,” I chided. “We
both know Cary filled you
in.” Cary always started his
sessions with talk about my
life and me. That eventually
dovetailed into talk about
him.
“And I know who Gideon
Cross is.” Dr. Travis tapped
his feet in that way he had
that somehow never seemed
restless or impatient. “But I
want to hear about the man
you’re going to marry.”
I thought for a minute and
he sat quietly while I did, not
waiting, just observing.
“Gideon is … God, he’s so
many things. He’s
complicated. We have some
issues to work out, but we’ll
get there. My more
immediate problem is the
feelings I’m having for this
singer I used to … see.”
“Brett Kline?”
“You remember his name.”
“Cary reminded me, but I
remember our discussions
about him.”
“Yeah, well.” I looked at
my stunning wedding ring,
twisting it around my finger.
“I’m so in love with Gideon.
He’s changed my life in so
many ways. He makes me
feel beautiful and precious. I
know it seems too fast, but
he’s the one for me.”
Dr. Travis smiled. “It was
love at first sight for me and
my wife. We were in high
school when we met, but I
knew she was the girl I was
going to marry.”
My gaze drifted to the
pictures of his wife on his
desk. There was one when
she was younger, and another
more recent. The office itself
was a mess of papers, sports
equipment, books, and
ancient posters of bygone
sports personalities, but the
frames and glass protecting
the photos were spotless.
“I don’t understand why
Brett has any effect on me at
all. It’s not that I want him. I
can’t imagine being with
anyone else but Gideon.
Sexually or otherwise. But
I’m not indifferent to Brett.”
“Why should you be?” he
asked simply. “He was a part
of your life at a pivotal time,
and the end of your
relationship caused a bit of an
epiphany for you.”
“My … interest—that’s not
the right word—doesn’t feel
like nostalgia.”
“No, I’m sure it doesn’t. I
would guess you’re feeling
some regret. Thinking about
what-ifs. It was a highly
sexual relationship for you, so
there may be some lingering
attraction, even if you know
you’d never go there again.”
I was almost sure he was
right about that.
His fingertips drummed on
the back of the chair. “You
said your fiancé is a
complicated man and you’re
working on some issues. Brett
was very simple. You knew
what you were getting with
him. In the last few months,
you’ve had a big move,
you’re closer to your mother,
and you’re engaged. You
may, occasionally, wish
things were simpler.”
I stared at him as that sank
in. “How do you make sense
like that?”
“Practice.”
Fear made me say, “I don’t
want to screw things up with
Gideon.”
“Do you have someone
you’re talking with in New
York?”
“We’re in couples
therapy.”
He nodded. “Practical.
That’s good. He wants it to
work, too. Does he know?”
About Nathan? “Yes.”
“I’m proud of you, kiddo.”
“I’m going to avoid Brett,
but I wonder if that means
I’m not dealing with the root
of the problem. Like an
alcoholic who doesn’t drink
is still an alcoholic. The
problem is still there, they’re
just staying away from it.”
“Not quite true, but
interesting that you’d use an
addiction analogy. You’re
prone to self-destructive
behavior with men. A lot of
individuals with your history
are, so it’s not unexpected
and we’ve addressed that
before.”
“I know.” That was why I
was so afraid of getting lost
in Gideon.
“There are a few things
you have to consider,” he
continued. “You’re engaged
to a man who, on the surface,
is very much the sort of man
your mother would want for
you. Considering how you
feel about your mother’s
dependence on men, there
might be some resistance
you’re feeling.”
My nose wrinkled.
He wagged his finger at
me. “Ah, a possibility? The
other is that you might not
feel you deserve what you’ve
found with him.”
A rock settled in my gut.
“And I deserve Brett?”
“Eva.” He gave me a kind
smile. “The fact you’re even
asking that question … that’s
your problem right there.”

“I DIDN’T EVEN recognize you
without the suit and tie,” Sam
Yimara said, as I settled into
the seat across from him. He
was a compact man, well shy
of six feet in height but
muscled. His head was
shaved and tattooed, his
earlobes pierced so that I
could see right through them.
Pete’s 69th Street Bar
wasn’t located on Sixty-ninth
Street, so I had no idea where
the name originated. I did
understand that Six-Ninths
had derived their name from
it, after playing on its stage
for a number of years. I also
understood that the restrooms
in the back had provided a
place for Brett Kline to screw
my wife.
I wanted to lay my fists
into him for that. She
deserved palaces and private
islands, not seedy bar
bathroom stalls.
Pete’s wasn’t quite a dive,
but it was classless. A beach
bar that looked best under
cover of darkness and known
mostly as a place for SDSU
students to hook up and drink
’til they couldn’t remember
what they did or whom they
fucked.
After I tore the place to the
ground, they wouldn’t
remember the bar, either.
The choice in venue was
deliberate and quite brilliant
on Yimara’s part. It put me
on edge and drove home what
was at stake. If my decision
to show up alone and dressed
in jeans and T-shirt threw him
off in return, I’d consider the
challenge well met.
I leaned back in my seat,
watching him carefully. The
bar had a few patrons, most
of whom were seated on the
patio. Only a handful of us
occupied the beach-themed
interior. “Have you decided
to accept my offer?”
“I’ve considered it.” He
crossed his legs and angled so
that he could lay his arm
along his seat back.
Overconfident and not smart
enough to exercise caution.
“But hey, considering what
you’re valued at, I’m
surprised Eva’s privacy isn’t
worth more than a million
dollars to you.”
I smiled inwardly. “Eva’s
peace of mind is priceless to
me. But if you think I’ll up
my offer, you aren’t thinking
clearly. The injunction
against you will go through.
And then there’s the pesky
little detail regarding the
legality of filming Eva
without her consent, a very
different scenario from a
mutually agreed-upon private
sex tape gone public.”
His jaw tightened. “I
thought you wanted to keep
this quiet, not make it part of
public record. Eva would be
on her own with any lawsuit,
you know. I’ve already talked
to Brett and we’ve worked
things out.”
Tension tightened my
shoulders. “He’s seen the
footage?”
“He has it.” Sam reached
into his pocket and pulled out
a flash drive. “Here’s a copy
for Eva. I figured you should
see what you’re paying for.”
The thought of Kline
viewing sexual images of Eva
sent rage surging through me.
His memories were bad
enough. A recording was
unacceptable.
My hand fisted around the
flash drive. “It’s going to
come out that the footage
exists; I can’t stop it. You
contacted too many reporters
with your offer to sell it.
What I can do is destroy you.
Personally, that would be my
preference. I want to watch
you burn, you piece of shit.”
Sam shifted in his seat.
I leaned forward. “You got
more than Eva and Kline with
your cameras. There are
dozens of other victims who
didn’t sign releases. I own
this bar. Hell, I own the band.
It didn’t take much effort to
find the regulars and Six-
Ninths followers who were
here when you were illegally
filming in the bathrooms.”
The last bit of avarice in
his gaze dimmed, then
blinked out completely.
“If you were smarter,” I
went on, “you would’ve
leveraged for long-term gain
instead of an immediate
payout. Instead, you’re going
to sign the contract I’m about
to put in front of you and
walk away with a check for a
quarter million.”
He straightened. “Fuck
that! You said one million.
That was the deal.”
“Which you didn’t accept.”
I stood. “It’s no longer on the
table. And if you take any
longer to decide, the new
offer won’t be, either. I’ll just
run you into the ground and
straight into a jail cell. It’s
enough that I can tell Eva I
tried.”
As I walked away, I
shoved the flash drive into
my pocket, where it promptly
burned a hole I couldn’t
ignore. My gaze met Arash’s
as I passed where he sat at the
bar waiting for his cue to step
in.
He hopped off his bar
stool. “Always a pleasure
watching you scare the hell
out of someone,” he said,
before heading toward the
seat I’d just vacated, the
necessary contract and check
in hand.
I stepped outside the dim
bar into the bright San Diego
sunshine. Eva didn’t want me
to view the footage; she’d
made me promise I wouldn’t.
But she was feeling
something for Kline. He
remained a very real threat.
Seeing them together,
intimately, might give me the
information I needed to fight
him off.
Had she been as sexually
raw with him as she was with
me? Had she been as
desperate and greedy for
him? Could he make her
come like I could?
I squeezed my eyes shut
against the images in my
head, but they wouldn’t go
away.
Remembering my promise,
I crossed the parking lot to
my rental car.
Is it silly that I’m nearly as excited
to be your “friend” as I am to be
your wife?
I laughed inwardly as I
read Eva’s text and replied.
I’m as excited to be your lover as I
am to be your husband.
OMG … fiend.
That had me laughing
aloud.
“What was that sound?”
Arash looked at me over the
edge of his tablet, having
made himself at home on the
couch in my hotel suite. “Was
that a laugh, Cross? Were you
seriously just laughing? Or
were you having a stroke?”
I flipped him off.
“Seriously?” he shot back.
“The finger?”
“Eva says it’s a classic.”
“Eva’s hot enough to get
away with it. You’re not.”
I opened a new window on
my laptop and logged into my
social media profile, linking it
to Eva’s with the Engaged to
designation now that we were
“friends.” As I waited for her
to accept the relationship link,
I clicked on her profile and
smiled again at the cover
image she’d selected. She
was exposing herself to the
world for the first time, and
she was doing so as the
woman who was mine.
I texted her back when she
approved our joined status.
Now you’re both.
☺ I’m keeping my half of our
deal.
My gaze moved from the
message window to the photo
of us on her profile. I brushed
over her face with my
fingertips, resisting the urge
to go to her. It was too soon.
She needed what space I
could bear to give her.
So am I, angel mine.
THE theater in the casino
wasn’t a huge venue, but it
wasn’t small, either, and it
was easier to fill. It was better
for Six-Ninths to boast soldout
concerts than to risk
embarrassingly empty seats,
even in their hometown.
Christopher would’ve thought
of that.
My brother was good at
what he did. I’d learned not to
tell him so, though. It only
made him more of an asshole.
As the rows of seats slowly
emptied, I made my way
toward backstage. Not my
turf, despite the all-access
pass I carried as primary
shareholder of Vidal Records.
Kline definitely had the
advantage.
But I hadn’t been able to
stay away until morning, even
though I knew it was the
wiser move. Then, he’d be
exhausted. Possibly
hungover. I would have the
upper hand then.
I couldn’t wait that long.
He had the footage. He
would’ve watched it at least
once. Maybe more than that. I
couldn’t stomach the thought
of him watching it again.
Getting it away from him was
the most important thing on
my agenda.
And I wanted him to know
I was close by before he met
with Eva. I was marking my
territory, so to speak, and I
chose to do so in the jeans
and T-shirt I’d worn when I
met Yimara. Anything to do
with Eva was a personal
matter, not business, and I
wanted that to be clear the
moment Kline saw me.
I entered stage left and
walked straight into chaos.
Scantily clad women fucked
up on their drug or booze of
choice lined the scuffed,
narrow corridor. Dozens of
tattooed and pierced men
broke down and packed up
equipment with efficient,
practiced skill and speed.
Hard-grinding music piped
out of hidden speakers,
clashing with the tunes
spilling out of individual
rooms. I weaved through the
pandemonium, searching for
a distinctive head of frosted
spikes.
An achingly familiar
blonde stumbled out of an
open doorway several feet
away, her hair falling around
her shoulders and drawing
attention to the lush curves of
a great ass.
My footsteps slowed. My
heartbeat quickened. Kline
followed her out, a beer in
one hand and the other
reaching for her. She caught
it and pulled him out into the
wing.
I knew how that delicate
hand felt, how smooth the
skin was. How firm the grip. I
knew how those nails felt
digging into my back. How
those fingers tugged at my
hair as she came against my
mouth. The electric sizzle of
her touch. The primal
awareness.
I stood frozen, my gut
knotting. She stood close, too
close, to Kline. Her shoulder
leaned against the wall. Her
hip was cocked
provocatively, her fingertips
brushing suggestively over
Kline’s stomach. He gave her
a cocky, flirtatious smile, his
hand rubbing her upper arm
in a far too intimate way.
No one who saw them
together could mistake that
they were lovers.
Rage fired my blood. A
sick darkness radiated
through me.
Pain. Searing and soul
deep. It took my breath and
every ounce of control.
A woman’s arm draped
over my shoulder. Her hand
slid beneath the neck of my
T-shirt to touch my chest,
while her other wrapped
around my hip to stroke my
dick. Cloying perfume
assaulted my nose, spurring
me to shrug her off violently
even as a model-thin brunette
with heavily made-up blue
eyes tried to sandwich me
from the front.
“Back off!” I growled,
glaring at both in a way that
had them stumbling back and
calling me an asshole.
In another time, I would’ve
fucked them both, turning the
feel of being hunted into one
of complete control.
I’d learned how to handle
sexual predators after Hugh.
How to put them in their
place.
I surged forward, pushing
through the crowd,
remembering the feel of
Kline’s jaw against my fist.
The unforgiving hardness of
his torso. The grunt of air
leaving his body when I hit
him with everything I had.
I wanted him laid out and
battered. Bloody. Broken.
Kline bent over her,
speaking close to her ear. My
hands clenched. She threw
her head back and laughed,
and I stumbled to a halt.
Startled and confused.
Despite the volume of noise,
the sound struck me as
wrong.
It wasn’t Eva’s laugh.
It was too high. My wife’s
laugh was low and throaty.
Sexy. As unique as the
woman it belonged to.
The blonde turned her head
and I saw her in profile. She
wasn’t Eva. The body and
hair were similar. Not the
face.
What the fuck?
My mind caught up with
reality. The girl was the one
from the “Golden” music
video. The Eva stand-in.
Roadies and groupies
filtered around me, but I
remained fixed in place as
Kline caressed and seduced a
pale imitation of my
incomparable wife.
My phone vibrated in my
pocket, startling me. I cursed
and pulled it out, reading the
text from Raúl: She just arrived
at the casino.
So, she’d changed her
mind about seeing Kline.
Working the situation to my
benefit, I typed back: Get her
to the left wing now.
Got it.
I backed up against the
wall, sidestepping into an
alcove half hidden by steel
equipment cases stacked on
hand trucks. The minutes
ticked by slowly.
I sensed her before I saw
her, felt the frisson of
recognition. Turning my
head, I found her easily.
Unlike her imitator, who
wore a small tight dress, Eva
was dressed in jeans that
hugged every curve and a
simple gray tank top. She
wore heeled sandals and hoop
earrings, casual and relaxed.
Hunger hit me with brutal
force. She was the most
beautiful woman I’d ever
seen and easily the sexiest
woman alive. Other women
turned their heads to follow
her when she walked by,
envying her effortless beauty
and sexuality. Men eyed her
with heated interest, but she
didn’t seem to notice, her
attention on Kline.
Her gaze narrowed as she
took in the same scene I had
moments earlier. I watched
her assess the situation and
knew when she reached the
same conclusion I had. A
myriad of emotions crossed
her face. It had to be odd for
her, seeing a former lover so
desperate to recapture what
he’d once had with her.
It was inconceivable to me.
If I couldn’t have Eva, I
would have no one.
Her shoulders went back.
Her chin lifted. Then a smile
curved her mouth. I could see
the acceptance settle over her,
a new kind of peace.
Whatever she’d needed, she
had found it.
Eva passed by without
spotting me, but Raúl joined
me.
“Awkward,” he said, his
attention on Kline as the
singer looked up and spotted
my wife, his body visibly
stiffening.
“Perfect,” I replied, as my
wife greeted Kline by
extending her left hand to
him. My ring on her finger
sparkled brilliantly,
impossible to miss. “Keep me
posted.”
I left.
As my muscles burned
through my eightieth pushup,
my gaze was on the flash
drive lying on the carpet in
front of me. The way I’d dealt
with Yimara and Kline had
been effective but
unsatisfying. I was still tense
and aggravated, spoiling for a
fight.
My eyes stung as rivulets
of sweat ran down my
forehead. My chest heaved
with exertion. Knowing Eva
was out clubbing with Cary
and some of their SoCal
friends only sharpened the
edge I hovered on. I knew
how primed she got when out
drinking and dancing. I loved
nailing her when her body
was damp and steamy with
perspiration, her cunt slick
and greedy.
Jesus. My dick throbbed
and hardened further. My
arms trembled as I neared the
point of muscle fatigue. Veins
stood out in harsh relief along
my forearms and hands. I
needed a cold shower, but I
wouldn’t get myself off. I
always saved it for Eva.
Every thick, creamy drop.
The message app on my
laptop pinged and I slowed
the vicious pace, hitting one
hundred before I pushed to
my feet. I grabbed the flash
drive and dropped it on the
desk, then retrieved the towel
I’d hung over the back of the
chair. Wiping my face before
opening the window on my
laptop, I expected to read the
latest update on Eva’s
evening. What I saw was a
text from her.
What room are you in?
I stared at the screen for a
moment, processing the
question. Another ping
announced a text from Raúl:
She’s heading toward your hotel.
Anticipation shifted my
focus from working out to my
delectable, clever wife. I
typed a reply to her: 4269.
I reached for the phone on
the desk and called room
service. “A bottle of Cristal,”
I ordered. “Two flutes,
strawberries, and whipped
cream. Have it here in ten.
Thanks.”
Returning the receiver to
its base, I slung the towel
around the back of my neck.
A quick glance at the clock
told me it was half past two in
the morning.
By the time the doorbell
chimed, I’d turned on all the
lights in both the living room
and bedroom and opened the
curtains that had been
blocking the view of the
moonlit ocean.
I went to the door and
opened it, finding both Eva
and room service waiting.
Dressed as I’d seen her
earlier, Eva looked like a bad
girl, renewing my hard-on in
an instant. Her hair was limp
and her face shiny, her
mascara running slightly. She
smelled like clean sweat and
alcohol.
If the server hadn’t been
standing behind her, I
would’ve had her on her back
on the foyer tile before she
knew what hit her.
“Holy fuck,” she breathed,
eyeing me from head to toe.
I glanced down. I was still
overheated, my skin shiny
with sweat. The waistband of
my sweats was wet with it,
drawing attention to the
erection I didn’t even try to
will away. “Sorry, you caught
me midworkout.”
“What are you doing in
San Diego?” she demanded
from the hallway.
Stepping back, I gestured
for her to come in.
She didn’t move. “I’m not
getting sucked into your sexgod
vortex until you answer
me.”
“I’m here on business.”
“Bullshit.” Her arms
crossed.
Reaching out, I caught her
by the elbow and tugged her
in. “I can prove it.”
Room service rolled the
cart in after her.
“You’re way too
optimistic,” she muttered,
looking at the order as I
signed the receipt.
I handed the bill and stylus
back, waited for the server to
leave, then walked over to the
phone by the sofa. I dialed
Arash’s room.
“Are you serious?” he
answered, sounding groggy.
“Some of us sleep, Cross.”
“My wife wants to talk to
you.”
“What?” Sheets rustled.
“Where are you?”
“In my room.” I held the
receiver out to Eva. “My
attorney.”
“Are you nuts?” she asked.
“It’s five in the morning in
New York! On a Sunday!”
“He’s in the room next
door. Take it. Ask him if I’ve
been working today.”
She marched over and
snatched the phone out of my
hand. “You should get a new
job,” she told him. “Your
boss is insane.”
He replied and she sighed.
“Before.” She glanced at me.
“Thank God he’s hot. Still, I
might get my head checked.
Sorry he woke you up. Go
back to sleep.”
Eva held the phone out to
me.
I took it and put it to my
ear. “As she said, go back to
sleep.”
“I like her. She gives you
shit.”
My gaze slid over her. “I
like her, too. Good night.”
I hung up and reached for
her.
She backed up, avoiding
my grasp. “Why didn’t you
tell me you were here?”
“Didn’t want to cramp
your style.”
“Don’t you trust me?”
My brows rose. “Asks the
wife who tracked my phone
to my hotel.”
“I was just curious if you
were staying in the penthouse
or not!”
She pouted when I only
continued to eye her. “And …
I missed you.”
“I’m right here, angel.” I
opened my arms to her.
“Come and get me.”
Her nose wrinkled. “I have
to shower. I stink.”
“We’re both sweaty.” I
went to her. This time, she
didn’t pull away. “And I love
the way you smell. You know
that.”
I put my hands on her
waist, sliding them up until I
hugged her delicate rib cage
just beneath the full swell of
her tits. I cupped them
through her top, gently
hefting their weight,
squeezing softly.
I’d never had a fetish for
particular parts of the female
body, until Eva. I worshipped
every inch of her, cherished
all of her generous curves.
The pads of my thumbs
circled her nipples, feeling
them harden. “I love the way
you feel.”
Lowering my head, I found
the crook of her neck and
nuzzled her, rubbing my
damp hair against her.
She moaned. “No fair.
You’re all ripped and shiny
and mostly naked, and I have
no willpower.”
“You don’t need any.” I
pushed my hands beneath her
tank and freed the clasp of
her bra. “Let me have you,
Eva.”
I sucked in a slow, deep
breath as she reached under
the elastic of my waistband
and gripped my cock.
“Yum,” she whispered.
“Look what I found.”
“Angel.” I cupped her ass.
“Tell me you want it exactly
the way I want to give it to
you.”
She looked up at me with
heavy-lidded eyes. “And how
would that be?”
“Here. On the floor. Your
jeans caught around one
ankle, your shirt pushed up,
your underwear shoved to the
side. I want my cock inside
you, my cum filling you.” I
slid my tongue along the
racing pulse in her neck. “I’ll
take care of you once I get
you to bed, but right now … I
just want to use you.”
She trembled. “Gideon.”
Banding one arm behind
her thighs, I pulled her feet
out from under her and
lowered her carefully to the
carpet. My mouth found hers
soft and hot and wet, her
tongue licking mine. Her
arms wrapped around my
neck, trying to hold me. I let
her, my knees straddling her
hips, my fingers opening her
jeans.
Her belly was flat and silky
smooth, concaving with a
giggle when my knuckles
brushed her sides. Her
ticklishness made me smile
into our kiss, joy filling my
chest until it felt too small to
contain it.
“You’ll stay with me,” I
told her. “Wake up with me.”
“Yes.” Her hips lifted to
help me yank her pants down.
I freed one leg and left the
other trapped, my hands
pushing her thighs open so I
could see her. Her panties
were skewed from pulling off
her jeans, giving her just the
look I wanted.
She was my wife. My most
valuable possession; I
treasured her. But I loved her
slutty and dirty, too. A sexual
object for my pleasure. The
one woman who could
silence the memories in my
head and set me free.
“Angel.” I slid down, lying
prone, my mouth watering for
the taste of her.
“No,” she protested, her
hands covering herself.
I pinned her wrists at her
sides and glared. “I want you
like this.”
“Gideon—”
I licked her through the silk
and she arched with a
whimper, her heels digging
into the carpet and lifting her
cunt to my mouth. I pulled
her panties aside with my
teeth and uncovered the
impossibly soft skin. A rough
sound left me, my dick
hardening to the point of
pain.
Wrapping my lips around
her clit, I sucked her, licked
her. Felt her tense up. I
released her hands, knowing
she was mine now, helpless
to fight me.
“Oh God,” she breathed,
writhing. “Your mouth …”
Spreading her wide with
my shoulders, I tongued her,
driving her to come. Her
fingers pulled at my hair,
tugging painfully at the roots,
spurring me on until she
climaxed with a startled cry. I
licked inside her, fucking her,
feeling her quiver around my
tongue. She grew slicker,
hotter.
I rubbed against her clit
and slid two fingers inside
her, grinding my hips into the
floor at the feel of her tight
plushness. My cock ached to
sink into that snug heat,
knowing how amazing it felt,
craving the constriction.
“Please,” Eva begged,
grinding into the thrust of my
fingers, needing the slide of
my dick to fill her.
I wanted to fuck. To come.
Not because I needed sex, but
because I needed her.
Her body twisted and
tensed with another orgasm,
her neck arching as she cried
out. Wiping my wet mouth on
her inner thigh, I rose to my
knees and shoved my sweats
down. I placed one hand on
the floor and used the other to
aim my cock, levering over
her and notching the
throbbing head against her. I
thrust hard, putting the weight
of my body behind it, surging
through the tight clasp with a
groan.
“Gideon.”
“Christ.” I rubbed my
sweat-slick forehead against
her cheek, wanting her to
smell like me. Her nails were
in my back, digging in. I
wanted them to mark me, scar
me. Cupping her ass, I lifted
her, angled her, digging my
feet into the carpet for the
leverage I needed to push all
the way in. Eva gasped and
churned her hips, working to
fit me.
“Take me,” I hissed
through clenched teeth,
fighting the need to come
before she took all of my
cock. “Let me in.”
Her cunt rippled, sucking
at me. I pinned her shoulder
to hold her still and thrust
harder. She gave, letting me
have her.
The feel of her clutching
the entire length of my dick
was all I needed. Wrapping
myself around her, I held her
against me, kissing her
roughly, coming with a
violence that left me
trembling in her arms.
STEAM curled around us as I
cradled Eva in the suite’s
massive sunken tub. Her wet
hair clung to my chest, her
arms draped over mine where
they hugged her waist.
“Ace.”
“Hmm?” I pressed my lips
to her temple.
“If we couldn’t be together
—not that it would ever
happen, just hypothetically—
would you sleep with
someone who looked like
me? I mean, I know I’m not
your usual type, but would
you want to pretend with
someone who reminded you
of me?”
“I’m not going to speculate
on situations that will never
occur.”
“Gideon.” She leaned to
the side, tilting her head back
to look at me. “I get it. I tried
to think if I would find any
comfort in being with
someone similar to you. Like
maybe if it was dark and his
hair was your length—”
My hold tightened. “Eva.
Don’t tell me about fantasies
of other men.”
“God. As usual, you’re not
listening.”
“What the fuck is this
about?” I knew, of course.
But there were no avenues in
the topic I wanted to explore.
“Brett’s sleeping with that
girl from the ‘Golden’ video.
The one who looks like me.”
“No one looks like you.”
She rolled her eyes.
“She may have your
curves,” I conceded, “but she
doesn’t sound like you. She
doesn’t have your sense of
humor, your wit. She doesn’t
have your heart.”
“Oh, Gideon.”
I brushed wet fingertips
over her brow. “Turning off
the lights wouldn’t help me at
all. A random, stacked blonde
wouldn’t smell like you. She
wouldn’t move the way you
do. She wouldn’t touch me
the same way, need me the
same way.”
Her face softened and she
pressed her cheek against my
shoulder. “That’s what I
thought, too. I couldn’t do it.
And the moment I saw Brett
with that girl, I knew that you
wouldn’t do it, either.”
“Not with anyone. Ever.” I
kissed the tip of her nose.
“You’ve changed what sex
means to me, Eva. I couldn’t
go back. I wouldn’t even try.”
She shifted around to
straddle me, sending water
sloshing up and over the rim
of the tub. I looked at her,
taking in the slicked-back
hair the color of wheat, the
smudges left by her makeup,
the sheen of water on her
golden skin.
Her fingers massaged the
nape of my neck. “My dad
wants to pay for the
wedding.”
“Does he now?”
She nodded. “I need you to
be okay with that.”
I was okay with anything
when I had my naked, wet,
and frisky wife wrapped
around me. “I’ve had the
wedding I wanted. You can
do whatever you like this
time around.”
Her brilliant smile and
enthusiastic kiss were all the
reward I needed. “I love
you.”
I pulled her closer.
She bit her lower lip, then
said, “My mom is going to
have a fit. She can blow
through fifty thousand dollars
in just flowers and
invitations.”
“So tell your parents your
dad is paying for the wedding
and your mom can pitch in
for the reception. Problem
solved.”
“Ooh. I like that. You’re
handy to have around, Mr.
Cross.”
I lifted her and licked
across her nipple. “Let me
prove it.”
THE bedroom was lightening
with the coming dawn when
Eva’s breathing settled into
the deep, even rhythm of
sleep. I extricated myself
from both her arms and the
sheets as carefully as
possible, standing beside the
bed to watch her. Her hair
was tumbled around her
shoulders, her lips and cheeks
flushed from sex. I rubbed
my chest, pained by how tight
it had become.
Leaving her like this was
always hard and became
more difficult by the day. My
skin hurt from being parted
from hers.
I closed the curtains in the
bedroom, then moved into the
living room and did the same
there, plunging the room into
darkness.
Then I settled on the sofa
and fell asleep.
A sudden flash of light woke
me. Blinking, I scrubbed at
my gritty eyes and saw that
the curtains had been parted
to send sunlight shafting
across my face. Eva walked
toward me, the light haloing
around her naked body.
“Hey,” she whispered,
sinking to her knees beside
me. “You said I’d wake up
with you.”
“What time is it?” I looked
at my watch, saw I’d only
been asleep an hour and a
half. “You were supposed to
sleep longer.”
She pressed her lips to my
abs. “I don’t sleep well
without you.”
Regret pierced me. My
wife needed things I couldn’t
give her. She woke me with
light instead of a touch
because she feared my
reaction. She was right to be
cautious. In the grip of a
nightmare, the stroke of a
hand might have me waking
up with fists flying.
I brushed her hair back
from her face. “I’m sorry.”
For everything. For all
you’re giving up to be with
me. “Shh.” She lifted the elastic
waistband of my sweats and
pushed it down past my cock.
I was hard for her. How could
I help it when she came to me
naked and sleepy-eyed?
Her mouth wrapped around
the head of my dick.
I squeezed my eyes shut
and groaned, surrendering.
KNOCKING at the door woke
me the next time. Eva stirred
in my arms, cuddled against
me on the narrow stretch of
the sofa.
“Goddamn it,” I muttered,
pulling her tighter against me.
“Ignore it.”
The knocking continued.
I leaned my head back and
yelled, “Go away.”
“I come bearing coffee and
croissants,” Arash shouted
back. “Open up, Cross, it’s
after noon and I want to meet
your lady.”
“Christ.”
Eva blinked up at me.
“Your lawyer?”
“He was.” I sat up and
shoved my hands through my
hair. “We’re going away, you
and me. Soon. Far away.”
She kissed the small of my
back. “Sounds good.”
I shoved my feet into the
legs of my sweats, then stood
to pull them up. Eva took the
opportunity to smack me on
the bare ass.
“I heard that!” Arash
yelled. “Cut it out and open
up.”
“You’re fired,” I told him,
striding toward the door. I
glanced back to tell Eva to
cover herself, but she was
already running into the
bedroom.
I found Arash waiting
outside my suite with a room
service cart. “What the fuck
is the matter with you?”
I had to back out of the
way before he rolled right
through me.
“Quit your bitching.” He
grinned, pushing the cart off
to the side and raking me
with a glance. “Save the
marathon sex for your
honeymoon.”
“Don’t listen to him!” Eva
shouted through the bedroom
door.
“I won’t.” I turned away
from him. “He doesn’t work
for me anymore.”
“You can’t hold it against
me,” Arash said, following
me into the living room.
“Wow. Your back looks like
you got into a brawl with a
mountain lion. No wonder
you’re tired.”
“Shut up.” I snatched my
shirt off the floor.
“You didn’t tell me Eva
was in San Diego, too.”
“It was none of your
business.”
He held up both hands in
surrender. “Truce.”
“Don’t say a word about
Yimara,” I told him quietly.
“I won’t have her worrying
about that.”
Arash sobered. “It’s done. I
won’t mention it again.”
“Good.” I went to the cart
and poured two cups of
coffee, preparing Eva’s the
way she liked it.
“I’ll take a cup,” he said.
“Serve yourself.”
His lips curved wryly as he
joined me. “Is she coming
out?”
I shrugged.
“She’s not mad, is she?”
“I doubt it.” I took both
mugs to the coffee table, then
went to the wall where the
controls for the drapes were.
“It takes some work to piss
her off.”
“You’re good at it.” He
smiled and settled into one of
the armchairs. “I recall that
viral video of you two
scrapping in Bryant Park.”
I shot him a look as
sunlight began pouring into
the room. “You must really
hate your job.”
“Tell me you wouldn’t be
curious if I eloped with a
chick I knew only a couple of
months.”
“I’d send her my
condolences.”
He laughed.
The bedroom door opened
and Eva stepped out dressed
in her clothes from the night
before. Her face was freshly
washed, but the dark circles
under her eyes and her
swollen mouth made her look
both well fucked and
extremely fuckable. With her
bare feet and barely tamed
hair, she was stunning.
Pride swelled my chest.
Uncovered by the lack of
makeup, the dusting of
freckles on her nose made her
adorable. Her body told you
she was a dream to fuck, the
confidence in her posture told
you she’d take no shit from
anyone, and the mischievous
amusement in her eyes told
you there would never be a
dull moment.
She was every promise,
every hope, every fantasy a
man could have. And she was
mine.
I stared. Arash stared, too.
Eva shifted her stance and
smiled shyly. “Hi.”
The sound of her voice
snapped him out of it. He
pushed to his feet so quickly
he spilled his coffee. “Shit.
Sorry. Hi.”
He set his mug down and
brushed the stray droplets off
his pants. He went to her and
held out his hand. “I’m
Arash.”
She shook it. “Nice to meet
you, Arash. I’m Eva.”
I joined them, pushing
Arash back with my forearm.
“Stop drooling.”
He glanced at me. “Funny,
Cross, you ass.”
Eva laughed and leaned
into me when I slid my arm
around her shoulders.
“It’s good to see he works
with people who aren’t afraid
of him,” she said.
Arash winked, blatantly
flirting. “I know how he
operates.”
“Really? I’d love to hear
all about it.”
“I think not,” I drawled.
“Don’t be a spoilsport,
ace.”
“Yeah, ace,” Arash
taunted. “What have you got
to hide?”
I smiled. “Your corpse.”
He looked at my wife and
sighed. “See what I have to
deal with?”

6
A LATE-AFTERNOON OUTDOOR
lunch, in beautiful San Diego,
with the three most important
men in my life definitely
ranked at the top of my bestmoments-
ever list. I sat
between Gideon and my dad,
while Cary lounged in the
seat directly across the table
from me.
If you had asked me a few
months ago, I would have
said I was apathetic about
palm trees. I had a new
appreciation for them now
that I hadn’t seen one in a
while. I watched them sway
gently in the warm ocean
breeze and felt the kind of
peace I chased but rarely
caught. Seagulls competed
with pigeons for the scraps
under tables, while the nottoo-
distant crash of waves
against the beach
underpinned the bustle of the
packed restaurant.
My best friend’s mirrored
shades hid his eyes, but his
smile came often and easy.
My dad wore shorts and a Tshirt
and had started out the
meal unusually quiet. He’d
loosened up after a beer and
now looked as comfortable as
Cary. My husband wore tan
cargo pants and white T-shirt,
the first time I’d ever seen
him in light-colored clothing.
He looked cool and relaxed in
aviators, his fingers linked
with mine on the arm of my
chair.
“An early-evening
wedding,” I thought aloud.
“Around sunset. Just family
and close friends.” I looked at
Cary. “You’ll be the man of
honor, of course.”
His mouth curled up on
one side in a lazy smile. “I
better be.”
I glanced at Gideon. “Do
you know who you’ll ask to
stand with you?”
The tightening of his lips
was nearly imperceptible, but
I caught it. “I haven’t decided
yet.”
My happy mood dimmed a
little. Was he debating
whether Arnoldo would be
suitable, considering the
chef’s feelings toward me? It
made me sad to think I might
strain that relationship.
Gideon was such a private
person. Although I didn’t
know for sure, I suspected he
was tight with his friends but
that there weren’t many of
them.
I squeezed his hand. “I’m
going to ask Ireland to be a
bridesmaid.”
“She’ll like that.”
“What do we do about
Christopher?”
“Nothing. With luck, he
won’t come.”
My dad frowned. “Who are
we talking about?”
“Gideon’s brother and
sister,” I answered.
“You don’t get along with
your brother, Gideon?”
I explained, not wanting
my dad to hold anything
against my husband.
“Christopher’s not a nice
guy.”
Gideon’s head turned
toward me. He didn’t say it
aloud, but I got the message:
He didn’t want me speaking
for him.
“He’s a total douche, you
mean,” Cary interjected. “No
offense, Gideon.”
“None taken.” He shrugged
and then elaborated for my
father. “Christopher views me
as a competitor. I’d have it
differently, but it’s not my
choice.”
My dad nodded slowly.
“That’s too bad.”
“While we’re discussing
the wedding,” Gideon segued
smoothly, “it would be my
pleasure to provide
transportation. It would give
me a chance to contribute,
which I’d appreciate.”
I took a deep breath,
understanding—as I knew my
father would—that my
husband’s directness and tact
made him hard to refuse.
“That’s very generous of
you, Gideon.”
“It’s a standing offer. With
an hour’s notice, we can have
you in the air and on your
way. It’ll make it easier for
you and Eva to work around
your schedules and maximize
your time together.”
My dad didn’t answer right
away. “Thank you. It might
take me a while to get used to
the idea. It’s a bit
extravagant, and I don’t want
to be a burden.”
Gideon pulled his shades
off, baring his eyes. “That’s
what money’s for. All I want
is to make your daughter
happy. Make that easy on me,
Mr. Reyes. We all want to see
Eva smiling as much as
possible.”
It sank in then why my dad
was so opposed to Stanton
paying for anything. My
stepdad didn’t do it for me;
he did it for my mom. Gideon
would only ever consider me
when making decisions. I
knew my dad could live with
that.
I caught Gideon’s gaze and
mouthed, I love you.
His grip on my hand
tightened until it hurt. I didn’t
mind.
My dad smiled. “Making
Eva happy. How can I argue
with that?”
THE smell of freshly brewed
coffee brought my welltrained
senses to life the
following morning. I blinked
up at the bedroom ceiling of
my Upper West Side
apartment and gave a sleepy
smile when I discovered
Gideon standing beside my
bed, stripping out of his shirt.
The sight of his leanly
muscular torso and
washboard abs almost made
up for the fact that I’d
obviously spent the night
alone after falling asleep in
his arms.
“Good morning,” I
murmured, rolling onto my
side as he pushed his pajama
bottoms down and kicked
them off.
Whoever said Mondays
sucked had obviously never
woken up to a naked Gideon
Cross.
“It will be,” he said, lifting
the covers and sliding
between the sheets with me.
I shivered as his cool skin
touched mine. “Yikes!”
His arms slipped around
me, and his lips touched my
neck. “Warm me up, angel.”
By the time I was done
with him he was sweating and
the coffee he’d brought me
was cold.
I didn’t mind in the least.
I was in an excellent mood
when I got to work. Morning
sex contributed to that, of
course. Also the sight of
Gideon getting dressed for
the day, watching him
transform from the private
man I knew and loved into
the dark and dangerous global
magnate. The day only got
better when I exited on the
twentieth floor and saw
Megumi sitting at her desk.
I waved at her through the
glass security doors, but my
smile faded the moment I got
a good look at her. She was
pale and had dark circles
under her eyes. Her usually
sassy asymmetrical haircut
looked limp and overlong,
and she was wearing a longsleeved
blouse and dark
slacks that were out of place
with the August mugginess.
“Hey,” I greeted her when
she buzzed me through.
“How are you? I’ve been
worried about you.”
She gave me a weak smile.
“I’m sorry I didn’t call you
back.”
“Don’t worry about it. I’m
totally antisocial when I get
sick. I just want to curl up in
bed and be left alone.”
Her lower lip quivered and
her eyes grew shiny with
tears.
“Are you okay?” I glanced
around, worried about her
privacy as other employees
passed through the reception
area. “Did you see a doctor?”
She started crying.
Horrified, I stood frozen
for a minute. “Megumi.
What’s wrong?”
She pulled off her headset
and stood, tears spilling down
her face. She shook her head
violently. “I can’t talk about
it now.”
“When is your break?”
But she was already
hurrying to the bathroom,
leaving me staring after her.
I headed to my cubicle and
dropped off my bag, then
went down the hall to Will
Granger’s desk. He wasn’t
there, but I found him in the
break room when I stopped to
grab some coffee.
“Hey, you.” His eyes
behind his square-framed
glasses looked as worried as I
felt. “Did you see Megumi?”
“Yeah. She looks wiped
out. And she started crying
when I asked how she’s
doing.”
He slid the carton of halfand-
half over to me. “Not
good, whatever it is.”
“I’m bad with not
knowing. My imagination
runs wild. I’m bouncing
between cancer, pregnancy,
and everything in between.”
Will shrugged helplessly.
With his neatly trimmed
sideburns and subtly quirkypatterned
shirts, he was the
sort of affable and easynatured
guy who was hard to
dislike.
“Eva.” Mark stuck his head
in the door. “I’ve got news.”
My boss’s bright eyes told
me he was excited about
something. “I’m all ears.
Coffee?”
“Sure. Thanks. See you in
my office.” He ducked back
out again.
Will grabbed his mug off
the counter. “Have a good
one.”
He left. I hurried to get the
coffee ready, then went to
Mark’s office. He’d taken his
jacket off and was studying
something on his monitor. He
looked up, smiling when he
saw me.
“We’ve got a new RFP
request.” His smile widened.
“And they asked for me
specifically.”
I tensed. Setting his coffee
down, I asked warily, “Is it
another Cross Industries
product?”
As much as I loved Gideon
and admired all that he’d
accomplished, I didn’t want
to be totally overshadowed by
his world. Part of who we
were as a couple was two
people who had separate
working lives. I enjoyed
riding to work with my
husband, but I needed to say
good-bye to him, too. I
needed those few hours when
he didn’t consume me.
“No, it’s bigger.”
My brows rose. I couldn’t
think of anything or anyone
bigger than Cross Industries.
Mark slid a picture of a
silver-and-red box across the
desk to me. “It’s the new
PhazeOne gaming system
from LanCorp.”
I settled into the seat in
front of his desk with an inner
sigh of relief. “Sweet. Sounds
fun.”
IT was a little after eleven
when Megumi called to see if
I was free for lunch.
“Of course,” I told her.
“Someplace quiet.”
I considered our options.
“I’ve got an idea. Leave it to
me.”
“Great. Thanks.”
I sat at my desk. “How’s
your morning been?”
“Busy. I have to get caught
up.”
“Let me know if I can help
with anything.”
“Thank you, Eva.” She
took a deep, shaky breath, her
composure slipping. “I
appreciate you.”
We hung up. I called
Gideon’s office, and his
secretary answered.
“Hey, Scott. It’s Eva. How
are you?”
“I’m good.” I could hear
the smile in his voice. “What
can I do for you?”
My feet tapped restlessly. I
couldn’t help but be worried
about my friend. “Could you
ask Gideon to give me a call
when he has a free minute?”
“I’ll put you through now.”
“Oh. Okay, great. Thanks.”
“Hang on.”
A moment later I heard the
voice I loved. “What do you
need, Eva?”
I was startled for a minute
by his brusqueness. “Are you
busy?”
“I’m in a meeting.”
Fuck. “My bad. Bye.”
“Eva—”
I hung up, and then called
Scott again to discuss how we
should handle calls in the
future so I didn’t come out
looking like an ass. Before he
answered, the secondary line
flashed with an incoming call.
I switched over. “Mark
Garrity’s office—”
“Don’t ever hang up on
me,” Gideon snapped.
I bristled at his tone. “Are
you in a meeting or not?”
“I was. Now I’m dealing
with you.”
Hell if anyone was going to
“deal” with me. I could be as
pissy as him any day of the
week. “You know, I asked
Scott to give you a message
when you had time for it and
he patched me through. He
shouldn’t have done that, if
you were busy with—”
“He has standing orders to
always connect your calls. If
you want to leave me a
message, send a text or an email.”
“Well, excuse me for not
knowing the etiquette for
getting in touch with you!”
“Never mind that now. Say
what you need.”
“Nothing. Forget it.”
He exhaled roughly.
“Don’t play games with me,
angel.”
I was reminded of the last
time I’d called him at work
and how off he’d sounded
then, too. If something was
bugging him, he sure wasn’t
sharing it.
I hunched over my desk
and lowered my voice.
“Gideon, your attitude pisses
me off. I don’t want to deal
with you when you’re
aggravated. If you’re too busy
to talk to me, you shouldn’t
have standing orders that
interrupt you.”
“I’m never going to be
unreachable.”
“Really? ’Cause you seem
that way right now.”
“For fuck’s sake.”
Hearing his exasperation
gave me a surge of
satisfaction. “I didn’t text you
because I didn’t want to
bother you in a meeting. I
didn’t send an e-mail,
because it’s a time-sensitive
favor and I don’t know how
often you get to your inbox. I
figured a message with Scott
would get the job done best.”
“And now you have my
complete attention. Tell me
what you want.”
“I want to get off the
phone, and I want you to get
back to your meeting.”
“What you’re going to
get,” he said, with dangerous
evenness, “is me at your desk
if you don’t cut the shit and
explain why you called.”
I glared at his photo. “You
make me want to find a job in
New Jersey.”
“You make me crazy.” He
growled softly. “I can’t
function when we’re fighting,
you know that. Just say what
you need, Eva, and forgive
me for now. We can argue
and have makeup sex later.”
The tension left me. How
could I stay mad at him after
he admitted how vulnerable I
could make him?
“Damn you,” I muttered. “I
hate when you get reasonable
after irritating me.”
He made a low sound of
reluctant amusement. I
instantly felt better.
“Angel mine.” His voice
took on the sexy, raspy
warmth I needed to hear.
“Definitely not a quiet,
comfortable ornament.”
“What are you talking
about?”
“Don’t worry about it.
You’re perfect. Tell me why
you called.”
I knew that tone. I’d turned
him on somehow. “You’re a
maniac. Seriously.”
Lucky me.
“Anyway, ace, I wanted to
see if I could borrow one of
your conference rooms for
lunch with Megumi. She’s
back, but she’s a mess and I
think she wants to talk about
it but there’s really not a good
place to go nearby that’s
private and quiet.”
“Use my office. I’ll have
something ordered in and
you’ll have the space to
yourself while I’m out.”
“For real?”
“Of course. However, I
have to remind you that when
you work for Cross Industries
you’ll have your own office
to lunch in.”
My head fell back. “Shut
up.”
THE research involved in
prepping for the PhazeOne
RFP kept me hopping, but I
was antsy for information
from Megumi, so the hour
seemed to drag anyway.
I met up with her at the
reception desk at noon. “If
it’s not too weird,” I said, as
she pulled her purse out of a
drawer, “we’re going to use
Gideon’s office for lunch.
He’s out and it’s private.”
“Oh man.” She shot me an
apologetic look. “I’m sorry,
Eva. I should’ve
congratulated you. Will told
me about your engagement,
but I spaced.”
“It’s totally okay. Don’t
worry about it.”
She reached out and
squeezed my hand. “I’m
really happy for you.”
“Thank you.”
My concern deepened.
Megumi always followed the
latest gossip. The friend I
knew would’ve heard about
the engagement almost before
I did.
We took an elevator to the
top floor. The Cross
Industries vestibule was as
striking as Gideon himself. It
was much bigger than others
in the building and decorated
with lilies and ferns in
hanging baskets. CROSS
INDUSTRIES was etched into
the smoked-glass security
doors in a masculine but
elegant font.
“Impressive,” Megumi
murmured, as we waited for
the receptionist to buzz us
through.
The redhead I was used to
seeing at the reception desk
must have been out to lunch,
because a guy with dark hair
let us in.
He stood when we
approached. “Good
afternoon, Miss Tramell.
Scott said you should just go
right in.”
“Has Mr. Cross left?”
“I’m not sure. I just took
over here.”
“All right. Thank you.” I
led Megumi back. We
rounded the corner to reach
Gideon’s office just in time to
see him stepping out.
Fierce pride and possession
moved me. Pleasure, too,
when his stride faltered just a
bit when he saw me. We met
each other halfway.
“Hi,” I greeted him.
He gave me a nod in return
and held his hand out to
Megumi. “I don’t think we’ve
been officially introduced.
Gideon Cross.”
“Megumi Kaba.” She gave
him a firm shake.
“Congratulations to you and
Eva.”
A ghost of a smile touched
his sexy mouth. “I’m a lucky
man. Make yourselves
comfortable. If you need
anything, just call up to
reception and Ron will see to
it.”
“We’ll be fine,” I told him.
“You won’t even know we
had a raging party in there
while you’re gone.”
He smiled outright. “Good.
I have a meeting later. Shot
glasses and streamers would
be interesting to explain.”
I expected him to head out.
Instead, he cupped my face,
tilted my head to the angle he
wanted, and pressed his lips
to mine in an unhurried,
chaste kiss that left me with
little stars in my eyes.
Then he whispered in my
ear, “Looking forward to
making up later.”
My toes curled.
Pulling back, he slid easily
into the reserved persona he
showed the rest of the world.
“Enjoy your lunch, ladies.”
He walked away with the
confident, innately sexual
stride that turned heads.
“And you’re still standing
upright,” Megumi murmured,
shaking her head. “Kills me.”
I couldn’t explain how
weak Gideon made me. How
shaken and needy I could so
easily become. “Come on,” I
said breathlessly. “Let’s eat.”
She followed me into
Gideon’s office. “I don’t
think I can.”
While she took in the
sprawling space with its
panoramic views and
monochromatic color scheme,
I went to the bar, where lunch
awaited us. I remembered
how I’d felt the first time I
walked into the room. Despite
the multiple seating areas that
might have invited guests to
sit and stay awhile, the
progressively contemporary,
cutting-edge design kept
visitors from getting too
comfortable.
There were so many sides
to the man I’d married. His
office reflected only one. The
classically European style of
his penthouse reflected
another.
“Have you ever
experimented with BDSM?”
Megumi asked, seizing my
attention.
Surprise made me drop the
napkin-rolled utensils I’d
been holding. I spun to face
her and found her staring out
the window at the city. “That
acronym covers a lot of
ground.”
She rubbed her wrist.
“Being tied up and gagged.
Helpless.”
“I’ve been helpless, yes.”
Her head turned. Her eyes
were twin shadows in her
pale face. “Did you like it?
Did it turn you on?”
“No.” I walked over to the
nearest couch and sat. “But I
wasn’t with the right person.”
“Were you scared?”
“Terrified.”
“Did he know that?”
The formerly appetizing
smell of lunch started to turn
my stomach. “Why are you
asking me these questions,
Megumi?”
She answered by rolling up
her sleeve, exposing a wrist
so bruised it was nearly
black.

IT WAS AFTER eight when I let
myself into Eva’s apartment
and found her sitting with
Cary on the living room’s
white sectional sofa, holding
a glass of red wine in both
hands.
My wife gravitated toward
modern traditional
furnishings, but I could see
touches of her mother and
roommate in the décor. I
didn’t resent those pieces of
Monica and Cary, but I
looked forward to the day
when I shared a home with
Eva that reflected us,
undiluted.
Still, the apartment would
always be a special place to
me. I would never forget the
way Eva had looked the first
time I’d come over. Naked
beneath a thigh-length silk
robe, her face made up for the
night ahead, a diamond anklet
winking at me. Teasing me.
I had lost all rational
thought. I’d put my mouth on
her, my hands all over her,
and my fingers and tongue
inside her. I hadn’t even
thought about getting her to
the “fuck pad.” I wouldn’t
have been able to wait, even
if I had. She wasn’t like any
woman who’d come before
her. Not just because of who
she was, but also because of
who I was when I was with
her.
It was unlikely I would
ever allow the property
management to lease the
space out again. It held too
many memories, both good
and bad.
I tipped my chin at Cary in
greeting and sat beside Eva.
My wife’s best friend was
dressed to go out, while Eva
wore a Cross Industries Tshirt
and had her hair twisted
up in a clip. They both
glanced at me, and I knew
something was wrong.
There were things to
discuss, but whatever was
troubling Eva was the
pressing priority.
Cary stood. “I’m heading
out. Call me if you need me.”
She nodded. “Have fun.”
“My middle name, baby
girl.”
The front door shut behind
him as Eva’s head fell gently
against my shoulder. Sliding
my arm around her, I settled
deeper into the sofa and
tucked her closer. “Talk to
me, angel.”
“It’s Megumi.” She sighed.
“There’s this guy she was
into and things weren’t
working out—he was hotand-
cold and couldn’t commit
—so she broke it off. But
afterward, he stepped it up
and she let him come over.
They started messing around
with a little bondage, but
things got out of hand in a
bad way.”
The mention of bondage
put me on alert. I ran my
hand down her back and
tucked her tighter against me.
I was nothing if not patient in
aligning my desires with her
fears. Setbacks were expected
and accommodated, but I
didn’t want someone else’s
misadventures to create new
hurdles for Eva and me to
face.
“Sounds like bad judgment
all around,” I said. “One of
them should’ve known what
they were doing.”
“That’s the thing.” She
pulled away and faced me. “I
went over it with Megumi.
She said no—a lot—until he
gagged her. He got off on her
pain, Gideon. And now he’s
terrorizing her with texts and
photos he took of her that
night. She’s asked him to
stop, but he won’t. He’s sick.
Something’s wrong with
him.”
I weighed how best to
respond. I went with blunt.
“Eva. She broke it off, and
then took him back. He might
not realize she’s serious this
time.”
She recoiled, then slid off
the couch in a rush of curvy,
golden legs. “Don’t make
excuses for him! She’s
bruised everywhere. It’s been
a week and the bruises are
still dark. She couldn’t sit
down for days!”
“I’m not excusing him.” I
stood with her. “I would
never justify an abuser—you
know that. I don’t have the
whole story, but I know your
story. Her situation isn’t like
yours. Nathan was an
aberration.”
“I’m not projecting here,
Gideon. I saw the pictures. I
saw her wrists, her neck. I
saw his texts. He’s crossed a
line. He’s dangerous.”
“Even more reason for you
to stay out of it.”
Her hands went to her hips.
“Oh my God. You did not
just say that! She’s my
friend.”
“And you’re my wife. I
know that look on your face.
There are some battles that
aren’t yours to fight. You will
not confront this man the way
you did my mother and
Corinne. You will not put
yourself in the middle of
this.”
“Did I say I was going to
do that? No, I didn’t. I’m not
an idiot. I asked Clancy to
find him and talk to him.”
I went still inside.
Benjamin Clancy was her
stepfather’s man, not mine.
Totally outside my control.
“You shouldn’t have done
that.”
“What was I supposed to
do instead? Nothing?”
“Preferably. At most, you
should’ve asked Raúl.”
She threw up her hands.
“Why would I do that? I
don’t know Raúl enough to
ask him for a personal favor.”
I checked my exasperation.
“We discussed this. He works
for you. You don’t have to
ask him for favors, you just
need to tell him what you
need done.”
“Raúl works for you.
Besides, I’m not some
godfather sending out hired
thugs to teach people lessons.
I asked someone I trust, as a
friend, to help another friend
of mine.”
“However you rationalize
it, the result is the same. You
forget, Ben Clancy is
employed to protect your
stepfather’s interests. He
looks after you only because
it gives him more control in
securing Stanton’s safety and
reputation.”
She bristled. “How would
you know what his motives
are?”
“Angel, let’s simplify.
Focus on the fact that your
mother and Stanton have
been invading your privacy
for some time. You’re
keeping that door open by
using their resources.”
“Oh.” Eva caught her
lower lip in her teeth. “I
hadn’t thought of it that
way.”
“You sent a trained
professional to ‘talk’ to this
guy. But you didn’t fully
assess the possibility of
blowback. If you’d tapped
Raúl to help you, he
would’ve known to be extra
vigilant.” My jaw clenched.
“Damn it, Eva. Don’t make it
hard for me to keep you
safe!”
“Hey.” She reached for me.
“Don’t worry, okay? I told
you what was happening as
soon as you walked in the
door. And Clancy was with
me until an hour ago, when
he dropped me off after my
Krav Maga class. Nothing’s
happened yet that would put
me in danger.”
I pulled her into me and
held on, wishing I could be
certain she was right. “I want
Raúl to escort you wherever
you go,” I said gruffly. “To
your classes, the gym,
shopping … whatever. You
need to let me look after
you.”
“You do, baby,” she said
soothingly, her temper
cooled. “But you can be
obsessive about it.”
I would always be
obsessive when it came to
her. I’d come to accept that.
Eventually, she would, too.
“There are things I can’t give
you. Don’t fight me on the
things I can.”
“Gideon.” Her face
softened. “You give me
everything I need.”
I brushed my fingers across
her jaw. She was so soft.
Delicate. I had never
anticipated my sanity hinging
on something so fragile. “You
come home to another guy.
You make your living by
working for someone else.
I’m not as necessary to you as
I’d like to be.”
Her eyes brightened with
humor. “While I’m about as
dependent on you as I can
stand to be.”
“It’s mutual.” Running my
hands down her arms, I
caught her by the wrists and
squeezed with just enough
pressure to capture her focus.
I watched her pupils dilate
and her lips part, her body
instinctively responding to
the restraint. “Promise you’ll
come to me first from now
on.”
“Okay,” she breathed.
The undercurrents of
arousal and surrender in her
voice sent my blood
humming. She swayed into
me, her body softening. “I’d
like to come now, actually.”
“I am, as always, at your
service.”
GIDEON.
The shock of hearing panic
in Eva’s voice reverberated
through me. My body jolted,
jerking me out of the deepest
sleep. Rolling to my side with
a low moan, I struggled
awake, shoving my hair out
of my face to find her
kneeling on the edge of the
bed.A heavy, inescapable sense
of dread had my heart racing
and cold sweat coating my
skin.
I pushed up onto one
elbow. “What’s wrong?”
Moonlight slanted through
the room and haloed her.
She’d come to me in our
bedroom in the apartment
next door to hers. Something
had woken her, and I was
afraid. Fear chilled me to the
bone.
“Gideon.” She slid into me
in a rush of silken skin and
shining hair. Curled against
me, she reached up and
touched my face. “What were
you dreaming about?”
The stroke of her fingertips
left a trail of wet across my
skin. Startled, horrified, I
scrubbed at my eyes and
smeared more tears across my
cheek. In a corner of my
mind, I sensed the lingering
shadow of a dream.
The brush of memory had
me shivering, spiraling
further downward.
I rolled into her and pulled
her tight against me, hearing
her gasp as I squeezed too
hard. Her skin was cool to the
touch, but her flesh was warm
beneath and I absorbed her
heat, breathed in her scent,
felt the terrible lingering grief
inside me ease with her
nearness.
I couldn’t grasp the dream
I’d had, but it refused to let
go of me.
“Shh,” she crooned, her
fingers pushing through the
sweat-damp roots of my hair,
her hand stroking up and
down my back. “It’s okay.
I’m here.”
I couldn’t breathe. I fought
for air and a horrible sound
ripped from my burning
lungs.
A sob. Christ. Then
another. I couldn’t stop the
violent contractions.
“Baby.” She hugged me
harder, her legs tangling with
mine. She rocked us gently,
whispering words I couldn’t
hear over the pounding of my
heartbeat and the outcry of
my phantom pain.
I wrapped myself around
her, holding on to the love
that could save me.
“GIDEON!”
Eva’s back arched as I
thrust hard, my knees
spreading her thighs wide, my
cock tunneling deep. Her
wrists were pinned by my
hands, her head thrashing as I
fucked her hard.
Some days I woke her with
tenderness. Today wasn’t one
of those mornings.
I’d woken to a throbbing
erection, the head of my dick
wet with pre-cum against the
curve of Eva’s ass. I aroused
her hungrily, impatiently,
sucking her nipples to hard
points, slickening her cunt
with the demanding drive of
my fingers. She’d ignited to
my touch, gave herself over
to me, gave herself to me.
God. I loved her so much.
The need to come was like
a vise around my balls, the
pressure exquisite. She was
tight, so amazingly snug, and
so wet. I couldn’t get enough.
Couldn’t get deep enough,
even when I felt the end of
her clasping at the head of my
cock.
She thrashed beneath my
pounding drives, her heels
sliding across the sheets, her
tits rocking with the force of
my thrusts. She was so small,
so soft, and I was fucking her
lush body with everything I
had in me.
Take me. Take all of me.
The good and the bad.
Everything. Take it all.
The headboard banged into
the shared wall between our
two apartments in a harddriving
rhythm that screamed
crazed sex to anyone
listening. As did the growls
spilling from my throat, the
animalistic sounds of my
pleasure I didn’t try to hold
back. I loved fucking my
wife. Craved it. Needed it.
And I didn’t care who knew
what she did to me.
Eva arched up, sinking her
teeth into my biceps, her bite
sliding over my sweat-slick
skin. The mark of possession
drove me wild, had me
thrusting so hard I shoved her
up the bed.
She cried out. I hissed as
she tightened around me like
a greedy fist.
“Come,” I bit out, my jaw
clenched against the urge to
do the same, to let go and
pump every drop I had into
her. Rolling my hips, I ground
against her clit, pleasure
sizzling up my spine when
she moaned my name and
climaxed around me in
pulsing ripples.
I kissed her roughly,
drinking in her taste, spilling
into her with a shuddering
groan.
EVA stumbled a little as I
helped her out of the back of
the Bentley in front of the
Crossfire.
A hot flush spread across
her face and she shot me a
look. “You suck.”
My brows rose
questioningly.
“I’m shaky and you’re not,
sex machine.”
I smiled innocently. “I’m
sorry.”
“No, you’re not.” Her wry
smile faded as she glanced
down the street. “Paparazzi,”
she said grimly.
I followed her gaze and
spotted the photographer
aiming a camera out of the
open passenger window of
his car. Gripping her by the
elbow, I led her into the
building.
“If I have to start actually
styling my hair every day,”
she muttered, “you’re dealing
with morning wood on your
own.”
“Angel,” I tugged her into
my side and whispered, “I’d
hire a full-time hairdresser for
you before I gave up your
cunt every morning.”
She elbowed me in the
ribs. “God, you’re crude, you
know that? Some women take
offense to that word.”
She went ahead of me
through the security turnstiles
and joined the mass of bodies
waiting for the next elevator
car.
I stood close behind her.
“You’re not one of them.
However, I might be willing
to revise. I recall orifice being
a favorite of yours.”
“Oh God. Shut up,” she
said, laughing.
We separated when she
exited on the twentieth floor
and I went up to Cross
Industries without her. I
wouldn’t be doing so for
long. Someday, Eva would be
working with me, helping to
build our future as a team.
I was debating the myriad
avenues to achieving that
goal when I rounded the
corner on approach to my
office. My stride slowed
when I saw the willowy
brunette waiting by Scott’s
desk.
I steeled myself to deal
with my mother again.
Then her head turned and I
saw it was Corinne.
“Gideon.” She rose
gracefully to her feet, her
eyes brightening with a look
I’d come to recognize, having
seen it on Eva’s face.
It gave me no pleasure to
see that warmth in Corinne’s
eyes. Unease slid down my
spine, stiffening my back.
The last time I had seen her
had been shortly after she’d
tried to kill herself.
“Good morning, Corinne.
How are you feeling?”
“Better.” She came toward
me and I took a step back,
causing her to slow and her
smile to waver. “Do you have
a moment?”
I gestured to my office.
With a deep breath, she
turned and preceded me. I
glanced at Scott. “Give us
ten.”
He nodded, his gaze
sympathetic.
Corinne walked to my desk
and I joined her, hitting the
button that closed the door
behind us. I kept the glass
clear and didn’t remove my
jacket, sending her every
signal that she shouldn’t
settle in for long.
“I’m sorry for your loss,
Corinne.” Saying the words
wasn’t enough, but they were
all I could give her. The
memories of that night in the
hospital would be with me for
a while.
Her lips whitened. “I still
can’t believe it. All these
years of trying … I thought I
couldn’t get pregnant.” She
picked up the photo of Eva on
my desk. “Jean-François told
me you called a couple times
asking about me. I wish
you’d called me. Or returned
my calls.”
“I don’t think that’s
appropriate, under the
circumstances.”
She looked at me. Her eyes
weren’t the same shade of
blue as my mother’s, but they
were close, and their sense of
style was similar. Corinne’s
elegant blouse and trousers
were notably like something
I’d once seen my mother
wear.
“You’re getting married,”
Corinne said.
It wasn’t a question, but I
answered anyway. “Yes.”
Her eyes closed. “I’d
hoped Eva was lying.”
“I’m very protective when
it comes to her. Tread
lightly.”
Opening her eyes, she set
the picture down hard. “Do
you love her?”
“That’s none of your
business.”
“That’s not an answer.”
“I don’t owe you one, but
if you need to hear it, she’s
everything to me.”
The tightness of her mouth
softened with a quiver.
“Would it make a difference
if I told you I’m getting
divorced?”
“No.” I exhaled roughly.
“You and I will never be
together again, Corinne. I
don’t know how many times
or in how many ways I can
say it. I could never be what
you want me to be. You
dodged a bullet when you
broke our engagement.”
She flinched, her hair
sliding over her shoulder to
flow down to her waist. “Is
that what’s keeping us apart?
You can’t forgive me for
that?”
“Forgive you? I’m
thankful.” My voice softened
when tears filled her eyes. “I
don’t mean to be cruel. I can
guess how painful this might
be. But I didn’t want you to
have hope when there isn’t
any.”
“What would you do if Eva
said these things to you?” she
challenged. “Would you just
give up and walk away?”
“It’s not the same.” I raked
a hand through my hair,
struggling to find the words.
“You don’t understand what I
have with Eva. She needs me
as much as I need her. For
both our sakes, I wouldn’t
ever give up trying.”
“I need you, Gideon.”
Frustration made me curt.
“You don’t know me. I
played a role for you. I let
you see only what I wanted
you to see, what I thought
you could accept.” And in
return, I saw only what I
wanted to see in her, the girl
she’d once been. I had
stopped paying real attention
long ago, and so I’d failed to
see how she had changed.
She’d been a blind spot for
me, but no longer.
She stared at me in
shocked silence for a
moment. “Elizabeth warned
me that Eva was rewriting
your past. I didn’t believe her.
I’ve never known you to be
swayed by anyone, but I
guess there’s a first time for
everything.”
“My mother believes what
she wants and you’re
welcome to join her.” They
were similar in that way, too.
Good at believing what they
wanted and ignoring any
proof to the contrary.
It was a revelation to
realize I had been
comfortable with Corinne
because I’d known she
wouldn’t pry. I’d been able to
fake normalcy with her and
she never dug deeper. Eva
had changed that for me. I
wasn’t normal and I didn’t
need to be. Eva accepted me
the way I was.
I wasn’t going to reveal my
past to everyone, but my days
of playing along with the lies
were over.
Corinne reached a hand out
to me. “I love you, Gideon.
You used to love me, too.”
“I was grateful to you,” I
corrected. “And I will always
be. I was attracted to you, had
fun with you, for a time I
even needed you, but it would
never have worked out
between us.”
She dropped her hand back
to her side.
“I would have found Eva
eventually. And I would’ve
wanted her, given up
everything to have her. I
would have left you to be
with her. The end was
inevitable.”
Corinne turned away.
“Well … at least we’ll always
be friends.”
It was an effort to strip any
apology out of my tone. I
wouldn’t encourage her.
“That won’t be possible. This
is the last time you and I will
speak to each other.”
Her shoulders shook with a
ragged indrawn breath, and I
turned my head, fighting with
discomfort and regret. She’d
been important to me once. I
would miss her, but not in the
way she wanted me to.
“What do I have to live for
if I don’t have you?”
I turned at her question and
barely caught her when she
ran into me, holding her at
bay with a grip on her upper
arms.
The devastation on her
beautiful face got to me
before I could process what
she’d said. Then it registered.
Horrified, I shoved her away.
She stumbled back as her
heels caught in the carpet.
“Don’t put that on me,” I
warned, my voice low and
hard. “I’m not responsible for
your happiness. I’m not
responsible for you at all.”
“What’s wrong with you?”
she cried. “This isn’t you.”
“You wouldn’t know.” I
went to the door and yanked
it open. “Go home to your
husband, Corinne. Take care
of yourself.”
“Fuck you,” she hissed.
“You’re going to regret this,
and I might be too hurt to
forgive you.”
“Good-bye, Corinne.”
She stared at me for a long
minute and then stormed out
of my office.
“Damn it.” I pivoted, not
knowing where to go or what
to do, but I had to do
something. Anything. I paced.
I’d pulled out my
smartphone and called Eva
before I consciously made the
decision to do so.
“Mark Garrity’s office,”
she began.
“Angel.” The one word
betrayed my relief at hearing
her voice. She was what I
needed. Something in me had
known that.
“Gideon.” She read me
immediately, as she so often
did. “Is everything all right?”
I glanced out at my staff in
the distant cubicles getting
into the groove of the day. I
hit the controls to frost the
glass, carving out a moment
alone with my wife.
I lightened my tone, not
wanting to cause her stress. “I
miss you already.”
She waited a beat before
replying, adjusting to my
mood. “Liar,” she shot back.
“You’re too busy.”
“Never. Now, tell me how
much you’re missing me.”
She laughed. “You’re
terrible. What am I going to
do with you?”
“Everything.”
“Damn straight. So what’s
up? It’s going to be a busy
day and I have to get going.”
I went to my desk and
studied her photo. My
shoulders relaxed. “Just
wanted you to know I’m
thinking about you.”
“Good. Don’t stop. And
FYI, it’s nice to hear you not
grumpy at work.”
It was nice to hear her,
period. I’d given up trying to
figure out why she affected
me the way she did. I just
appreciated that she could
reset my day. “Tell me you
love me.”
“Madly. You rock my
world, Mr. Cross.”
I stared into her laughing
eyes, my fingertip brushing
lightly over the glass.
“You’re the center of mine.”
THE rest of the morning
passed swiftly and
uneventfully. I was wrapping
up a meeting regarding a
possible investment in a
proposed resort chain when
yet another personal
interruption showed up. So
much for workflow.
“You’ve got to fuck up
everything, don’t you?” my
brother accused, barging into
my office with Scott on his
heels.
With a look, I gave Scott
the okay to back out. He shut
the door behind him.
“Good afternoon to you,
too, Christopher.”
We shared blood but could
not have been less alike. Like
his father’s, his hair was
wavy and fell somewhere
between brown and red. His
eyes were a gray mixed with
green, while I was most
definitely our mother’s son.
“Did you forget that Vidal
Records is Ireland’s legacy,
too?” he snapped, his eyes
hard.
“I never forget that.”
“Then you just don’t give a
shit. Your vendetta against
Brett Kline is costing us
money, damn you. You’re
hurting all of us, not just
him.”
Moving to my desk, I
leaned against it and crossed
my arms. I should’ve seen it
coming, considering how
irate Christopher had become
at the Times Square launch of
the “Golden” video. He
wanted Kline and Eva
together. More than that, he
wanted Eva and me apart.
It was the sad truth that I
brought out the worst in my
brother. The only times he
ever acted cruelly or rashly
was when he was trying to
hurt me. I’d seen him give
brilliant speeches, charm
people with his natural
charisma, and impress board
members with his industry
savvy, but he never displayed
those traits toward me.
Frustrated by his
unprovoked animosity, I
baited him. “I’m assuming
you’re going to get to the
point soon.”
“Don’t play innocent,
Gideon. You knew exactly
what you were doing when
you systematically destroyed
every media opportunity
Vidal secured for Six-
Ninths.”
“If those opportunities
were centered on Eva, they
had no business being
pursued to begin with.”
“That’s not your decision
to make.” His mouth twisted
in a scornful smile. “Do you
even comprehend the damage
you’ve done? Behind the
Music has delayed their
special because Sam Yimara
no longer owns the rights to
the footage he compiled of
the band’s early years.
Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives
can’t include Pete’s 69th
Street Bar in their San Diego
episode, because it’s being
demolished before they can
film their segment. And
Rolling Stone isn’t interested
in pursuing their proposed
piece on ‘Golden’ since your
engagement was announced.
The song loses its interest
without the happy ending.”
“I can get you the footage
VH1 wants. Put them in
touch with Arash and he’ll
take care of it.”
“After you remove all
traces of Eva? What’s the
point?”
My brows lifted. “The
point is supposed to be Six-
Ninths, not my wife.”
“She’s not your wife yet,”
he shot back, “and that’s your
problem. You’re afraid she’s
going to go back to Brett.
You’re not really her type and
we all know it. You can eat
her pussy at parties, but what
she really likes is blowing
rock stars in public—”
I was on him before he
blinked. My fist hit his jaw;
his head jerked back. I caught
him with a follow-up left and
he stumbled, crashing into the
glass wall.
Through it, I glimpsed
Scott shoving to his feet, and
then I braced for the impact
of Christopher’s body
hurtling into mine. We went
down. I rolled, punching his
ribs until he groaned. He
slammed his head into my
temple.
The room spun.
Dazed, I rolled away and
clambered to my feet.
Christopher pulled himself
up by the coffee table, blood
running from the side of his
lips and onto the carpet. His
jaw was swelling and he
gasped for air, dragging in
harsh breaths. My fists ached
and I flexed my hands,
tensing with the need to hit
him again. If he’d been
anyone else, I would have.
“Do it,” he taunted, wiping
his mouth on his sleeve.
“You’ve wanted me dead
since the day I was born.
Why stop now?”
“You’re insane.”
Two security guards
rounded the corner at a run,
but I held up a hand to stop
them.
“I’m fucking onto you,
asshole,” my brother growled,
pushing heavily to his feet.
“I’ve talked to members of
the board. Explained what
you’re doing. You want to
take me down, I’m fighting
you all the way.”
“You’ve lost it, you
fucking idiot. Take your
crazy somewhere else. And
leave Eva alone. You want to
make an enemy out of me,
screwing around with her is
the way to do it.”
He stared at me for a long
minute, then laughed harshly.
“Does she know what you’re
doing to Brett?”
I winced through a deep
breath, a dull ache in my side
from a forming bruise. “I’m
not doing anything to Kline.
I’m protecting Eva.”
“And the band is just
collateral damage?”
“Better him than her.”
“Fuck that,” he snarled.
“Fuck you.”
Christopher stalked toward
the door.
I should’ve let him go but
found myself speaking
instead. “For Christ’s sake,
Christopher, they’re talented.
They don’t need a gimmick to
be successful. If you weren’t
so damned eager to make me
pay for something you’ve
imagined I’ve done, you’d be
concentrating on better angles
than making them into a onehit
wonder.”
He rounded on me with
clenched fists. “Don’t tell me
how to do my job. And don’t
get in my way or I’ll shove
you out.”
I watched him leave,
escorted by security. Then I
went to my desk and checked
my message log. Scott had
noted that two of Vidal
Records’ board members had
called over the course of the
day.
I opened the line between
Scott and me. “Get me Arash
Madani.”
If Christopher wanted a
war, I’d give him one.
I arrived at Dr. Lyle
Petersen’s office on time at
six o’clock. The psychologist
greeted me with a welcoming
smile, his dark blue eyes
warm and friendly.
After the day I’d had,
spending an hour with a
shrink was the last thing I
wanted to do. Spending an
hour alone with Eva was what
I needed more.
Our session began as they
always did, with Dr. Petersen
asking how my week had
been and me answering as
succinctly as possible. Then
he said, “Let’s talk about the
nightmares.”
I leaned back, laying my
arm on the sofa’s armrest. I’d
been up front about my sleep
problems from the beginning
in order to get the
prescription medication that
made me marginally safer for
Eva to be near at night, but
dissecting the dreams had
never been one of the topics
on discussion.
That meant someone else
had brought them up. “You
talked to Eva.”
It wasn’t a question, since
the answer was evident.
“She sent me an e-mail
earlier,” he confirmed,
folding his hands atop his
tablet screen.
My fingers drummed
silently.
His gaze followed the
movement. “Does it bother
you that she contacted me?”
I weighed my response
before giving it. “She
worries. If talking to you
alleviates that, I won’t
complain. You’re also her
therapist, so she has a right to
discuss it with you.”
“But you don’t like it.
You’d prefer to choose which
issues you share with me.”
“I’d prefer Eva to feel
safe.”
Dr. Petersen nodded.
“That’s why you’re here. For
her.”
“Of course.”
“What does she hope the
outcome of our sessions will
be?”
“Don’t you know?”
He smiled. “I’d like to hear
your answer to that question.”
After a moment, I gave it
to him. “Eva previously made
bad decisions. She learned to
rely on the advice of
therapists. It worked well for
her and it’s what she knows.”
“How do you feel about
that?”
“Do I have to feel
anything?” I countered. “She
asked me to try it out and I
agreed. Relationships are
about compromise, aren’t
they?”
“Yes.” Picking up his
stylus, he tapped at the screen
of his tablet. “Tell me about
your previous experience
with therapy.”
I took a breath. Let it out.
“I was a child. I don’t
remember.”
He glanced at me over the
rim of his glasses. “How did
you feel about seeing
someone? Angry, frightened,
sad?”
Glancing down at my
wedding ring, I replied, “A
little of all that.”
“I imagine you felt
similarly about your father’s
suicide.”
I stilled. Studying him, my
gaze narrowed. “Your point?”
“We’re just talking,
Gideon.” He leaned back. “I
often feel like you’re
wondering what the angle is.
I don’t have an angle. I just
want to help you.”
I forced my posture to
relax.
I wanted the nightmares to
stop. I wanted to share the
same bed as my wife. I
needed Dr. Petersen to help
me do that.
However, I didn’t want to
talk about things that couldn’t
be changed to get there.

“HEY, GIRL. WHAT are your
thoughts on karaoke?”
Shawna Ellison asked the
second I answered the phone.
I dropped my pencil onto
the notepad I’d been
scribbling in, then sat back on
the couch and curled my legs
onto the cushion. It was
rolling past nine o’clock and I
hadn’t heard from Gideon
yet. I didn’t know if that was
a good or bad sign,
considering he’d had an
appointment with Dr.
Petersen earlier.
The sun had set nearly an
hour before, and I’d been
trying not to think of my
husband every five seconds
since. Chatting with Shawna
was a welcome distraction.
“Well,” I hedged, “since
I’m tone deaf, my thoughts
on singing in public are pretty
much nonexistent. Why?”
In my head, I pictured the
vibrant redhead who was
quickly becoming a friend. In
a lot of ways, she was like her
brother Steven, who
happened to be engaged to
my boss. They were both fun
and easygoing, quick to tease
and yet rock solid, too. I liked
the Ellison siblings a lot.
“Because I was thinking
we could go to this new
karaoke bar I heard about
today at work,” she
explained. “Instead of those
cheesy background tracks,
this place has a live band.
You don’t have to sing if you
don’t want to. A lot people go
just to watch.”
I reached for the tablet
lying on the coffee table.
“What’s the name of this
place?”
“The Starlight Lounge. I
thought it might be fun for
Friday.”
My brows went up. Friday
was our bringing-the-crewtogether
night. I tried to
imagine Arnoldo or Arash
singing karaoke and just the
thought made me smile. Why
the hell not? At the very least,
it’d break the ice.
“I’ll mention it to Gideon.”
I ran a search for the bar and
pulled up its website. “Looks
nice.”
The name had conjured
thoughts of old-school
crooner hangouts, but the
images on the site were of a
contemporary club decorated
in shades of blue with chrome
accents. It looked upscale and
swank.
“Right? I thought so, too.
And it’ll be entertaining.”
“Yeah. Wait ’til you see
Cary with a mic. He’s
shameless.”
She laughed and I grinned
at the sound, which was as
bubbly as champagne. “So is
Steven. Let me know what
you decide. Can’t wait to see
you.”
We hung up, and I tossed
my phone onto the cushion
beside me. I was leaning
forward to get back to my
project when I heard the ping
of a text message.
It was from Brett. We need
to talk. Call me.
I stared at his picture on
the screen for a long minute.
He’d been calling all day but
hanging up when he got my
voice mail. I would be lying
if I said I wasn’t conflicted
about him still reaching out,
but it was a dead end. Maybe
we’d be friends someday, but
not now. I wasn’t up for it or
the stress it caused Gideon.
I used to think facing
issues that made me
uncomfortable showed
strength and responsibility.
Now, I realized that
sometimes resolution wasn’t
the purpose. Sometimes, you
just had to take the
opportunity to examine
yourself better.
I’ll give you a ring when I can,
I typed back. Then I set the
phone aside again. I’d call
him when Gideon was with
me. No secrets and nothing to
hide.
“Hey.” Cary strolled into
the living room from the
hallway dressed in pajama
bottoms and a threadbare Tshirt.
His dark brown hair
was still damp from the
shower he must have taken
after Tatiana left an hour
earlier.
I was glad she hadn’t spent
the night. I wanted to like the
woman who said she was
carrying my best friend’s
baby, but the leggy model
didn’t make it easy for me. I
felt like she deliberately
baited me whenever she
could. I got the strong
impression that she would
like nothing more than to
keep Cary all to herself and I
was viewed as a big
roadblock to that end.
My best friend sprawled
facedown on the other section
of the sofa, his head near my
thigh and his long legs
stretched out. “Whatcha
working on?”
“Making lists. I want to get
started on something for
abuse survivors.”
“Yeah? What are you
thinking?”
One of my shoulders lifted
in a helpless shrug. “I don’t
really know. I keep thinking
about Megumi and how she
didn’t tell anyone. I didn’t tell
anyone, either. Neither did
you, until way later.”
“Because who’s going to
give a shit?” he said gruffly,
propping his chin on his
hands.
“And it’s scary to talk
about it. There are a lot of
hotlines and shelters for
victims. I want to find
something else that makes a
difference, but I don’t have
any groundbreaking ideas.”
“So talk to idea people.”
My mouth curved. “You
make it sound so easy.”
“Hell, why reinvent the
wheel? Find someone who’s
doing it right and help ’em
out.” He rolled onto his back
and scrubbed at his face with
both hands.
I knew that gesture and
what it signified. Something
was eating at him.
“Tell me about your day,” I
said. I’d ended up spending
more one-on-one time with
Gideon in San Diego than I
had with Cary, and I felt bad
about that. Cary said he’d had
a good time hanging with his
old crowd, but that hadn’t
been the purpose of our trip. I
felt like I’d let him down,
even though he didn’t accuse
me of doing so.
He dropped his hands to
his sides. “I had a shoot this
morning, and then I saw Trey
for a late lunch.”
“Did you say anything to
him about the baby?”
He shook his head. “I
thought about it, but I
couldn’t do it. I’m such a
dick.”
“Don’t be hard on yourself.
It’s a rough spot you’re in.”
Cary’s eyes closed,
shuttering the vivid green of
his irises. “I was thinking the
other day how much easier
it’d be if Trey swung both
ways. Then we could both be
banging Tat and each other,
and I could have it all. Then I
realized I didn’t want to share
Trey with Tat. Don’t mind
sharing her. But not him. Tell
me that doesn’t make me a
total douche.”
Reaching out, I ruffled my
fingers through his dark hair.
“It makes you human.”
I’d been in a similar
situation with Gideon,
thinking I could work out a
way to be friends with Brett,
even while I was aggravated
that Gideon was friends with
Corinne. “In a perfect world,
none of us would be selfish,
but that’s not the way it goes.
We just do our best.”
“You’re always making
excuses for me,” he muttered.
I thought about that for a
second. “No,” I corrected
gently, bending over to press
a kiss to his forehead. “I just
forgive you. Someone has to,
since you won’t forgive
yourself.”
WEDNESDAY morning came
and went in a flurry. Lunch
was on me before I knew it.
“We were celebrating our
engagement two weeks ago,”
Steven Ellison said, as I
settled into the chair he held
out for me. “Now we get to
celebrate yours.”
I smiled; I couldn’t help it.
There was something
infectiously joyful about my
boss’s fiancé, which you
couldn’t help but pick up on.
“Must be something in the
water.”
“Must be.” He glanced at
his partner, then back at me.
“Mark’s not losing you, is
he?”
“Steven,” Mark
admonished, shaking his
head. “Don’t.”
“I’m not going anywhere,”
I answered, which earned me
a surprised and pleased grin
from my boss. His goateeframed
smile was as
contagious as Steven’s
gregariousness. Really, our
scheduled lunches were worth
the price of admission.
“Well, I’m happy to hear
that,” Mark said.
“Me, too.” Steven opened
his menu with a decisive
snap, as if something
important had been decided.
“We want you to stick
around, kid.”
“I’m sticking,” I assured
them.
The server set a basket of
olive oil–drizzled garlic bread
on the table between us, then
rattled off the day’s specials.
The restaurant the guys had
selected had two menus:
Italian and Greek.
Like most Manhattan
eateries, the location was
small and the tables packed
tightly together, close enough
that one party flowed into the
next and you had to watch
your elbows. The scents
flowing out of the kitchen and
wafting from the trays of
passing servers had my
stomach growling audibly.
Thankfully the noise from the
lunch crowd frenzy was loud
enough to cover me.
Steven ran a hand through
the bright red hair many
women would kill for. “I’m
having the moussaka.”
“Me, too.” I closed my
menu.
“Pepperoni pizza for me,”
Mark said.
Steven and I teased him
about being adventurous.
“Hell,” he shot back,
“marrying Steven is
adventure enough.”
Grinning, Steven set his
elbow on the table and his
chin on his fist. “So, Eva …
how’d Cross propose? I’m
guessing he didn’t blurt it out
in the middle of the street.”
Mark, who was sitting on
the bench seat next to his
partner, gave him an
exasperated look.
“No,” I agreed. “He broke
the news to me on a private
beach. I can’t say he asked,
because he pretty much just
told me that we’re getting
married.”
Mark’s mouth twisted in
thought, but Steven was blunt
as always. “Romance, Gideon
Cross style.”
I laughed. “Absolutely.
He’ll be the first to tell you
he’s not romantic, but he’s
wrong about that.”
“Let me see the ring.”
I held my hand out to
Steven and the Asscher cut
diamond shot sparks of
multihued fire. It was a
beautiful ring, which held
beautiful memories for
Gideon. Elizabeth Vidal’s
thoughts on the subject
couldn’t touch that.
“Whoa. Mark, darlin’, you
have got to get me one of
those.”
The picture in my head of
the flame-haired, burly
contractor wearing a ring like
mine was comical.
Mark shot him a look. “So
you can shatter it on a job
site? Let me get right on
that.”
“Diamonds are tough little
beauties, but I’ll take good
care of it.”
“You’ll have to wait until I
run an agency of my own,”
my boss retorted with a snort.
“I can do that.” Steven
winked at me. “You register
anywhere yet?”
I shook my head. “You?”
“Hell, yeah.” He twisted to
open the messenger bag next
to him and pulled out his
wedding binder. “Tell me
what you think about these
patterns.”
Mark raised his gaze
heavenward with a longsuffering
sigh. I grabbed a
piece of garlic bread and
leaned forward with a happy
hum.
I worked on the LanCorp
RFP the remainder of the
afternoon.
When my day ended, I
headed to my Krav Maga
class with Raúl. On the way, I
reread Clancy’s reply to my
text saying I wouldn’t need a
ride from him. He had typed
back that it was no problem,
but I felt the need to explain
further.
Gideon wants to have his ppl
with me moving forward, so you’re
free from now on. ☺ TY for all
your help.
It didn’t take him long to
answer. Anytime. Holler when
you need me. BTW, your friend
shouldn’t have any more trouble.
The “thank you” I sent
back didn’t seem like enough.
I made a note to send him
something that would better
express my gratitude.
Raúl parked outside the
brick-faced converted
warehouse that was Parker
Smith’s Krav Maga studio
and then escorted me inside,
taking a seat on the bleachers.
His presence threw me off a
little bit. Clancy had always
waited outside. Having Raúl
watching made me a little
self-conscious.
The massive open space
still managed to look
crowded, thanks to all the
clients on the mats and in
one-on-ones with instructors.
The noise was nearly
deafening, a cacophony of
bodies hitting padding, flesh
colliding with flesh, and the
various shouts as participants
psyched themselves up while
psyching each other out.
Giant metal delivery-bay
doors added to both the
industrial feel of the studio
and the heat, which even the
air-conditioning and multiple
standing fans couldn’t quite
alleviate.
I was stretching in
preparation for the grueling
drills ahead when a pair of
lanky legs came into my line
of sight. I straightened and
faced NYPD detective
Shelley Graves.
She wore her curly brown
hair in a bun as severe as her
face, and her blue eyes
assessed me with sharp
impassiveness. I was afraid of
her and what she could do to
Gideon, but I admired her a
lot, too. She was fierce and
confident in a way I could
only aspire to.
“Eva,” she greeted me.
“Detective Graves.” She
was dressed for work in dark
slacks and a red jersey top.
She wore a black blazer that
didn’t hide either her badge
or her firearm. Her boots
were scuffed and nononsense,
much like her
attitude.
“Spotted you on my way
out. Heard about your
engagement.
Congratulations.”
My stomach flipped a little.
Part of Gideon’s alibi—if one
could call it that—was that
we’d been broken up when
Nathan was killed. Why
would a powerful, upstanding
public figure kill a guy over
an ex he’d left behind without
looking back?
Getting engaged so quickly
had to look suspicious.
Graves had told me she and
her partner had moved on to
other cases, but I understood
what kind of cop she was.
Shelley Graves believed in
justice. She believed Nathan
had gotten his, but I knew
something inside her
questioned whether Gideon
had something to pay for, too.
“Thank you,” I replied,
pulling my shoulders back. In
this, Gideon and I were a
team. “I’m a lucky girl.”
She glanced at the
bleachers. At Raúl. “Where’s
Ben Clancy?”
I frowned. “I don’t know.
Why?”
“Just curious. You know,
one of the feds I talked to
about Yedemsky also has the
last name Clancy.” Her gaze
bored into me. “You think
they’re any relation?”
The blood drained out of
my head at the mention of the
Russian mobster whose
corpse had been sporting
Nathan’s bracelet. I swayed a
little with a sudden rush of
dizziness. “What?”
She nodded, as if she’d
expected as much. “Probably
not. Anyway, I’ll see you
later.”
I watched her walk away,
her attention on Raúl. Then,
she paused and faced me
again. “You inviting me to
the wedding?”
I fought through the
buzzing in my head to say,
“The reception. We’re
keeping the wedding small,
just family.”
“Really? Didn’t expect
that.” Something like a smile
transformed her thin face.
“He’s full of surprises, isn’t
he?”
I couldn’t even begin to
decipher what that meant. I
was too busy trying to
process everything else she’d
said. I didn’t even realize I’d
chased after her until I had
her elbow in my hand.
She stopped, her body taut
in a way that told me to let
go. Which I did. Immediately.
I stared at her for a beat,
trying to pull my thoughts
together. Clancy. Gideon.
Nathan. What the hell did it
mean? Where was she going
with it?
Most of all, why did I feel
as if she were helping me?
Looking out for me. For
Gideon.
What I ended up saying
startled me. “I’m looking to
support an organization that
does good work for abuse
survivors.”
Her brows rose. “Why are
you telling me?”
“I don’t know where to
start.”
She shot me a look. “Try
Crossroads,” she said dryly.
“I’ve heard good things about
that one.”
I was sitting cross-legged on
the floor of my bedroom’s
sitting room when Gideon
came home. He walked in
wearing loose-legged jeans
and a V-neck white T-shirt,
the keys to my place spinning
around his finger.
I stared. I couldn’t help it.
Would he always stop my
heart? I hoped so.
The room was small and
girly, decorated by my
mother with antiques, such as
the silly escritoire I was
supposed to use as a desk.
Gideon infused a drugging
dose of testosterone into the
space, making me feel soft
and feminine and eager to be
ravished.
“Hi, ace.” The love and
longing he inspired were
exposed in those two words.
The keys were caught in
his hand abruptly and he
came to a stop, looking down
at me much as he had that
first day in the Crossfire
lobby. His eyes took on the
brooding fierceness I found
wildly exciting.
For some reason I would
probably never understand,
he felt the same about me.
“Angel mine.” He dropped
gracefully into a crouch, his
hair sliding briefly along his
cheekbones in a loving
caress. “What are you
working on?”
His fingers rifled through
the papers scattered on the
floor around me. Before my
research into his Crossroads
Foundation distracted him, I
caught his hand and squeezed
it.
I blurted out what I knew,
as abruptly as the info had
been sprung on me. “It was
Clancy, Gideon. Clancy and
his brother in the FBI planted
Nathan’s bracelet on that
mobster.”
He nodded. “I figured.”
“You did? How?” I
smacked him on the shoulder.
“Why didn’t you say
something? I’ve been worried
sick.”
Gideon settled on the floor
in front of me, crossing his
long legs in a pose mirroring
mine. “I don’t have all the
answers yet. Angus and I
have been narrowing it down.
Whoever was responsible was
either watching Nathan or me
and following our
movements, so we started
there.”
“Or watching both of you.”
“Precisely. Who would do
that? Who had a stake in it?
In you?”
“Jesus.” I searched his
face. “Detective Graves
knows. The FBI. Clancy—”
“Graves?”
“She brought it up at
Parker’s studio tonight.
Tossed it at me in passing just
to see how I’d take the news.”
His gaze narrowed. “Either
she’s fucking with you or she
wants you to stop worrying.
My bet is on the latter.”
I almost asked why, but
then I realized I’d come to the
same conclusion. The
detective was tough as nails,
but she had a heart. I had
caught glimpses of it during
the few times we’d interacted
with one another. And she
was good at her job,
obviously.
“We have to trust her,
then?” I asked, crawling over
the brochures and paperwork
to curl into his lap.
He pulled me into him,
fitting me into the hard planes
of his body as if I were meant
to be there always. I felt that
way when he held me. Safe.
Treasured. Adored.
His lips touched my
forehead. “I’m going to talk
to Clancy just to be sure, but
he’s no fool. He wouldn’t
leave anything to chance.”
My hand tightened around
a fistful of his T-shirt,
hanging on to him with
everything I had. “Don’t keep
things like this from me,
Gideon. Stop trying to protect
me.”
“I can’t.” His grip on me
tightened, too. “Maybe I
should have said something,
but we have only a few hours
alone every day and I want
them to be perfect.”
“Gideon. You’ve got to let
me in.”
His chest expanded
beneath my cheek, his heart
beating strong and sure. “I’m
working on it, Eva.”
That was all I could ask
for.
THE next morning I padded
into the kitchen on bare feet
to find Gideon pouring
coffee. I could say the smell
of java is what added a spring
to my step, but it was the
sight of my husband, freshly
shaved and dressed with his
vest hanging open, that did it.
I loved seeing him a little
undone.
He looked me over as I
went to him, my heels
rapping on the marble, his
face impassive and his eyes
warm. Did he get the same
kick when he caught sight of
me ready to tackle my day? I
doubted it. I was convinced
men just saw hot … or not.
Wrapping my fingers
around his wrist, I led his
hand around me and up the
back of my skirt to cup the
undercurve of my buttock.
A smile teased the corners
of his lips. “Hello to you, too,
Mrs. Cross.”
He snapped the back of my
garter against my thigh. I
jumped at the sting and
gasped as warmth spread
outward from the spot.
“Hmm … you like that.”
He smirked.
My lower lip stuck out in a
pout. “It hurt.”
Gideon shifted to lean back
against the counter and pulled
me between his spread legs,
both of his hands lightly
gripping the back of my
thighs. He nuzzled his nose
against my temple and
massaged the place that
burned. “I’m sorry, angel.”
Then he snapped my garter
on the other side.
I arched in surprise, my
body aligning with his. He
was hard. Again. A low moan
escaped me. “Stop it.”
“It’s turning you on,” he
murmured in my ear.
“It hurts!” I complained,
even as I rubbed against him.
He’d woken me with soft
kisses and provocative hands.
I had thanked him in the
shower with my mouth. Still,
he could go again. I could,
too. We were addicted to
each other.
“Want me to kiss it and
make it better?” His fingers
slid between my thighs and
found me warm and ready.
He groaned. “Christ. What
you do to me, Eva. I’ve got so
much to do …”
God, he felt good. Smelled
even better. My arms
wrapped around his neck.
“We have to go to work.”
He yanked me up to my
toes, grinding me against his
erection. “We’re playing with
these garters later.”
I kissed him. I put my open
mouth over his and devoured
him, my tongue touching his.
Stroking it greedily. Sucking.
Gideon’s hand fisted in my
ponytail, holding me in place
as he took over the kiss,
fucking my mouth, drinking
me in. In an instant, I was
hot, my skin humid with
perspiration.
His lips were firm yet soft
against my own, his grip
angling me just the way he
wanted, his teeth scraping
gently across my lower lip.
The taste of him, flavored
delectably with a hint of rich
black coffee, intoxicated me.
Drunk on him, I clutched his
hair in my hands, holding on,
my toes flexing to push me
closer. Always closer. But
never close enough.
“Whoa.” Cary’s voice
broke me out of the sensual
spell Gideon had cast. “Don’t
forget we eat in here.”
I started to pull away from
my husband, but he held me
tight, allowing me only to
break the kiss. My gaze met
his. His eyes were sharply
alert beneath heavy lids, his
lips softened and damp.
“Good morning, Cary,” he
said, his attention shifting to
my best friend as Cary joined
us by the coffeemaker.
“For you two, maybe.”
Cary opened the cupboard
that held the mugs and pulled
one out. “Sadly, I’m too tired
to get turned on by the show.
Not making me feel too
optimistic about the rest of
the day.”
He was dressed in skinny
jeans and a navy T-shirt, his
hair skillfully arranged in a
trendy pompadour. I pitied
the single Manhattanites
who’d see him out and about
that day. He was such a
striking man, both physically
and in the false confidence he
exuded.
“Do you have a shoot
today?” I asked.
“No. Tat does, and she
wants me there. She’s got
morning sickness and shit, so
I’m going to be around to
help her out if she’s not
feeling well.”
I reached out and rubbed
his biceps in sympathy.
“That’s awesome, Cary.
You’re the best.”
His lips twisted wryly as he
lifted his steaming cup to his
mouth. “What else can I do? I
can’t get sick for her, and
she’s got to work as long as
she can.”
“You’ll let me know if
there’s anything I can do?”
He shrugged. “Sure.”
Gideon’s hand stroked up
and down my back, offering
wordless support. “If you’ve
got the time, Cary, I’d like
you to be there for the
appointment with the
designer who’s renovating
our place on Fifth Avenue.”
“Yeah, I’ve been thinking
about that.” Cary cocked his
hip into the counter. “I
haven’t totally worked things
out with Tat, but I figure
we’ll be shacking up together
at some point. You guys
aren’t going to want a
screaming baby next door.
When you’re ready for that,
you’ll have your own, not put
up with mine.”
“Cary …” My best friend
rarely looked beyond the next
fifteen minutes of his life. To
hear him stepping up to the
plate so solidly made me love
him all the more.
“Both sections of the
penthouse are fully
soundproofed,” Gideon said,
his voice holding the firm
note of command that
reassured everyone who
heard it. “We can make
anything work, Cary. You
just tell me what concerns
you have and we’ll address
them.”
Cary looked into his mug,
his beautiful face suddenly
looking worn and tired.
“Thanks. I’ll talk to Tat about
it. It’s hard, you know? She
doesn’t want to think about
what’s next and I can’t stop
thinking about it. There’s
going to be this person who’s
totally dependent on us, and
we need to be prepared for
that. Somehow.”
I stepped back and Gideon
let me go. It was hard to
watch Cary struggling. It was
scary, too. He didn’t handle
challenges well and I was so
afraid he’d slip back into
familiar, self-destructive
coping mechanisms. It was a
threat we both faced on a
daily basis. I had a group of
people who kept me
anchored. Cary had only me.
“That’s what families are
for, Cary.” I offered a smile.
“To drive each other crazy
and straight into therapy.”
He snorted, then hid his
face behind his mug. The lack
of a glib reply made me even
more anxious. A heavy
silence descended.
Gideon and I both gave
him a minute, taking the time
to grab our own cups of java
and caffeinate ourselves. We
didn’t speak or even look at
each other, not wanting to
create a unit that left Cary
out, but I felt how in sync we
were. It meant so much to
me. I’d never had someone in
my life who was a true
partner, a lover who was
there for more than just a
good time.
Gideon was a miracle in so
many ways.
It struck me then that I had
to make some adjustments,
compromise a little more on
the issue of working with
Gideon. I had to stop thinking
of Team Cross as being his
alone. I had to own it, too, so
I could share in it with him.
“I’ve got time next week,”
Cary said finally, looking at
me, then Gideon.
Gideon nodded. “Let’s
plan on Wednesday, then.
Give us some room to recover
from the weekend.”
Cary’s mouth twitched.
“So it’s that kind of party.”
I smiled back. “Is there any
other kind?”
“How are you?” I asked
Megumi when we sat down
for lunch on Thursday
afternoon.
She looked better than she
had on Monday, but she was
still overdressed for the heat
of the summer. Because of
that, I’d ordered salads for
delivery and we settled in the
break room instead of braving
the steamy day outside.
She managed a wan smile.
“Better.”
“Does Lacey know what
happened?” I wasn’t sure
how close Megumi was to her
roommate, but I hadn’t
forgotten that Lacey had
dated Michael first.
“Not all of it.” Megumi
pushed at her salad with a
plastic fork. “I feel so stupid.”
“We’re always quick to
blame ourselves, but no
means no. It’s not your fault.”
“I know that, but still …”
I knew just how she felt.
“Have you thought about
talking to someone?”
She glanced at me, tucking
her hair behind her ear. “Like
a counselor or something?”
“Yes.”
“Not really. How do you
even start looking for
someone like that?”
“We’ve got mental health
benefits. Call the number on
the back of your insurance
card. They’ll give you a list
of providers to choose from.”
“And I just … pick one?”
“I’ll help you.” And if I got
my act together, I’d find a
way to help more women like
her and me. Something good
had to come of our
experiences. I had the
motivation and the means. I
just had to find the way.
Her eyes glistened.
“You’re a good friend, Eva.
Thanks for being here.”
I leaned over and hugged
her.
“He hasn’t texted me
lately,” she said when I
pulled back. “I keep dreading
that he’s going to, but every
hour that goes by that he
doesn’t, I feel better.”
Settling back in my seat, I
sent a silent thank-you to
Clancy. “Good.”
AT five o’clock, I left work
and took the elevator up to
Cross Industries, hoping to
catch some time with Gideon
before our appointment with
Dr. Petersen.
I’d been thinking about
him all day, about the future I
wanted us to have together. I
wanted him to respect my
individuality and my personal
boundaries, but I also wanted
him to open up some of his
own. I wanted more moments
like this morning with Cary,
when Gideon and I stood
together, facing a situation as
one. I couldn’t really push for
that if I wasn’t willing to
make the same effort.
The redheaded receptionist
at Cross Industries buzzed me
in. She greeted me with a
hard smile that didn’t reach
her eyes. “Can I help you?”
“No, I’m good, thanks,” I
replied, breezing past her. It
would be nice if all of
Gideon’s employees could be
as easy-natured as Scott, but
the receptionist had an issue
with me and I’d just come to
accept it.
I headed back to Gideon’s
office and found Scott’s desk
empty. Through the glass, I
saw my husband at work,
presiding over a meeting with
casual authority. He stood in
front of his desk, leaning
back against it with one ankle
crossed over the other. He
wore his jacket and faced an
audience composed of two
suit-clad gentlemen and one
woman wearing a great pair
of Louboutins. Scott sat off to
the side, taking notes on a
tablet.
Settling into one of the
chairs by Scott’s desk, I
watched Gideon as raptly as
the others in the room with
him. It never ceased to amaze
me how self-assured he was
for a man who was only
twenty-eight. The men he was
meeting with looked to be
twice his age, and yet their
body language and focused
attention told me they
respected my husband and
what he was saying.
Yes, money talked—loudly
—and Gideon had tons of it.
But he conveyed command
and control with subtle
actions. I recognized that
after living with Nathan’s
father, my mom’s first
husband, who’d wielded
power like a blunt instrument.
Gideon knew how to own a
room without thumping his
chest. I doubted the setting
made any difference; he
would be a formidable
presence in anyone’s office.
His head turned and his
gaze met mine. There was no
surprise in those brilliantly
blue eyes of his. He’d known
I was there, had sensed me
just as I often sensed his
approach without looking.
We were connected
somehow, on a level I
couldn’t explain. There were
times when he wasn’t with
me and I just wished he was,
but I still felt him nearby.
I smiled, then dug in my
bag for my phone. I didn’t
want Gideon to feel like I was
just sitting around waiting,
not that doing so would
pressure him at all.
There were dozens of email
messages from my
mother with photo
attachments of dresses and
flowers and wedding venues,
reminding me that I needed to
talk with her about Dad
paying for the ceremony. I’d
been putting off that
conversation all week, trying
to steel myself for her
reaction. There was also
another text from Brett,
telling me that we needed to
talk … urgently.
Standing, I looked around
for a quiet corner where I
could make that call. What I
saw was Christopher Vidal
Sr. rounding the corner.
Gideon’s stepfather was
dressed in the khakis and
loafers I’d come to expect,
with a pale blue dress shirt
open at the collar and rolled
up at the sleeves. The dark
copper waves he’d passed on
to Christopher Jr. were neatly
cut around his neck and ears,
and his slate green eyes were
capped with a frown behind
old-school brass-framed
glasses.
“Eva.” Chris slowed as he
neared me. “How are you?”
“Good. You?”
He nodded, looking over
my shoulder at Gideon’s
office. “Can’t complain. Do
you have a minute? I’d like to
talk to you about something.”
“Sure.” The door opened
behind me and I turned to see
Scott stepping out.
“Mr. Vidal,” he said,
coming toward us. “Miss
Tramell. Mr. Cross will be
another fifteen minutes or so.
Can I get either of you
something to drink while you
wait?”
Chris shook his head.
“Nothing for me, thank you.
But if you have a private
room we could use, that
would be great.”
“Of course.” Scott looked
at me.
“I’m good, thanks,” I
answered.
Leaving his tablet on his
desk, Scott led us to a
conference room with a
sweeping view of the city. A
long, polished wood table
gleamed beneath the recessed
lighting, with a matching
cabinet covering one wall and
a large monitor lining the
other.
“If you need anything,” he
began, “just dial one and
we’ll take care of it. There’s
coffee in the cabinet there,
and water.”
Chris nodded. “Thank you,
Scott. Appreciate it.”
Scott left. Chris gestured
for me to sit, then took the
chair to the right of mine,
spinning it to face me.
“First, let me congratulate
you on your engagement.” He
smiled. “Ireland speaks very
highly of you, and I know
you’ve been instrumental in
bringing her and Gideon
closer together. I can’t thank
you enough for that.”
“I didn’t do much, but I
appreciate the thought.”
He reached for my left
hand, which was resting on
the table. His thumb rubbed
gently over my engagement
ring and his mouth curved
ruefully.
Was he thinking about the
fact that Geoffrey Cross had
selected the ring for
Elizabeth?
“It’s a beautiful ring,” he
said finally. “I’m sure it
meant a great deal to Gideon
to give it to you.”
I didn’t know what to say
to that. It meant a lot to my
husband because it was a
symbol of the love between
his parents.
Chris released my hand.
“Elizabeth is taking this very
hard. I’m sure there are a lot
of complicated emotions a
mother must feel when her
first child decides to get
married, especially with a
son. My mother used to say
that a son is a son until he
gets married—then he’s a
husband—but a daughter is a
daughter for life.”
The conciliatory
explanation rubbed me the
wrong way. He was trying to
be kind, but I was tired of all
the excuses, especially when
it came to Elizabeth Vidal.
The pretending had to end or
Gideon would never stop
hurting.
I needed the pain to stop.
Every time he woke up
crying, it shattered me a little
more. I could only imagine
the damage it was doing to
him.
Still, I debated letting it go
for now. I could argue and
push forever, but Gideon
needed to be the one to
demand the answers and hear
them given.
Put it away. When the time
is right, it’ll happen.
But I found myself leaning
forward instead, unable to
hold the silence Gideon had
kept for too long.
“Let’s be honest,” I
insisted quietly. “Your wife
didn’t have this reaction
when Gideon became
engaged to Corinne.” I didn’t
know that for sure, but having
seen Elizabeth with Corinne’s
parents at the hospital, it
seemed likely.
His sheepish smile proved
me right. “I think that was
different because Gideon had
been with Corinne awhile and
we knew her. You and
Gideon haven’t been together
long, so there’s still some
adjusting to do. I don’t want
you to take it personally,
Eva.”
The smile chafed, but it
was the words that were too
much for me. Resentment
welled and flowed over the
wall I tried to contain it
behind.
Chris wasn’t blameless,
either. Taking a grieving,
troubled boy into his home
had to have been hard—
especially when he’d been
building his own family with
Christopher Jr. and Ireland on
the way. But he’d accepted
the role of stepfather when he
married Elizabeth. He shared
responsibility for pursuing
justice for a wounded and
exploited child. Hell, a
stranger would have an
obligation to report the crime.
Leaning forward, I let him
see how angry I was. “It’s
very personal, Mr. Vidal.
Elizabeth is feeling
threatened because I’m not
going to put up with this
bullshit anymore. You both
owe Gideon an apology and
she needs to admit to the
abuse. I’m going to keep
pressuring her to make things
right. You can count on that.”
His posture stiffened
visibly. “What are you talking
about?”
I snorted with disgust.
“Seriously?”
“Elizabeth would never
abuse her children,” he said
tightly when I didn’t reply.
“She’s a wonderful, devoted
mother.”
I blinked, then stared at
him. Was he as delusional as
Elizabeth? How could they
both act like they didn’t
know?
“I think you’d better
explain yourself, Eva. Fast.”
I sagged back into the
chair, stunned. If he was
acting, he deserved a
goddamned Academy Award.
He surged forward without
getting up, bristling and
aggressive. “Start talking.
Now.”
My voice came quiet.
Small. “He was raped. By the
therapist he was seeing.”
Chris froze. For a long
minute, he didn’t even
breathe.
“He told Elizabeth, but she
didn’t believe him. She
knows he was telling the
truth, but she’s denied it for
whatever screwed-up reason
she’s come up with.”
He straightened, shaking
his head vehemently. “No.”
The one-word rebuff
pushed me to my feet. “Are
you going to deny it, too?
Who would lie about
something like that? Do you
have any idea how hard it
was for him to admit to what
was happening? How
confused he must have been
that a man he trusted would
do those things to him?”
Chris looked up at me.
“Elizabeth would never
ignore … something like that.
There’s a misunderstanding.
You’re confused.”
I took in his dilated pupils
and white-rimmed lips but
refused to feel bad for him.
“She went through the
motions. That’s all. When
push came to shove, she
chose to side with everyone
but her own child.”
“You don’t know what
you’re saying.”
I grabbed the handle of my
bag and slung it over my
shoulder. I bent into him,
meeting him at eye level.
“Gideon was raped. One of
these days, you and your wife
are going to look him in the
eye like I’m looking at you
and you’re going to admit it.
And you’re going to
apologize for all the years
he’s lived with that alone.”
“Eva.”
Gideon’s voice cracked
through the air, making me
jump. Straightening in a rush,
I stumbled as I faced him.
He stood in the open
doorway, his hand gripping
the handle with such force it
should’ve broken off. His
face was hard, his body stiff,
his gaze searing me with a
different kind of heat.
Fury. I’d never seen him so
angry.
Chris pushed heavily to his
feet. “Gideon. What’s going
on? What is she saying?”
Gideon’s arm shot out and
grabbed me. He yanked me
into the hallway with such
force I yelped in alarm. I felt
the bite of his fingers even
after he released me.
With his hand at the small
of my back, he propelled me
forward, his stride so long
and quick I had to scramble
to keep pace.
“Gideon, wait,” I said
breathlessly, my heart
pounding. “We—”
“Not a fucking word,” he
snapped, pushing me roughly
through the etched glass
security doors into the
elevator vestibule.
I heard Chris calling
Gideon’s name. I caught sight
of him rushing toward us just
before the elevator doors shut
him out.

9
AS I LED Eva out of the
Crossfire, Angus took one
look at my face and his smile
disappeared. He opened the
rear door to the Bentley and
stepped aside, watching me
urge my wife into the
backseat.
Our gazes met over her
head as she slid into the back.
I read the message in his
faded blue eyes. Be gentle
with her.
He didn’t know how hard it
was for me to show as much
restraint as I was managing. I
could feel the vein pulsating
in my temple, echoing the
driving pulse beat that had
my cock throbbing.
I’d nearly stopped the
elevator halfway down to
fuck Eva against the wall like
an animal. The only things
that deterred me were the
security cameras and
watchful guard eyes
monitoring the feed.
I wanted to leash her. Sink
my teeth into her shoulder as
I nailed her. Dominate her.
She was a tigress, clawing
and hissing at everyone she
felt had done me wrong, and I
needed to pin her down.
Make her submit.
“Goddamn it,” I bit out,
rounding the back of the car
to get in on the other side.
Eva was a wild card. I
couldn’t control her.
I folded into the seat and
slammed the door shut,
staring out the window
because I was afraid of what
I’d do if I looked at her. She
was the air I breathed and at
the moment, I couldn’t catch
my breath.
She set her hand on my
thigh. “Gideon …”
Grabbing that slender hand
wearing my ring, I shoved it
between my legs and thrust
my aching dick into her palm.
“Open your mouth again and
that’s what I’m putting in it.”
She gasped.
Angus slid behind the
wheel and started the car. I
felt Eva’s gaze on the side of
my face. Her hand pulled
away and I nearly groaned at
the loss of her touch. Then
she shifted, curling into my
side. Her other hand slid back
between my legs, cupping my
cock possessively. Her lips
pressed a kiss against my jaw.
My arm went around her
back. I took a deep breath,
inhaling her scent.
The Bentley pulled away
from the curb and we melded
into midtown traffic.
IT wasn’t until we pulled over
in front of the office building
where Dr. Petersen kept his
office that I remembered our
appointment. I’d been
counting the minutes until we
got home and I could take
Eva the way I needed to …
fast … hard … furious.
She started sitting up when
Angus got out of the car. I
tightened my arm around her.
“Not today,” I said tightly.
“Okay,” she whispered,
kissing my jaw again.
Angus opened the door.
She pulled away, then got out
of the car anyway. She spun
through the revolving doors
and left me staring after her.
“Jesus.”
Ducking down, Angus
peered in at me. “Couples
therapy means the both of
you.”
I glared at him. “Stop
enjoying this.”
The smile in his eyes
curved his lips into a broad
grin. “She loves you, lad,
whether you like it or naw.”
“Of course I like it,” I
muttered, glancing over my
shoulder to check the traffic
before opening my door and
stepping out. I rounded the
trunk. “That doesn’t mean
she’s not a loose cannon.”
Angus shut the door. A
rare summer breeze ruffled
the graying red hair that
peeked out from beneath his
chauffeur’s hat. “Sometimes
you’ll lead, sometimes you’ll
follow. Expect you’ll
grumble about the following
part for a while yet.”
I growled, exasperated.
“She talked to Chris.”
His brows rose with
surprise even as he nodded. “I
saw him go in.”
“Why won’t she leave it
the hell alone?” I stepped
onto the sidewalk, tugging
my vest into place and
wishing I could straighten my
thoughts as easily. “She can’t
change the past.”
“It’s not the past she’s
thinking of.” He set his hand
briefly on my shoulder. “It’s
the future.”
I found Eva pacing in Dr.
Petersen’s office, her hands
waving as she spoke. The
good doctor sat in his
customary chair, his attention
on his tablet as he took notes.
“The whole situation
makes me so mad,” she
seethed. Then she caught
sight of me standing in the
doorway and paused
midstride.
“Gideon.” A brilliant smile
lit up her beautiful face.
There wasn’t anything I
wouldn’t do to put that happy
look on her. The fact that she
smiled like that just because
she saw me …
“Eva. Doctor.” I took a seat
on the sofa. How much had
she told him?
Dr. Petersen followed me
with his gaze. “Hello,
Gideon. I’m glad you could
join us after all.”
I patted the cushion next to
me and waited for Eva to sit.
“We’re making plans to
move back into the penthouse
on Fifth with Cary,” I said
smoothly once she’d settled
beside me, deflecting the
conversation into territory I
was more comfortable
addressing. “I expect it will
be a rocky transition for all of
us.” Eva gaped.
Dr. Petersen set his stylus
down. “Eva was just telling
me about a visit with your
stepfather. I would like to
hear more about that before
we move on.”
I linked my fingers with
Eva’s. “It’s not open for
discussion.”
She stared at me. I turned
my head to meet her gaze and
my breath left me in a pained
rush.
The new look on her face
made me ache for a different
reason altogether.
The session had barely
started and already it couldn’t
end soon enough for me.
I told Angus to take us home
—to the penthouse.
It was obvious Eva was
lost in her own thoughts by
the surprise she displayed
when the valet opened the
door for her. We were in the
subterranean garage beneath
the building.
She glanced at me.
“I’ll explain,” I told her, as
I took her elbow and led her
to the elevator.
We rode up in silence.
When the car doors opened
into our private foyer, I felt
her tense beneath my hand.
We hadn’t been to the
penthouse together in nearly a
month. The last time we’d
been in the foyer had been the
night she confronted me
about Nathan’s death.
I’d been afraid then, too.
Terrified I had done
something she couldn’t
forgive me for.
We’d had many explosive
moments here. The penthouse
hadn’t seen as much joy and
love between us as the secret
apartment on the Upper West
Side. But we would change
that. One day, we would look
back and this place would
remind us of all the steps in
our journey together, good
and bad. I refused to envision
anything else.
I opened the door,
gesturing her in before me.
She dropped her purse into an
armchair and kicked off her
shoes. I shrugged out of my
jacket, hung it on the back of
one of the bar stools in the
kitchen, and then pulled a
shiraz off the wine rack.
“You’re disappointed in
me,” I called out, uncorking
the wine.
Eva padded to the open
archway and leaned against
the tumbled stone. “No, not in
you.”
Retrieving a decanter and
two glasses, I considered my
reply. It was difficult
bargaining with my wife. In
every other deal, I went in
with the knowledge that I
could take it or leave it. There
was no agreement anywhere I
couldn’t walk away from.
Except those that
endangered my hold on Eva.
As I poured the wine from
its bottle into the decanter,
she joined me at the island.
Her hand came to rest on
my shoulder. “We haven’t
been together long, Gideon,
and you’ve come so far
already. I’m not going to
push you to go farther so
soon. These things take
time.”
I let the decanted wine sit
and turned to face her, pulling
her close. She’d felt so far
away the last hour or so and
the distance had been killing
me.
“Kiss me,” I murmured.
Tilting her head back, Eva
lifted her mouth to me. I
pressed my lips to hers but
otherwise did nothing else,
wanting her to be the one to
reach out. Needing her to be.
The stroke of her tongue
over the seam of my lips
made me groan. The feel of
her fingers sliding into the
hair at my nape soothed me.
There was an apology in the
softness of her lips gliding
across mine and love in her
quiet moan of surrender.
I caught her up, lifting her
feet from the floor, so
relieved she still wanted me
that I felt dizzy with it. “Eva
… I’m sorry.”
“Shh, baby, it’s okay.” She
pulled back and touched my
face, cupping it in both hands.
“You don’t have to apologize
to me.”
The back of my throat
burned. I lifted her onto the
counter, stepping between her
spread legs. Her skirt rose up,
baring the ends of her garters.
I wanted her. In every way.
My forehead touched hers.
“You’re upset that I didn’t
want to talk about Chris.”
“I wasn’t expecting you to
avoid it so completely, that’s
all.” She kissed my brow, her
fingers brushing the hair from
my face. “I should’ve
considered the possibility,
considering how angry you
were when we left the
Crossfire.”
“Not with you.”
“At Chris?”
“At the situation.” I
exhaled roughly. “You’re
expecting people to change
and that doesn’t happen. In
the meantime, you’re stirring
up trouble at a time when
we’ve got enough on our
plates. I just want to have
some peace with you, Eva.
Days when we’re alone and
happy and free of any
bullshit.”
“And nights where you go
to sleep in another bed? In
another room?”
My eyes squeezed shut. “Is
that what this is all about?”
“Not completely, but some
of it, yeah. Gideon, I want to
be with you. Waking and
sleeping.”
“I understand, but—”
“That peace you’re looking
for? You’re pretending you
have it during the day and
suffering without it at night.
It’s tearing you up from the
inside, and it’s shredding me
watching it happen to you. I
don’t want you to live like
this forever. I don’t want us
to live forever like this.”
I looked at her, my soul
bared to those amazing steelcolored
eyes that didn’t let
me hide anything. There was
so much love in the look she
gave me. Love and worry,
disappointment and hope.
The pendant lamps over the
island backlit her blond hair,
reminding me of how
precious she was. A gift I’d
never expected.
“Eva … I am talking to Dr.
Petersen about the
nightmares.”
“But not about what’s
causing them.”
“You’re assuming Hugh is
the problem,” I said evenly,
feeling the burn of hatred and
humiliation in my gut.
“We’ve been talking about
my father instead.”
She pulled back. “Ace … I
don’t know exactly what’s in
your dreams, but I’ve seen
you wake up in two different
ways: ready to beat up
someone or crying like your
heart is breaking. When you
come out swinging, the things
you say make me damn near
certain you’re fighting off
Hugh.”
I sucked in a quick, deep
breath. It infuriated me that
my former therapist—and
molester—could reach out
from the grave and touch Eva
through me.
“Listen.” She wrapped her
legs around my hips. “I said I
wasn’t going to push you and
I meant it. If we were two
years into our relationship,
I’d put up a fuss, maybe. But
it’s only been a few months,
Gideon. The fact that you’re
seeing someone and talking
about your dad is enough for
now.”
“Is it?”
“Yes. But there are things
we can never discuss that are
haunting you, too. Dr.
Petersen is already working
with a handicap because of
that. The more you keep from
him, the less he can help.”
Nathan. She didn’t have to
say the name.
“I’m making an effort,
Eva.”
“I know.” Her hands
smoothed over my shoulders,
then reached for the buttons
of my vest. “Just tell me that
you’re not hoping to avoid
talking about it forever. Tell
me you’re just working up to
it.”
My heart rate sped up. I
reached for her wrists,
holding them firmly,
anchoring myself to her. I felt
cornered, trapped between
her needs and my own, which
seemed terribly divergent at
that moment.
Her lips parted at the
pressure of my grip, her
breasts lifting with a
quickened breath. A
restraining touch, a heated
look, the tone of my voice …
Eva reacted to my unspoken
demands as if she’d been
trained to.
“I’m doing my best,” I told
her.
“That’s not an answer.”
“It’s all I’ve got right now,
Eva.”
She swallowed, her
thoughts scattering as her
body stirred. “You’re playing
with me,” she said quietly.
“You’re manipulating me.”
“I’m not. I’m giving you
the truth, even though it’s not
what you want to hear. You
told me you wouldn’t push.
Did you mean it?”
Wetting her lower lip with
a brush of her tongue, she
stared up at me. Then nodded.
“Yes.”
“Good. Let’s have some
wine and dinner. Afterward,
if you’d really like to play, let
me know.”
“Play? How?”
“I have some silk cord I
bought for you.”
Her eyes widened. “Silk
cord?”
“Crimson, of course.” I
released her and stepped
back, giving her some space
to think while I reached for
the decanter to pour her a
glass. “I’d like to tie you
down when you’re ready for
that. If not tonight, then
someday. I won’t push you,
either.”
We were both steering
each other in directions that
were uncomfortable. She
chose to believe an educated
observer was part of the
answer we were looking for. I
believed we could find a lot
of the answers on our own,
just the two of us connecting
in the most intimate ways
possible.
Sexual healing. What could
be more perfect for two
people who had the history
Eva and I shared?
Eva accepted the wine I
handed her. “When did you
buy that?”
“A week ago. Maybe two. I
had no expectation of using it
soon, but you made me want
to today.” I took a sip, letting
the shiraz roll around my
tongue. “That said, I’m
perfectly happy with just
fucking you hard.”
The wine sloshed a little in
her glass as she lifted it to her
mouth. She gulped it down,
leaving a few drops in the
bottom. “Because you’re mad
at me for talking to Chris.”
“I told you I wasn’t.”
“You were furious when
we left.”
“Furiously turned on.” I
smiled wryly. “I can’t explain
why, because I don’t
understand it myself.”
“Try.”
I reached up and brushed
the pad of my thumb over her
lips. “I see you angry,
passionate, ready to fight, and
I want all that violence
trapped beneath me. You
make me want to hold you
down, clawing and
screaming, your cunt milking
my cock as I pound it into
you. Mine. All mine.”
“Gideon.” She set her glass
aside and grabbed me,
claiming my mouth with a
wild hunger I hoped would
never abate.
“How come you never told
Chris about what happened
with Hugh?”
That unwelcome question
came out of the fucking blue.
I paused midchew, suddenly
finding the bite of pizza in
my mouth unappetizing.
Dropping what was left of my
slice onto the plate in front of
me, I grabbed a napkin and
wiped my mouth. “Why are
we discussing this again?”
Eva frowned at me from
where she sat beside me on
the floor in between the
coffee table and the couch in
the living room. “We didn’t
talk about it.”
“Didn’t we? In any case, it
doesn’t matter. My mother
told him.”
Her frown deepened. She
reached for the TV remote
and lowered the volume,
muting the voices of the
NYPD detectives on the
screen. “I don’t think so.”
I pushed to my feet and
grabbed my plate. “She did,
Eva.”
“Do you know that for
sure?” She followed me into
the kitchen.
“Yes.”
“How?”
“They discussed it at the
dinner table one night,
something I don’t want to
do.”
“He acted like he didn’t
know.” She braced her hands
against the counter as I
dropped my leftovers into the
trash. “He seemed genuinely
confused and horrified.”
“Then he’s as conveniently
obtuse as my mother. You
shouldn’t be surprised.”
“What if he didn’t know?”
“So what?” I set the plate
in the sink, the lingering
smell of food making my
stomach roil. “What the fuck
does it matter now? It’s done,
Eva. Done and over with. Let
it go.”
“Why are you so mad?”
“Because I was settled in
for the night with my wife.
Dinner, wine, a little TV, a
couple hours making love …
after a long, rough day.” I left
the kitchen. “Forget it. I’ll see
you in the morning.”
“Gideon, wait.” She
grabbed my arm. “Don’t go
to bed pissed. Please. I’m
sorry.”
I paused and removed her
hand from my arm. “So am
I.”
“START out slow,” he
whispers, his lips near my
ear.
I can feel him becoming
excited. He reaches around
my hip to where I’m stroking
my penis. His hand covers
mine. His breath is quick and
shallow. His erection brushes
against my buttocks.
My stomach feels sick. I’m
sweating. I can’t stay hard,
even as my oiled fist slides up
and down, guided by his.
“You’re thinking too
much,” he tells me.
“Concentrate on how good it
feels. Look at that woman in
front of you. She wants you to
fuck her. Imagine how it’d
feel to push your cock into
her. Soft. Hot. Wet. And
tight.” His grip closes harder
over mine. “So tight.”
I look at the centerfold
spread over the top of my
toilet’s water tank. She’s got
dark hair and blue eyes, and
her legs are long. They
always look like that, the
women in the pictures Hugh
brings.
He pants in my ear, and the
sickness is back. Wrong.
There’s something wrong
with me. This feels wrong.
His eagerness makes me feel
dirty. Bad. I’m a bad boy,
even Mom says so. She yells it
at me when she’s crying,
when she’s angry with me
about Dad.
A low moan cuts through
the sound of his heavy
breaths. It’s me making that
noise. It feels good, even
though I don’t want it to.
It’s hard to breathe, to
think, to fight …
“That’s it,” he coaxes. His
other hand pushes between
my buttocks.
I try to pull away, but he’s
got me trapped. He’s bigger
than me, stronger. No matter
how I struggle, I can’t push
him off.
“Don’t,” I tell him,
squirming.
“You like it,” he grunts.
His hand pumps me harder.
“You shoot off like a geyser
every time. It’s okay. It’s
supposed to feel good. You’ll
be better once you’ve come.
You won’t fight with your
mother so much …”
“No. Don’t! Oh, God …”
He pushes two slick fingers
inside me. I cry out, writhing
away, but he won’t quit. He’s
rubbing and thrusting into
me, hitting the spot that
makes me want to come more
than anything. The pleasure
grows despite the tears
burning my eyes.
My head falls forward. My
chin touches my heaving
chest. It’s coming. I can’t
stop it …
Abruptly, I look down from
a higher vantage. My hand is
suddenly bigger, my forearm
thicker and coursing with
veins. Dark hair dusts my
arms and chest, my abdomen
ripples with muscle as I fight
the orgasm I don’t want.
I am not a child anymore.
He can’t hurt me anymore.
There’s a knife atop the
centerfold, gleaming in the
light from the vanity beside
me. I grab it and jerk free of
the fingers fucking me. I turn
and the blade sinks into his
chest.
“Don’t touch me!” I roar,
grabbing his shoulder and
yanking him into the knife, all
the way to the hilt.
Hugh’s eyes widen with
horror. His mouth falls open
in a silent scream.
His face morphs into
Nathan’s. My childhood
bathroom shimmers and
transforms. We’re in an eerily
familiar hotel room.
My heart pounds harder. I
can’t be here. They can’t find
me here. Can’t find any trace
of me. I have to leave.
I stumble back. The knife
withdraws in a smooth,
blood-soaked glide. Nathan’s
eyes turn milky with death.
They’re gray. Gray eyes.
Beautiful, beloved dove gray
irises. Eva’s eyes. Clouding
over …
Eva is bleeding in front of
me. Dying in front of me. I’ve
killed her. My God …
Angel!
Can’t move. Can’t reach
her. She crumples and pools
onto the floor, those stormy
eyes dull and sightless—
I jerked awake with a gasp,
sitting up in a rush that sent
an air-conditioned breeze
across my sweat-soaked skin.
I couldn’t breathe through the
panic and fear choking me.
Shoving off the sheet tangled
around my legs, I stumbled
out of bed, blind with terror.
My stomach heaved in protest
and I lurched into the
bathroom, barely reaching the
toilet before I vomited.
I showered, washing away the
sticky sweat covering me.
The grief and despair
weren’t so easy to get away
from. As I scrubbed a dry
towel over my skin, they
weighed heavily, suffocating
me. The memory of Eva’s
pale face etched with betrayal
and death haunted me. I
couldn’t get it out of my
head.
I stripped the bed with
rough, jerky movements, then
yanked a clean fitted sheet
over the mattress.
“Gideon.”
I straightened and turned at
the sound of Eva’s voice. She
stood in the doorway to my
bedroom, her hands twisting
in the hem of the T-shirt she
wore. Regret hit me hard.
She’d gone to sleep alone in
the room I’d had redesigned
to look like her bedroom on
the Upper West Side.
“Hey,” she said softly,
tentatively, shifting on her
feet in a way that told me
how uncomfortable she felt.
How wary. “Are you okay?”
The light from the
bathroom lit her face,
revealing dark circles and
reddened eyes. She’d fallen
asleep crying.
I’d done this to her. I had
made her feel unwelcome,
unwanted, her thoughts and
feelings less of a concern to
me than my own. I’d let my
past drive a wedge between
us.
No, that wasn’t true. I had
let my fear push her away.
“No, angel, I’m not.”
She took a single step
closer, then stopped herself.
Opening my arms, I said
hoarsely, “I’m sorry, Eva.”
She came to me in a rush,
her body lush and warm. I
held her too tightly, but she
didn’t complain. Pressing my
cheek to the top of her head, I
breathed in her scent. I could
face anything—I would face
anything—as long as she
stayed with me.
“I’m afraid.” My voice was
scarcely a whisper, but she
heard it.
Her fingers dug into the
muscles of my back as she
pulled me closer. “Don’t be.
I’m here.”
“I’ll try harder,” I
promised. “Don’t give up on
me.”
“Gideon.” She sighed, her
breath soft against my chest.
“I love you so much. I just
want you to be happy. I’m
sorry for pushing you after I
said I wouldn’t.”
“It’s my fault. I fucked up.
I’m sorry, Eva. So sorry.”
“Shh. You don’t have to
apologize.”
I picked her up and carried
her to the bed, laying her
down carefully. I crawled into
her arms, wrapping myself
around her and resting my
face against her belly. She ran
her fingers through my hair,
massaging my scalp, then my
nape, then my back.
Accepting me, despite all my
flaws.
The cotton of her T-shirt
grew wet with my tears and I
curled in tighter, ashamed.
“I love you,” she
murmured. “I’ll never stop.”
GIDEON.
I stirred at the sound of
Eva’s voice, then at the feel
of her hand sliding down my
chest. Opening my tired,
burning eyes, I saw her
leaning over me, the room
softly lit by the coming dawn,
her hair aglow in the meager
light.
“Angel?”
She shifted, sliding a leg
over me. Rising, she
straddled me. “Let’s make
today our best ever.”
I swallowed hard. “I’m on
board with that plan.”
Her smile rocked my
world. She reached for
something she’d left on her
pillow and a moment later,
haunting strains of music
piped softly out of the
speakers in the ceiling.
It took me a moment to
recognize it. “Ave Maria.”
She touched my face, her
fingertips gliding over my
brow. “Okay?”
I wanted to answer her, but
my throat was too tight. I
could only nod. How could I
tell her it felt like a dream, a
breathtaking heaven I didn’t
deserve?
She reached behind her to
push the sheet below my hips
and out of the way. Her arms
crossed her torso to pull her
shirt up and over her head.
She threw it aside.
Awed, I struggled for my
voice. “God, you’re
beautiful,” I said hoarsely.
My hands lifted, gliding
over the plush curves and
valleys of her voluptuous
body. I sat up and dug my
heels into the bed, pushing us
backward until I was leaning
against the headboard. My
hands went into her hair and
down her throat. I could
touch her for days and not get
my fill.
“I love you,” she said,
tilting her head to take my
mouth in a hot, demanding
kiss.
I let her have me, opening
to her. Eva licked deep,
stroking me with her tongue,
her lips soft and wet against
mine.
“Tell me what you need,” I
murmured, lost to the gently
muted music. Lost to her.
“You. Just you.”
“Take me, then,” I told her.
“I’m yours.”
“I hate to be the one to break
it to you, Cross,” Arash said,
his fingers drumming on the
armrest of the chair in front
of my desk, “but you’ve lost
your killer instinct. Eva’s
tamed you.”
I glanced up from my
monitor. After spending two
hours of my morning making
love with my wife, I could
concede that I wasn’t feeling
particularly aggressive.
Slaked and relaxed was more
apt. Still … “Just because I
don’t think LanCorp’s
PhazeOne gaming system is a
threat to the GenTen doesn’t
mean I’m not paying
attention.”
“You’re aware,” he
corrected, “which isn’t the
same as paying attention, and
I guarantee Ryan Landon has
noticed. You used to do
something every week or two
to poke at him, which—for
better or worse—gave him
something to do.”
“Wasn’t it just last week
that we closed the PosIT
deal?”
“That’s reactive, Cross.
You need to make a move he
didn’t prompt.”
My office phone started
ringing on the line synced to
my smartphone. Ireland’s
name popped up on the
screen and I reached for the
receiver. “I have to take this.”
“Of course you do,” he
muttered.
I narrowed my eyes at him
as I answered. “Ireland, how
are you?”
It wasn’t like my sister to
call. We usually texted back
and forth, a form of
communication we were both
comfortable with. No
awkward silences, no need to
fake cheeriness or ease.
“Hey, sorry to call you in
the middle of the day.” Her
voice was off.
I frowned, concerned.
“What’s wrong?”
Ireland paused. “Maybe
now’s not a good time.”
I cursed inwardly. Eva had
similar reactions when I was
too brusque. The women in
my life needed to cut me
some slack. I had a big
learning curve when it came
to social interactions. “You
sound upset.”
“So do you,” she shot back.
“You can call Eva and
complain about it to her.
She’ll sympathize. Now, tell
me what’s wrong.”
She sighed. “Mom and Dad
were fighting all night. I
don’t know what about, but
Dad was yelling. He never
yells, you know that. He’s the
most laid-back guy ever.
Nothing gets to him. And
Mom hates fighting. She’s a
conflict avoider.”
Her astuteness both startled
and impressed me. “I’m sorry
you had to hear that.”
“Dad took off early this
morning and Mom’s been
crying ever since. Do you
know what’s going on? Is it
about Eva and you getting
married?”
A strange but recognizable
quiet settled over me. I didn’t
know what to say to her, and
I refused to jump to
conclusions. “That probably
has something to do with it.”
The only thing I knew for
certain was that I didn’t want
Ireland listening to her
parents fighting. I
remembered what it had felt
like when my parents fought
in the days after my dad’s
financial fraud had been
exposed. I could still feel
echoes of the panic and fear.
“Is there a friend you can stay
with over the weekend?”
“You.”
The suggestion was
unnerving. “You want to stay
with me?”
“Why not? I’ve never seen
your place.”
I stared at Arash, who was
watching me. He leaned
forward, setting his elbows on
his knees.
I didn’t know how to
refuse, but I couldn’t agree.
The only person who’d ever
spent the night with me was
Eva, and obviously, that
hadn’t turned out well.
“Never mind,” she said.
“Forget it.”
“No, wait.” Damn it. “Eva
and I have plans with friends
tonight, that’s all. I’ll need
some time to change them.”
“Oh, gotcha.” Her voice
softened. “I don’t want to
fuck up your plans. I’ve got
some friends I can call. Don’t
worry about it.”
“I’m worried about you.
Eva and I can make some
adjustments; it’s not a
problem.”
“I’m not a kid, Gideon,”
she said, clearly exasperated.
“I don’t want to hang around
your place knowing you and
Eva were supposed to be out
having fun. That would
totally suck, so no thanks. I’d
rather chill with my own
friends.”
Relief relaxed my spine.
“How about dinner on
Saturday instead?”
“Yeah? I’m down. Can I
stay the night then?”
I had no idea how I was
going to manage it. I had to
trust that Eva would know
what to do. “That can be
arranged. Will you be okay
until then?”
“Jeez, listen to you.” She
laughed. “You sound like a
big brother. I’ll be fine. It was
just weird, you know, hearing
them going at it. It freaked
me out. Most people are
probably used to their parents
fighting, but I’m not.”
“They’ll be fine. All
couples fight eventually.” I
said the words, but I was both
uneasy and curious.
Eva couldn’t have been
right about Chris not
knowing. I found that
impossible to believe.
I’D just finished rolling up the
sleeves of my black dress
shirt when Eva stepped into
the reflection of the mirror. I
froze, my gaze raking over
her. She had chosen short
shorts, a sheer sleeveless
blouse, and high-heeled
sandals. She’d pulled her hair
up in its usual ponytail, but
she had done something to it
to make it look wild and
bedhead messy. Her eye
makeup was dark, her lips
pale. Big gold hoops hung
from her ears, and bangles
decorated her wrists.
I’d woken up to an angel. I
would be going to bed with a
different woman entirely.
I whistled in appreciation,
turning my back to the mirror
to take in the real deal. “You
look like a bad, bad girl.”
She wiggled her ass and
gave a cocky toss of her head.
“I am.”
“Come here.”
She eyed me. “I don’t think
so. You’ve got the fuck-me
look and we have to go.”
“We can be a little late.
What would it take to talk
you into wearing those shorts
just for me?”
I wanted others to want her
and know she was mine. I
also wanted to keep her all to
myself.
Her eyes took on a
calculating gleam. “We could
renegotiate the hand job.”
Remembering the deal
we’d struck—a quickie for a
clothed hand job—I realized
the shorts were going to make
the former a bit more difficult
than it could be. As for the
latter, I could work something
out.
Tilting my head in
agreement, I told her, “Put on
a skirt, angel, and let’s get
this party started.”
“WAS this your idea?” Arash
asked, when we met him
outside the ground-floor
entrance to the Starlight
Lounge.
Through the lobby glass, I
watched a bouncer oversee
the number of patrons
entering the elevator that
would take them to the
rooftop. Two more bouncers
stood guard at the exterior
door, holding back the
surging crowd hoping to get
in based on their looks, their
clothes, and/or their charm.
“It’s as much of a surprise
to me as it is to you.”
“I meant to tell you.” Eva
was literally hopping with
excitement. “Shawna’s heard
good things about this place
and I thought it’d be fun.”
“Great reviews online,”
Shawna said, “and some of
my regulars were raving
about it.”
Manuel checked out the
eager crowd behind the ropes,
while Megumi Kaba stood
cautiously between Cary and
Eva. Mark Garrity, Steven
Ellison, and Arnoldo all stood
back, keeping the way clear
for those whose names were
on the VIP List.
Cary slung his arm around
Megumi. “Stick with me,
kid.” He gave her a wide
smile. “We’ll show ’em how
it’s done.”
Eva grabbed my arm.
“Your surprise is here.”
I followed her gaze,
spotting a couple approaching
us. My brows rose when I
recognized Magdalene Perez.
Her hand was linked with that
of the man next to her and her
dark eyes were brighter than
I’d seen in a long time.
“Maggie,” I greeted her,
clasping her extended hand
and leaning down to kiss her
cheek. “I’m glad you came.”
Gladder still that Eva had
asked her. The two women
had gotten off to a rocky start,
which was entirely Maggie’s
fault. The rift between them
had strained my relationship
with Maggie in the weeks
since, and I’d been prepared
to accept that as an indefinite
state of affairs. It was nice,
however, that I didn’t have to.
Maggie grinned. “Gideon.
Eva. This is my boyfriend,
Gage Flynn.”
I took the man’s hand after
he shook Eva’s, noting the
strength of his grip and the
steady way he met my
perusal. He gave me a onceover,
too, but mine would be
more thorough. Before the
week was out, I would know
everything worth knowing
about the man. Maggie had
been through enough with
Christopher. I didn’t want to
see her hurt again.
“And here’s Will and
Natalie,” Eva said, as the last
of our group arrived.
Will Granger had a retro
beatnik look that worked for
him. His arm was snug
around the small blue-haired
woman next to him, who
dressed in the same fifties
style and sported twin sleeves
of tattoos.
While Eva made the
introductions, I nodded at the
bouncer to signal the arrival
of the final members of our
party. He held the line and
cleared the doorway for us.
My wife shot me a
suspicious glance. “Don’t tell
me you own this place.”
“Okay, I won’t.”
“You mean you do?”
My hand slid down her
back and rested lightly on the
curve of her hip. She’d
ditched the shorts in favor of
a fitted skirt with a split up
the back. I almost wished she
hadn’t changed. The shorts
had shown off her legs; the
skirt showed off her amazing
ass.
“You need to decide if you
want me to answer the
question or not,” I said, as we
made our way into the club.
The music was loud, the
amateur singer on the stage
louder. Strategic lighting
illuminated walkways and
tables while still allowing the
Manhattan nightscape to
dazzle patrons. Airconditioning
pumped out of
the walls and floors, cooling
the open air to a comfortable
temperature.
“Is there anything you
don’t own in New York?”
Arash laughed. “He
doesn’t own the D’Argos
Regal on Thirty-sixth
anymore.”
Eva stopped walking,
causing Arash to bump into
her from behind and send her
stumbling. I shot him a glare.
Grabbing my arm, Eva
yelled over the volume of the
crowded club. “You got rid of
the hotel?”
I looked down at her. The
wonder and hope on her face
more than made up for the
financial hit I’d taken. I
nodded.
She threw herself at me,
her arms twining around my
neck. She peppered my jaw
with quick, fierce kisses and I
smiled, my gaze meeting
Arash’s.
“And suddenly,” he said,
“it all makes sense.”

“GOD, THOSE TWO are so
sweet,” Shawna said,
watching Will and Natalie
sing “I Got You, Babe” on
the stage.
“They’re giving me
diabetes.” Manuel stood with
his drink. “Excuse me,
everyone. I see something
interesting.”
Gideon’s voice near my ear
was laced with amusement.
“Say good-bye, angel. We
won’t be seeing him again.”
I followed his line of sight
and saw a pretty brunette
giving Manuel a blatant onceover.
“Bye, Manuel!” I yelled
after him, waving. Then I
leaned into Gideon, who was
semisprawled on the
expensive leather upholstery.
“How come all the guys you
work with are hot?”
“Are they?” he drawled,
nuzzling my neck and along
the curve of my ear. “Maybe
they won’t be working with
me much longer.”
“Oh God.” I looked up at
the starry sky. “Whatever,
caveman.”
His arm tightened around
my hips, tugging me closer so
that I was pressed fully
against him from knee to
shoulder. Joy spread through
me. After all the crap we’d
been through the day before,
it was so awesome to just
enjoy each other.
Megumi leaned over the
low coffee table that filled the
center of the rectangular
seating area we occupied.
Bordered by two sectionals,
the VIP section held our
entire party comfortably.
“When are you getting up
there to make fools of
yourselves?” she asked.
“Um … never.”
It had taken a few drinks
and Cary’s undivided
attention to make Megumi
comfortable enough to enjoy
herself. My best friend had
kicked things off with a
rousing rendition of “Only
the Good Die Young,” and
then he’d dragged Megumi
up there to sing “(I’ve Had)
The Time of My Life.” She’d
come back to the table
glowing.
I owed Cary big-time for
taking care of her. Even
better, he seemed to have no
intention of ditching us to
cruise the place for conquests
like Manuel had. I was really
proud of him.
“Come on, Eva,” Steven
coaxed. “You picked this
place. You have to sing.”
“Your sister picked this
place,” I shot back, looking to
her. Shawna just shrugged
innocently.
“She’s sung twice!” he
countered.
I deflected. “Mark hasn’t
sung anything.”
My boss shook his head.
“I’m doing you all a favor,
trust me.”
“You’re telling me.
Squealing tires sound more
lyrical than I do!”
Arnoldo pushed the tablet
with the song choices my
way. It was the first time all
night he’d made any overture
toward me, aside from saying
hello at the entrance. He’d
spent most of the evening
focused on Magdalene and
Gage, which I tried not to
take as a personal snub.
“No fair,” I complained.
“You’re all ganging up on
me! Gideon hasn’t sung yet,
either.”
I glanced at my husband.
He shrugged. “I’ll go up if
you will.”
Astonishment widened my
eyes. I’d never heard Gideon
sing, had never even
imagined it. Singers exposed
and expressed emotion with
their voices. Gideon’s still
waters ran very deep.
“Hell, you gotta do it
now,” Cary said, reaching
over to tap the menu open at a
random page.
My stomach twisted a
little. I looked helplessly at
the songs in front of me. One
jumped out and I stared at it.
Taking a deep breath, I
stood. “Okay. Just remember,
you all asked for this. I don’t
want to hear any shit about
how bad I suck.”
Gideon, who’d risen to his
feet when I had, pulled me
close and murmured in my
ear, “I think you suck
excellently, angel.”
I elbowed him in the ribs.
His low laughter followed me
as I made my way to the
stage. I loved hearing that
sound, loved spending time
with him when we forgot our
troubles and had fun with
people who loved us. We
were married, but we still had
so much dating to catch up
on, so many nights with
friends yet to experience.
Tonight was just the first of
many, I hoped.
I regretted threatening the
fragile peace with my song
choice. But not enough to
change my mind.
I high-fived Will as he and
Natalie passed me on the way
back to our group. I could
have input my song choice
into the tablet at the table, the
same way we placed our food
and drink orders, but I didn’t
want Gideon seeing the title.
Plus, I’d noticed that every
other party in the place had to
wait for their turn in the
queue, but our selections
were fast-tracked. I was
hoping that adding my name
to the list in person would
buy me some time to build up
the courage I needed.
I should’ve known better.
When I gave the hostess my
selection, she typed it into the
system and said, “Okay, stay
right here. You’re next.”
“You’re kidding.” I
glanced back at our table.
Gideon winked at me.
Ooh, he was going to pay
for that later.
The chick on the stage
singing “Diamonds” wrapped
it up, and the place exploded
into applause. She’d been
decent, but really, the live
band made up for a lot of
faults. They were really good.
I had my fingers crossed that
they’d be good enough for
me, too.
I was shaking when I
climbed the short steps to the
stage. When the loud whistles
and cheers erupted from our
table, I couldn’t help but
laugh despite my
nervousness. I gripped the
mic in its stand and the beat
kicked in immediately. The
familiar song, one I loved,
gave me the boost I needed to
start.
Looking at Gideon, I
warbled my way through the
opening lyrics, telling him he
was amazing. Even over the
music, I could hear the
laughter at my horrible voice.
My own table erupted with it,
but I had expected that.
I’d chosen “Brave.” I had
to be it to sing it—that, or
crazy.
I stayed focused on my
husband, who wasn’t
laughing or smiling. He just
stared intently at my face as I
told him via Sara Bareilles’s
lyrics that I wanted to see him
speak up and be brave.
The catchy composition
plus the skill of the band
backing me began to win over
the crowd, who started
singing along, more or less.
My heart strengthened my
voice, giving power to the
message meant only for
Gideon.
He needed to stop holding
his silence. He needed to tell
his family the truth. Not for
me or for them, but for him.
When the song ended, my
friends surged to their feet in
applause and I grinned,
energized. I gave a lavish
bow and laughed when the
strangers at the tables in front
of the stage joined in the
unearned praise. I knew my
strengths. My singing voice
certainly wasn’t one of them.
“That was fuckin’
awesome!” Shawna shouted
when I got back to the table,
grabbing me in a fierce hug.
“You owned that, girl.”
“Remind me to pay you
later,” I said dryly, feeling my
face heat as the rest of our
party kicked in with praise.
“You guys are full of it.”
“Ah, baby girl,” Cary
drawled, his green eyes bright
with laughter, “you can’t be
good at everything. It’s a
relief to know you’re flawed
like the rest of us.”
I stuck my tongue out at
him and picked up the fresh
vodka cranberry sitting in
front of my spot.
“Your turn, lover boy,”
Arash goaded, grinning at
Gideon.
My husband nodded, then
looked at me. His face held
no hint to his thoughts, and I
began to worry. There was no
softness on his lips or in his
eyes, nothing to give me a
clue.
And then some idiot started
singing “Golden.”
Gideon stiffened, his jaw
visibly tightening. Reaching
for his hand, I gave it a
squeeze and felt a bit of relief
when he squeezed back.
He kissed my cheek and
headed to the stage, cutting
through the crowd with easy
command. I watched him go,
seeing other women’s heads
turn to follow him. I was
biased, of course, but knew
for a certainty that he was the
most striking man in the
room.
Seriously, it should be
criminal for a man to be that
sexy.
I looked at Arash and
Arnoldo. “Have either of you
heard him sing?”
Arnoldo shook his head.
Arash laughed. “Hell, no.
With any luck, he’ll sound
like you. Like Cary says, he
can’t be good at everything or
we’d all have to hate him.”
The guy onstage wrapped
it up. A moment later, Gideon
walked on. For some reason,
my heart started pounding as
badly as it had when I was up
there. My palms grew
clammy and I wiped them on
my skirt.
I was afraid of what it
would be like to watch
Gideon up there. Much as I
hated to think it, Brett was a
hard act to follow and hearing
“Golden,” even sung by
someone who shouldn’t ever
have access to a microphone,
brought those two worlds too
close together.
Gideon grabbed the mic
and pulled it off the stand as
if he’d done the move a
thousand times before. The
women in the audience went
crazy, yelling about how hot
he was and making
suggestive remarks I chose to
ignore. The man was
delicious physically, but his
commanding, confident
presence was the real kicker.
He looked like a man who
knew how to fuck a woman
senseless. And God, did he
ever.
“This one,” he said, “is for
my wife.”
With a pointed glance,
Gideon signaled the band to
start. An instantly
recognizable bass beat
ratcheted up my pulse.
“Lifehouse!” Shawna
crowed, clapping her hands.
“I love them!”
“He’s calling you his wife
already!” Megumi yelled,
leaning toward me. “How
freakin’ lucky are you?”
I didn’t glance at her. I
couldn’t. My attention was
riveted on Gideon as he
looked directly at me and
sang, telling me in a
lusciously raspy voice that he
was desperate for change and
starving for truth.
He was answering my
song.
My eyes burned even as
my heart began to beat with a
different rhythm. Had I
thought he’d be unemotional?
My God, he was killing me,
baring his soul in the rough
timbre of his voice.
“Holy fuck,” Cary said, his
eyes on the stage. “The man
can sing.”
I was hanging by a
moment, too, hanging on to
every word, hearing his
message about chasing after
me and falling more in love. I
shifted in my seat, turned on
beyond bearing.
Gideon dominated the
attention of everyone in the
bar. Of all the voices we’d
heard that night, his was truly
professional grade. He stood
in the single spotlight, feet set
a foot apart, dressed elegantly
while singing a rock song,
and he made it work so well I
couldn’t imagine it sung any
other way. There was no
comparison to Brett, not in
Gideon’s delivery or my
reaction to it.
I was on my feet before I
knew it, making my way
through the crowd to get to
him. Gideon finished the song
and the bar went ballistic,
cutting off my route to him. I
became lost in the crush, too
short to see beyond the
shoulders around me.
He found me, pushing his
way through to catch me up
in his arms. His mouth
claimed mine, kissing me
roughly, inciting a new round
of catcalls and cheers. In the
periphery, I heard the band
begin a new song. I
practically climbed up
Gideon, panting in his ear,
“Now!”
I didn’t have to explain.
Setting me down, he grabbed
my hand and led me across
the bar and back through the
kitchen to the service
elevator. I plastered myself
against him before the doors
closed behind us, but he was
pulling out his phone and
lifting it to his ear, tilting his
head back as my mouth slid
feverishly over his throat.
“Bring the limo around,”
he ordered gruffly, and then
the phone was back in his
pocket and he was kissing me
back with all the passion he’d
once kept locked inside.
Ravenous, I devoured him,
catching his lower lip
between my teeth and tasting
it with swift lashes of my
tongue. He groaned when I
pushed him against the
elevator’s padded wall, my
hands running down his chest
to cup the heft of his erection
in my palms.
“Eva … Christ.”
We stopped descending
and he exploded into
movement, grabbing me by
the elbow and pushing me
ahead of him out the doors
with brisk, impatient strides.
We exited from a service
hallway into the lobby, once
again maneuvering through a
crowd until we stepped out
into the summer night heat.
The limo idled in the street.
Angus jumped out, quickly
pulling the rear door open.
I scrambled in with Gideon
crowding in behind me.
“Don’t go far,” he told
Angus.
We settled onto the bench
seat with a foot of distance
between us, both of us
looking anywhere but at each
other as the privacy partition
slowly rose and the limo
began to move.
The moment the divider
locked into place, I fell back
against the seat and yanked
my skirt up, brazenly tearing
off my own clothes in my
eagerness to be fucked.
As Gideon dropped to his
knees on the floorboard, his
hands went to his waistband,
opening his slacks.
I shimmied out of my
underwear, kicking them off
along with my sandals.
“Angel.” His growl had me
moaning with anticipation.
“I’m wet. I’m wet,” I
chanted, not wanting him to
play with me or wait.
Still, he tested me, cupping
my sex in his hand. His
fingers parted me, stroking
over my clit, pushing inside
me.
“Jesus, Eva. You’re
soaked.”
“Let me ride you,” I
begged, pushing away from
the seat back. I wanted to set
the pace, the depth, the
rhythm …
Gideon pushed his pants
and boxer briefs down to his
knees, then sat on the bench,
yanking his shirttails out of
the way. His cock rose up
thick and long between his
thighs, as savagely beautiful
as the rest of him.
I slid down to kneel
between his legs, stroking his
penis with my hands. He was
hot and silky soft. My mouth
was on him before I
formulated the thought. His
breath hissed out between his
teeth, one hand grasping my
ponytail as his head fell back.
His eyes squeezed shut.
“Yes.”
I swirled my tongue around
the broad head, tasting him,
feeling the thick veins
throbbing against my palms.
Tightening my lips, I pulled
off, then sucked him back in.
He groaned and arched
upward, pushing into my
mouth. “Take it deep.”
I squirmed as I obeyed
him, ragingly turned on by
his pleasure. Gideon’s eyes
opened, his chin lowering so
he could take in the sight of
me.
“Come here.” The low
command sent a shiver of
desire through me.
I crawled up his
magnificent body, straddling
his hips and draping my arms
over his shoulders. “You are
so fucking hot.”
“Me? You’re burning up,
angel.”
I moved my hips to
position him. “Wait ’til you
feel me from the inside.”
He reached around me and
gripped his cock, holding
himself steady as I began to
sink down. My legs shook as
the thick crest of his penis
pushed inside me, stretching
me.
“Gideon.” The feeling of
being taken, possessed, was
one I never got over.
Gripping my hips, he
supported me. I took him
deeper, my eyes on his as
they grew heavy. A rumbling
sound filled the space
between us and I grew
slicker, hotter.
It didn’t matter how many
times I had him, I always
wanted more. More of the
way he responded to me, as if
nothing had ever felt the
same, as if I gave him
something he could get
nowhere else.
I clung to the back of the
seat and rolled my hips,
taking a little more. I could
feel him pressing against the
deepest part of me, but I
couldn’t fit all of him. I
wanted to. I wanted
everything he had.
“Our first time,” he said
hoarsely, watching me. “You
rode me right here, drove me
out of my mind. You blew the
top of my fucking head off.”
“It was so good,” I
breathed, dangerously close
to coming. He was so thick,
so hard. “Ah, God. It’s better
now.”
His fingers dug into my
hips. “I want you more now.”
Gasping, I pressed my
temple to his. “Help me.”
“Hold on.” Yanking my
hips down, he thrust upward,
shoving into me. “Take it,
Eva. Take it all.”
I cried out and ground into
him, moving on instinct,
taking the last of him.
“Yes … yes …” I gasped,
slamming my hips into his,
pumping my sex up and down
the rigid length of his
erection.
Gideon’s face was harsh
with lust, brutally etched with
his need. “I’m going to come
so hard for you,” he promised
darkly. “You’ll feel me in
you all night.”
The sound of his voice …
the way he’d looked onstage
… I’d never been so excited.
He wasn’t the only one who’d
be coming hard.
His head fell back against
the seat, his chest heaving,
harsh sounds of pleasure
scraping from his throat. His
hands released me, clenching
into fists against the seat. He
let me fuck him the way I
needed to, let me use him.
Arching back, I climaxed
with a cry, my entire body
shaking, my sex grasping,
rippling along his cock. My
rhythm faltered, my vision
blackened. An endless moan
poured out of me, the relief
dizzying.
The world shifted and I
was on my back, Gideon
rising over me, his arm
hooking beneath my left leg
to lift it to his shoulder. He
dug his feet into the
floorboard, thrusting again
and again, sinking deep. So
deep.
I writhed, the feel of him
so good it hurt.
He kept me pinned, opened
and defenseless, using me as
I’d used him, his control
shattered by the need to
orgasm. The power of his
body as he pounded into me,
the force with which he drove
his cock into my tender sex,
had me quivering on the
verge again.
“I love you,” I moaned, my
hands stroking down his
flexing thighs.
He growled my name and
started coming, his teeth
clenching, his hips pressed
tight to my own, screwing
deep. It set me off, the feel of
him coming inside me.
“So good,” he groaned,
rocking into the spasms of my
sex. We strained together,
grasping at each other.
He buried his face in my
throat. “Love you.”
Tears stung my eyes. He
said the words so rarely.
“Tell me again,” I begged,
holding on to him.
His mouth found mine. “I
love you …”
“MORE,” I demanded, licking
my lips.
Gideon glanced over his
shoulder at me. Bacon sizzled
in the pan in front of him and
my mouth watered for
another slice. “And here I’d
thought two packs of bacon
would last us all weekend.”
“Grease is a must after a
night of drinking,” I told him,
wiping some off my plate
with my fingertip and lifting
it to my mouth. “When
you’re not hung over, that is.”
“Which I am,” Cary
muttered, walking into the
kitchen in just his jeans,
which he hadn’t bothered
buttoning all the way. “Got
any beer?”
Gideon pointed at the
fridge with his tongs.
“Bottom drawer.”
I shook my head at my best
friend. “Hair of the dog this
morning?”
“Hell, yeah. My head feels
like it’s splitting in two.”
Cary pulled a beer out and
joined me at the island. He
popped the cap off and tipped
the bottle back, gulping down
half the contents at once.
“How’d you sleep?” I
asked, mentally crossing my
fingers.
He’d stayed the night in the
attached single-bedroom
apartment, and I hoped he
loved it. It had all the
beautiful prewar details of
Gideon’s penthouse and was
furnished similarly. I knew
Cary’s style was more
contemporary, but he
couldn’t fault the view of
Central Park. All the rest
could be changed, if he just
said the word.
He lowered the bottle from
his mouth. “Like the dead.”
“Do you like the
apartment?”
“Of course. Who
wouldn’t?”
“Do you want to live
there?” I persisted.
Cary gave me a lopsided
smile. “Yeah, baby girl. It’s a
dream. Thank you for the pity
fuck, Gideon.”
My husband turned away
from the stove with a plate of
bacon in his hand. “There is
neither pity nor fucking
included in the offer,” he said
dryly. “Otherwise, you’re
welcome.”
I clapped my hands. “Yay!
I’m stoked.”
Gideon snagged a piece of
bacon and stuck it in his
mouth. Leaning forward, I
parted my lips. He bent
toward me, letting me bite off
the end.
“Come on,” Cary groaned.
“I’m fighting nausea as it is.”
I shoved him gently. “Shut
up.” He grinned and finished his
beer. “Gotta give you guys a
hard time. Who else is going
to stop you two from singing
‘I Got You, Babe’ in a few
years?”
Thinking of Will and
Natalie made me smile. I’d
discovered even more to like
about Will and found that I
got along well with his girl,
too. “Aren’t they adorable?
They’ve been together since
high school.”
“Exactly my point,” he
drawled. “Spend enough
years with someone and
either you start bickering or
you fall down the loveydovey
hole, never to be seen
again.”
“Mark and Steven have
been together for years, too,”
I argued. “They don’t fight or
moon at each other.”
He shot me a look.
“They’re gay, Eva. No
estrogen in the mix to cause
drama.”
“Oh my God. You sexist
pig! You did not just say
that.”
Cary glanced at Gideon.
“You know I’m right.”
“And with that,” Gideon
declared, grabbing three
strips of bacon, “I’m out.”
“Hey!” I complained after
him, as he exited to the living
room.
My best friend laughed.
“Don’t worry. He hitched
himself to your brand of
female.”
I glared at him as I
munched another piece of
bacon. “I’m giving you a
pass, because I owe you for
last night.”
“It was fun. Megumi’s
good people.” His humor
fled, his face darkening. “I’m
sorry she’s going through
what she is.”
“Yeah, me, too.”
“You make any decisions
about how you’re going to
help others like her?”
I set my elbows on the
island. “I’m going to talk to
Gideon about working with
his Crossroads Foundation.”
“Hell. Why didn’t you
think of that before?”
“Because … I’m stubborn,
I guess.” I glanced over my
shoulder at the living room,
then lowered my voice. “One
of the things Gideon likes
about me is that I don’t
always do everything he
wants just because he wants
it. He’s not like Stanton.”
“And you don’t want to be
like your mom. Does this
mean you’re keeping your
maiden name?”
“No way. It means a lot to
Gideon for me to become Eva
Cross. Besides, it sounds
kick-ass.”
“It does.” He tapped the
end of my nose with his
finger. “I’m here for you
when you need me.”
Sliding off the stool, I
hugged him. “Same goes.”
“I’m taking you up on that,
obviously.” His chest heaved
with a deep sigh. “Big
changes happening, baby girl.
You ever get scared?”
I looked up at him, feeling
the affinity that had gotten us
both through some hard
times. “More than I let myself
think about.”
“I have to run to the
office,” Gideon interjected,
stepping back into the kitchen
wearing a Yankees ball cap.
He’d kept the same gray Tshirt
on but had swapped out
his pajama bottoms for
sweats. A ring of keys twirled
around his finger. “I won’t be
long.”
“Is everything all right?” I
asked, backing away from
Cary. My husband was
wearing his game face, the
one that told me his mind was
already on whatever he was
going to deal with.
“Everything’s fine.” He
came to me and gave me a
quick kiss. “I’ll be back in a
couple of hours. Ireland
won’t be here ’til six.”
He left. I stared after him.
What was important
enough to drag him away
from me on a weekend?
Gideon was possessive about
a lot of things when it came
to me, but our time together
topped the list. And the keytwirling
thing was kind of
weird. Gideon wasn’t a man
given to wasted movement.
The only times I’d seen him
fidget were when he was
completely relaxed or the
opposite—ready to throw
down.
I couldn’t shake the feeling
that he was hiding something
from me. As usual.
“I’m gonna take a shower,”
Cary said, grabbing a bottled
water out of the fridge. “You
want to watch a movie when I
get out?”
“Sure,” I said absently.
“Sounds like a plan.”
I waited until he’d gone
back into the attached
apartment, then went to find
my phone.

11
“WHERE’S EVA?”
I rounded the front of the
Benz and stepped onto the
curb in front of Brett Kline.
My fingers twitched, the habit
of extending my hand in
greeting ruthlessly
suppressed. The singer’s
hands had touched my wife
intimately in the past … and
recently. I didn’t want to
shake them. I wanted to break
them.
“At our home,” I answered,
gesturing at the entrance to
the Crossfire Building. “Let’s
go up to my office.”
Kline smiled coldly. “You
can’t keep me from her.”
“You did that all by
yourself.” I noted the worn
Pete’s T-shirt he was wearing
with black jeans and leather
boots. Without a doubt, his
choice of attire wasn’t a
coincidence. He wanted to
remind Eva of their history
together. Maybe even remind
me, too. Had Yimara given
him the idea? I wouldn’t be
surprised.
It was the wrong move for
both men to have made.
He walked through the
revolving doors ahead of me.
Security took his information
and printed out a temporary
ID, then we headed through
the turnstiles to the elevators.
“You can’t intimidate me
with your money,” he said
tightly.
I entered the car and hit the
button for the top floor.
“There are eyes and ears all
over the city. At least in my
office, I know we won’t be
putting on a show.”
His lip curled in disgust.
“Is that all you care about?
Public perception?”
“An ironic question,
considering who you are and
what you want.”
“Don’t act like you know
me,” he growled. “You know
shit.”
In the confined space of the
elevator car, Kline’s
aggression and frustration
permeated the space between
us. His hands gripped the
handrail behind him, his
stance hostile and expectant.
From the platinum tips of his
spiked hair to the black-andgray
tattoos covering his
arms, the front man of Six-
Ninths couldn’t be more
different from me in
appearance. I used to feel
threatened by that and his
history with Eva, but no
longer.
Not after San Diego. And
certainly not after last night.
I could still feel the marks
of Eva’s nails in my back and
ass. She’d pushed me to my
limits all night and into the
early hours of the morning.
The insatiable hunger she felt
for me left no room for
anyone else. And the catch in
her voice when she told me
she loved me, the sheen of
tears in her eyes when I
yielded to what she did to me
…
I leaned back against the
opposite wall and tucked my
hands into the pockets of my
sweats, knowing my
nonchalance would goad him.
“Does she know we’re
meeting like this?” he asked
harshly.
“I figured I’d leave it up to
you to decide whether to
mention it.”
“Oh, I’m mentioning it all
right.”
“I hope you do.”
We exited into the Cross
Industries foyer and I led him
through the security doors
and back to my office. There
were a few people at their
desks and I took note of them.
Those who worked on their
days off weren’t always
better employees than those
who didn’t, but I respected
ambition and rewarded it.
When we got to my office,
I shut the doors behind us and
frosted the glass. A folder sat
on my desk, as I’d instructed
before leaving the penthouse.
I set my hand atop it and
gestured for Kline to take a
seat.
He remained standing.
“What the fuck is this about?
I come into town to see Eva
and your goon brings me here
instead.”
The “goon” was security
provided by Vidal Records,
but he wasn’t wrong in
thinking the man worked for
me. “I’m prepared to offer
you a great deal of money—
along with other incentives—
for the exclusive rights to the
Yimara footage of you and
Eva.”
He gave me a hard smile.
“Sam told me you were going
to try this. That tape is none
of your business. It’s between
me and Eva.”
“And the entire world if it
leaks, and that would destroy
her. Does that matter to you
at all, how she feels about it?”
“It’s not going to leak, and
of course I give a shit about
how she feels. It’s one of the
reasons we need to talk.”
I nodded. “You want to ask
her what you can use. You
think you can talk her into
letting you exploit some of
it.”
He rocked back on his feet,
a restless move that signaled
a direct hit.
“You’re not going to get
the answer you hope for,” I
told him. “The very existence
of that tape horrifies her.
You’re an idiot if you think
otherwise.”
“It’s not all sex. There’s
some good stuff of us
hanging out. Her and I, we
had something. She wasn’t
just a lay to me.”
Piece of shit. I had to
control the impulse to deck
him.
He smirked. “Not that
you’d understand. You had
no problem banging away at
that brunette until I came
back into the picture, then
you changed up your game.
Eva’s a toy you got bored
with. Until someone else
wanted her.”
His mention of Corinne hit
a harsh chord. The charade of
dating my ex had nearly cost
me Eva, a close call that still
haunted me.
That didn’t prevent me
from noticing how good he
was at shifting the blame.
“Eva knows what she means
to me.”
He stepped closer to my
desk. “She’s too blinded by
your billions to realize there’s
something really wrong with
you hiding that bogus
wedding in a foreign country.
Is it even legal?”
It was a question I’d
anticipated. “Absolutely
legal.”
Opening the folder, I
pulled out the photo inside. It
was taken on the day of my
wedding, at the very moment
I first kissed Eva as her
husband. The beach and the
pastor who had officiated at
the ceremony were behind us.
I cupped her face, our lips
touching softly. Her hands
held my wrists, my ring
sparkling on her finger.
I turned the picture around
so that it faced him. I slid a
copy of the marriage license
into place beside it. I used my
left hand, proudly displaying
my ruby-encrusted wedding
band.
I wasn’t sharing such
personal things to prove a
point. I intended to provoke
Kline, which I’d been
deliberately doing from the
moment he arrived in New
York. When he reached out to
my wife again, I wanted him
off-balance and at a
disadvantage.
“So you and Eva are
done,” I said evenly. “If you
doubted it, now you know it
for sure. In any case, I don’t
think you want my wife as
much as you want the
memory of her for the band’s
use.”
Kline laughed. “Yeah,
paint me as the sleaze. You
can’t handle the thought of
her seeing that tape. You’ve
never made her get that wild
and you never will.”
My forearms twitched with
the need to pound the
smugness out of his face.
“Believe what you like. Here
are your options: You can
take the two million I’m
offering, give me the footage,
and walk away—”
“I don’t want your damn
money!” Setting his hands on
the edge of my desk, he
leaned toward me. “You
don’t get to own my
memories. You may have her
—for now—but I have those.
Fuck if I’m selling them to
you.”
The thought of Kline
watching the footage …
watching himself fuck my
wife … set my blood on a
slow boil. The thought of him
suggesting that Eva sit
through a viewing of it,
knowing how that would
shatter her, pushed me to the
raw edge of violence.
Keeping my tone even was
a struggle. “You can reject
the money and keep the
existence of the footage to
yourself until you die. Make
it a secret gift to Eva she
never has to know about.”
“What the fuck are you
talking about?”
“Or you can be a selfish
asshole,” I continued, “and
hit her up with it, shocking
her with the goal of
destroying her marriage and
making yourself more
famous.”
I stared him down. Kline
stood his ground, but his gaze
dropped for a fraction of a
second. A small victory, for
what it was worth.
With a swipe of my hand, I
withdrew the contract Arash
had drawn up. “If you care
about her at all, you’ll make a
different decision than the
one that brought you to New
York.”
He grabbed the documents
off my desk and ripped them
in half, throwing the pieces
back onto the glass. “I’m not
leaving until I see her.”
Kline strode out of my
office, bristling with anger.
I watched him go. Then I
placed a call via a secure line.
“Did I give you enough
time?”
“Yes. We took care of the
laptop and tablet in his
luggage as soon as you took
him upstairs. We’re handling
his e-mail and backup
provider servers as we speak,
and the backups to those
servers. We searched his
residence over the weekend,
but he hasn’t been there in
weeks. We cleaned
everything on both Yimara
and Kline’s equipment, as
well as the accounts and
equipment of those who
received teasers of the fulllength
footage. One of the
execs at Vidal had a full copy
on his hard drive, but we
wiped it. We found no
evidence that he forwarded it
anywhere.”
Ice slid through my veins.
“Which executive?”
“Your brother.”
Fuck. I gripped the edge of
my desk so hard my knuckles
cracked with the strain. I
remembered the video of
Christopher with Magdalene,
knew how perverse his hatred
toward me was. Thinking
about him seeing Eva so
intimately … so vulnerable
… took me to a place I hadn’t
been since I’d first heard
about Nathan.
I had to believe that the
private military security firm
I’d hired had dealt with the
situation thoroughly. Their
tech teams were trained to
handle far more sensitive
information.
I shoved the mess on my
desk into the folder. “I need
that footage to cease to exist
anywhere.”
“Understood. We’re on it.
Still, it’s possible there’s a
hard copy floating around,
although we’ve searched
Kline and Yimara’s
transaction records for
security deposit boxes and the
like. We’ll continue to
monitor the situation until
you say otherwise.”
I never would. I’d search
for a lifetime, if that was what
it took, for any hint that the
footage survived somewhere
outside of my control. “Thank
you.”
Hanging up, I left my
office and headed home to
Eva.
“YOU’RE really good with
those,” Ireland said, eyeing
Eva as she lifted a
chopstickful of kung pao
chicken from its white box to
her mouth. “I never got the
hang of ’em.”
“Here, try holding them
like this.”
I watched my wife adjust
my sister’s grip on the slender
sticks, her blond head a bright
contrast against Ireland’s
black hair. Sitting on the floor
at my feet, they both wore
shorts and tank tops, their
tanned legs stretched out
beneath the coffee table, one
long and lean, the other petite
and voluptuous.
I was more of an observer
than a participant, sitting on
the couch behind them and
envying their easy rapport
even while I was grateful for
it.
It was all so surreal. I
hadn’t ever imagined a night
like that, a quiet evening at
home with … family. I didn’t
know how to contribute or
even if I could. What could I
say? How should I feel?
Besides awed. And
thankful. So very thankful for
my amazing wife, who
brought so much to my life.
Not long ago, on a similar
Saturday night, I would have
been at a highly publicized
social function or event,
focusing on business unless
or until a woman’s keen
interest spurred a need to
fuck. Whether I returned to
the penthouse by myself or
ended up at the hotel with a
one-night stand, I’d be alone.
And since I hardly
remembered what it felt like
to belong anywhere, to
anyone, I didn’t know what I
was missing.
“Ha! Look at that,” Ireland
crowed, holding up a tiny bit
of orange chicken, which she
promptly ate. “Made it to my
mouth.”
I swallowed the wine in my
glass in a single gulp,
wanting to say something. My
mind raced with options, all
of which sounded insincere
and contrived. In the end
what came out was, “The
chopsticks have a large target.
Ups your chances.”
Ireland turned her head
toward me, revealing the
same blue eyes I saw in the
mirror every day. They were
much less guarded, far more
innocent, and bright with
laughter and adoration. “Did
you just call me a big
mouth?”
Unable to resist, I ran my
hand over the crown of her
head, touching the silky soft
strands of her hair. Those,
too, were like mine and yet
not. “Not my words,” I said.
“Not in so many words,”
she corrected, leaning briefly
into my touch before turning
back to Eva.
Eva glanced up at me,
offering an encouraging
smile. She knew I drew
strength from her, and she
gave it unconditionally.
My throat tight, I rose from
the couch and grabbed Eva’s
empty wineglass. Ireland’s
glass of soda was still half
full, so I left it and headed to
the kitchen, trying to regain
enough equanimity to make it
through the rest of the
evening.
“Channing Tatum is so
hot,” Ireland said, her voice
traveling from the living
room. “Don’t you think?”
I frowned. My baby sister’s
idle question triggered
uncomfortable thoughts of
her dating. She had to have
started a few years ago—she
was seventeen. I knew it was
unrealistic to want her to stay
away from boys. I knew it
was my fault that I’d missed
so much of her childhood.
But the thought of her having
to deal with younger versions
of men like me and Manuel
and Cary roused an
unfamiliar defensive reaction.
“He’s very good-looking,”
Eva agreed.
Possessiveness rose to join
the mix. My gaze narrowed
on the two glasses in front of
me as I refilled them.
“He’s this year’s Sexiest
Man Alive,” Ireland said.
“Look at those biceps.”
“Ah, now on that, I have to
totally disagree. Gideon is
way sexier.”
My mouth curved.
“You’re such a goner,” my
sister teased. “Your pupils
turn into little hearts when
you think about Gideon. It’s
so cute.”
“Shut up.”
Ireland’s musical laugh
floated through the air.
“Don’t worry. He’s goofy
over you, too. And he’s been
on every Sexiest Man Alive
list for ages. I never hear the
end of it from my friends.”
“Gah. Don’t tell me stuff
like that. I’m jealous by
nature.”
Laughing inwardly, I
dropped the empty bottle into
the recycling bin.
“So is Gideon. He’s going
to flip out when you start
hitting the Hottest Women
Alive lists. No way to avoid it
now that everyone’s heard of
you.”
“Whatever,” Eva scoffed.
“They’d have to Photoshop
fifteen pounds off my ass and
thighs to sell that.”
“Um, have you seen Kim
Kardashian? Or Jennifer
Lopez?”
I paused on the threshold
of the living room, taking in
the picture Ireland and Eva
made over the rim of my
glass. An ache bloomed in
my chest. I wanted to freeze
the moment, protect it, keep it
safe forever.
Ireland looked up and
spotted me, then rolled her
eyes. “What did I tell you?”
she said. “Goofy.”
SITTING back in my chair, I
sipped coffee and studied the
spreadsheet on my monitor. I
rolled my shoulders back,
trying to loosen the kink in
my neck.
“Dude. What the hell? It’s
three in the morning.”
I looked up to find Ireland
standing in the doorway to
my home office. “Your
point?”
“Why are you working so
late?”
“Why are you Skyping so
late?” I countered, having
heard her laughter and
occasionally raised voice over
the last hour or so since I’d
left Eva sleeping.
“Whatev,” she muttered,
coming in and dropping into
one of the chairs in front of
my desk. She slouched, her
shoulders even with the chair
back and her legs sprawled
out in front of her. “Can’t
sleep?”
“No.” She didn’t know
how literally true that was.
With Ireland sleeping in
Eva’s bed and Eva sleeping in
mine, I couldn’t risk going to
sleep myself. There was only
so much I could expect Eva
to take, only so many times I
could frighten her before it
destroyed the love she felt for
me.
“Christopher texted me a
bit ago,” she said. “Guess
Dad’s staying at a hotel.”
My brows rose.
She nodded, her face
forlorn. “It’s bad, Gideon.
They haven’t spent a night
apart ever. At least that I can
remember.”
I didn’t know what to say.
Our mother had been calling
me all day, leaving messages
on my voice mail and ringing
the penthouse so often I’d
been forced to disconnect the
main receiver so that none of
the phones would ring. I
hated that my mother was
struggling, but I had to
protect my time with Ireland
and Eva.
It felt heartless to focus on
myself, but I’d already lost
my family twice before—
once when my father died and
again after Hugh. I couldn’t
afford to lose any more. I
didn’t think I could survive it
a third time, not with Eva in
my life.
“I just wish I knew what
caused the fight,” she said. “I
mean as long as they didn’t
cheat on each other, they
should be able to get through
it, right?”
Exhaling roughly, I
straightened. “I’m not the
person to ask about
relationships. I have no idea
how they work. I’m just
stumbling my way through,
praying not to fuck things up,
and grateful that Eva is so
forgiving.”
“You really love her.”
I followed her gaze to the
collage of photos on the wall.
It hurt sometimes, looking at
those pictures of my wife. I
wanted to recapture and
relive every moment. I
wanted to hoard every second
I’d ever had with her. I hated
that time slipped away so
quickly and I couldn’t bank it
for the uncertain future.
“Yes,” I murmured. I’d
forgive Eva anything. There
was nothing she could do or
say that would break us apart,
because I couldn’t live
without her.
“I’m happy for you,
Gideon.” Ireland smiled when
I looked at her.
“Thank you.” The worry in
her eyes lingered and sparked
restlessness. I wanted to fix
the problems troubling her,
but I didn’t know how.
“Could you talk to Mom?”
she suggested. “Not now, of
course. But tomorrow?
Maybe you can find out
what’s going on?”
I hesitated a moment,
knowing a conversation with
our mother was certain to be
unproductive. “I’ll try.”
Ireland studied her nails.
“You don’t like Mom very
much, do you?”
Weighing my answer
carefully, I said, “We have a
fundamental difference of
opinion.”
“Yeah. I get it. It’s like
she’s got this weird form of
OCD that applies to her
family. Everyone has to be a
particular way or at least
pretend to be. She’s so
worried about what people
think. I saw an old movie the
other day that reminded me of
her. Ordinary People. Ever
seen it?”
“No, can’t say I have.”
“You should watch it. It
has Kiefer Sutherland’s dad
in it and some other people.
It’s sad, but it’s a good
story.”
“I’ll look it up.” Feeling
the need to explain our
mother, I tried my best.
“What she dealt with after my
father died … It was brutal.
She’s insulated herself since
then, I think.”
“My friend’s mother says
Mom used to be different
before. You know, when she
was married to your dad.”
I set my cooled coffee
aside. “I do remember her
differently.”
“Better?”
“That’s subjective. She
was more … spontaneous.
Carefree.”
Ireland rubbed at her
mouth with her fingertips.
“Do you think it broke her?
Losing your dad?”
My chest tightened. “It
changed her,” I said quietly.
“I’m not sure how much.”
“Ugh.” She sat up, visibly
shaking off her melancholy.
“You going to be awake
awhile?”
“Probably all night.”
“Wanna watch that movie
with me?”
The suggestion surprised
me. And pleased me.
“Depends. You can’t tell me
what happens. No spoilers.”
She shot me a look. “I
already told you it’s sad. If
you want happily ever after,
she’s sleeping down the hall.”
That made me smile.
Standing, I rounded my desk.
“You find the movie, I’ll grab
the soda.”
“A beer would be good.”
“Not on my watch.”
She pushed to her feet with
a grin. “Okay, fine. Wine,
then.”
“Ask me again in a few
years.”
“You’ll have kids by then.
It won’t be as fun.”
I paused, hit by anxiety
sharp enough to mist my skin
with sweat. The thought of
having a baby with Eva both
thrilled and terrified me. It
wasn’t safe for my wife to
live with me. How could it
ever be safe for a child?
Ireland laughed. “Holy
fuck, you should see your
face! A classic case of
playboy panic. Didn’t they
tell you? First comes love,
then comes marriage, then
comes the baby in the baby
carriage.”
“If you don’t shut up, I’m
sending you to bed.”
She laughed harder and
linked her arm with mine.
“You’re a riot. Seriously. I’m
just messing with you. Don’t
flip out on me. I’ve got
enough family members
doing that.”
I willed my heart to stop
pounding so damn hard.
“Maybe you should have a
drink,” she suggested.
“I think I will,” I muttered.
“I’m going to give major
props to Eva for getting a ring
out of you. Did you have a
panic attack when you
proposed, too?”
“Stop talking, Ireland.”
Leaning her head against
my shoulder, she giggled and
led me out of my office.
THE sun had been up for over
two hours by the time I
returned to bed. I stripped
silently, my gaze roaming
over the delectable bump
under the covers that was my
wife.
Eva was curled in a ball,
mostly hidden except for the
bright strands of hair splayed
over the pillow. My mind
filled in the blanks, knowing
she was naked between the
sheets.
Mine. All mine.
It killed me to sleep away
from her. I knew it hurt her,
too. Lifting the edge of the
blankets, I slid in beside her.
She gave a soft little moan
and rolled toward me, her
lush warm body wriggling
into place against me.
I was instantly hard. Desire
simmered in my blood;
awareness tingled along my
skin. It was combustible
sexual chemistry but also
something more. Something
deeper. A strange, wonderful,
frightening recognition.
She filled an emptiness in
me I hadn’t known was there.
Eva buried her face in my
throat and hummed softly, her
legs tangling with mine, her
hands gliding over my back.
“Hard and yummy all over,”
she purred.
“All over,” I agreed,
cupping her ass and pulling
her tighter against my hardon.
Her shoulders shook with a
silent laugh. “We have to be
quiet.”
“I’ll cover your mouth.”
“Me?” She nipped at my
throat. “You’re the noisy
one.”
She wasn’t wrong. As
rough and impatient as I
could get when aroused, I’d
never been loud … until her.
It was a struggle to be
discreet when situations
called for it. She felt too
good, made me feel too
much.
“So we’ll take it slow,” I
murmured, my hands
roaming greedily over her
silky skin. “Ireland will be
sleeping for hours; there’s no
rush.”
“Hours, huh?” Laughing,
she pulled back and rolled
away from me, reaching for
the nightstand drawer.
“Overachiever.”
Tension stretched across
my shoulders as she dug out
the breath mints she kept
handy. I was reminded of
similar situations, when
women had reached into the
nightstand drawer for
condoms.
Eva and I had used
condoms only twice. Before
her, I’d never fucked a
woman without one.
Avoiding pregnancy was
something I’d religiously
adhered to.
Yet since those first two
times with Eva, we’d gone
bare, relying on her birth
control to prevent conception.
It was a risk. I knew that.
And considering how often I
had her—at least two,
sometimes three or four times
a day—the risk was not
inconsiderable.
I thought of it sometimes. I
questioned my control, my
selfishness in putting my own
pleasure above the
consequences. But the reason
for my recklessness wasn’t as
simple as pleasure. If it were,
I could deal. Be responsible.
No, it was much more
complicated.
The need to come inside
her was primitive. It was a
conquest and surrender in
one.
I had wanted to fuck her
raw before I’d even had her
the first time, before I knew
definitively how explosive it
would be between us. I’d
gone so far as to warn her
prior to our first date that I
needed it, needed her to give
me that, something I’d never
wanted with anyone else.
“Don’t move,” I said
roughly, sliding over her
while she was still stretched
out on her stomach. My hand
pushed between her hip and
the bed, reaching between her
legs to cup her cunt in my
palm. She was moist and
warm. My stroking fingers
made her slick and hot.
She muffled a moan.
“I want you just like this,”
I told her, brushing my lips
across her cheek.
Reaching for my pillow
with my free hand, I yanked it
over and then shoved it under
her, lifting her hips to an
angle that would let me sink
balls-deep.
“Gideon …” The way she
said my name was a plea, as
if I wouldn’t get down on my
knees and beg for the
privilege of having her.
I shifted, urging her legs
apart and pinning her wrists
beside her head. Holding her
down, I thrust into her. She
was ready for me, plush and
tight and wet. My teeth
gritted together to restrain the
growl that surged from my
throat, a tremor racking my
body from head to toe. My
chest heaved against her
back, my violent exhalations
ruffling her hair lying across
the pillow.
Just like that, just by taking
me, she had me right on the
edge.
“God.” My hips churned
without volition, screwing my
cock into her, pushing me
deeper until I was in her to
the hilt. I could feel her all
around me, from root to tip,
clenching in ripples that
milked me like a greedy little
mouth. “Angel—”
The pressure at the base of
my dick was insistent, but I
was capable of staving it off.
It wasn’t a question of
control, but of will.
I wanted to come inside
her. Wanted it enough to
consider the risk—as
terrifying as it was—
acceptable.
Closing my eyes, I dropped
my forehead to her cheek. I
inhaled the scent of her and
let go, coming hard, my ass
flexing as I filled her up in
thick, hot spurts.
Eva whimpered, writhing
under me. Her cunt tightened,
then trembled around my
cock. She climaxed with a
soft, sweet moan.
I growled her name,
searingly aroused by her
orgasm. She came because I
did, because my pleasure
turned her on as much as my
touch. I would reward her for
that, show her the depth of
my gratitude. She would get
hers, over and over again, as
many times as she could take
it.
“Eva.” I rubbed my damp
cheek against hers.
“Crossfire.”
Her fingers tightened their
grip on mine. Her head
turned, her lips seeking.
“Ace,” she breathed into
the kiss. “I love you, too.”
IT was shortly after five in the
evening when I drove the
Bentley through the gates of
the Vidal estate in Dutchess
County and into the circular
drive out front.
“Aw, you drove too fast,”
Ireland complained from the
backseat. “We’re here
already.”
I put the SUV in park and
left it idling. One look at the
house, and a knot tightened in
my gut. Eva reached over,
taking my hand and giving it
a squeeze. I focused on her
steely gray eyes instead of the
Tudor-style mansion at her
back.
She didn’t say a word, but
she didn’t have to. I felt her
love and support and saw the
glimmer of anger in her eyes.
Just knowing she understood
gave me strength. She knew
every dark and dirty secret I
had, and yet she believed and
loved me anyway.
“I want to stay over again
sometime,” Ireland said,
poking her head between the
two front seats. “It was fun,
right?”
I looked at her. “We’ll do it
again.”
“Soon?”
“All right.”
Her smile more than made
the promise worth what it
would cost me in sleep and
anxiety. I’d stayed away from
her for many reasons, but the
main one was that I didn’t
know what I could offer her
of any value. I’d channeled
everything into keeping Vidal
Records afloat for her well
into the future, taking care of
her the only way I knew I
wouldn’t screw up.
“You’ll have to help me
out,” I told her honestly. “I
don’t know how to be a
brother. You will probably
have to forgive me.
Frequently.”
The smile left Ireland’s
face, transforming her from a
teenager to a young woman.
“Well, it’s like being a
friend,” she said somberly.
“Except you have to
remember birthdays and
holidays, you have to forgive
me for everything, and you
should introduce me to all
your hot, rich guy friends.”
My brow lifted. “Where’s
the part about me picking on
you and giving you a hard
time?”
“You missed those years,”
she shot back. “No do-overs.”
She meant to tease, but the
words struck home. I had
missed years and I couldn’t
get them back.
“You get to pick on her
boyfriends instead,” Eva said,
“and give them a hard time.”
Our eyes met and I knew
she understood exactly what I
was thinking. My thumb
stroked over her knuckles.
Behind her, the front door
opened and my mother
stepped out. She stood on the
wide top step dressed in a
white tunic and matching
pants. Her long, dark hair
hung loosely around her
shoulders. From a distance,
she looked so much like
Ireland, more of a sister than
a parent.
My grip on Eva’s hand
tightened.
Ireland sighed and opened
her door. “I wish you guys
didn’t have to work
tomorrow. I mean, what’s the
point of being a gazillionaire
if you can’t play hooky when
you want?”
“If Eva worked with me,” I
said, looking at my wife, “we
could.”
She stuck her tongue out.
“Don’t start.”
I lifted her hand to my
mouth and kissed the back. “I
haven’t stopped.”
Opening my door, I
stepped out of the car and hit
the hatch release. I rounded
the back of the car to retrieve
Ireland’s bag and found my
arms full of her instead. She
hugged me tightly, her
slender arms wrapped around
my waist. It took me a
moment to unfreeze from my
surprise, and then I hugged
her back, my cheek coming to
rest on the crown of her head.
“I love you,” she mumbled
into my chest. “Thanks for
having me over.”
My throat closed tight,
preventing me from saying
anything. She was gone as
quickly as she’d come at me,
her duffel in hand as she met
Eva on the passenger side and
hugged her, too.
Feeling as winded as if I’d
been punched, I closed the
hatch and watched as my
mother met Ireland halfway
across the blue-gray gravel
drive. I was about to return to
the wheel and leave, when
she signaled at me to wait.
I glanced at Eva. “Get in
the car, angel.”
She looked as if she might
argue, and then she nodded
and slid back into the front
passenger seat and closed the
door.
I waited until my mother
came to me.
“Gideon.” She caught me
by the biceps and lifted onto
her tiptoes to press a kiss to
my mouth. “Won’t you and
Eva come in? You drove all
this way.”
I took a step backward,
breaking her hold. “And we
have to drive back.”
Her gaze reflected her
disappointment. “Just for a
few minutes. Please. I’d like
to apologize to both of you. I
haven’t handled the news of
your engagement well and
I’m sorry about that. This
should be a happy time for
our family, and I’m afraid
I’ve been too worried about
losing my son to appreciate
it.”
“Mom.” I caught her arm
when she moved toward the
passenger side. “Not now.”
“I didn’t mean all those
things I said about Eva the
other day. It was just a shock,
seeing the ring your father
gave me on another woman’s
hand. You didn’t give the
ring to Corinne, so I was
surprised. You can
understand that, can’t you?”
“You antagonized Eva.”
“Is that what she told
you?” She paused. “I never
meant to, but—Never mind.
Your father was very
protective, too. You’re so like
him.”
I looked away, gazing
absently at the trees beyond
the drive. I never knew how
to take comparisons to
Geoffrey Cross. Were they
meant as praise or a
backhanded compliment?
There was no telling with my
mother.
“Gideon … please, I’m
trying. I said some things to
Eva I shouldn’t have, and she
responded as any woman
would under the
circumstances. I just want to
smooth things over.” She set
her hand over my heart. “I’m
happy for you, Gideon. And
I’m so glad to see you and
Ireland spending time
together. I know it means so
much to her.”
I pulled her hand away
gently. “It means a lot to me,
too. And Eva made it possible
in ways I won’t explain.
Which is just one of the
reasons I won’t have her
upset. Not now. She has to
work in the morning.”
“Let’s make plans for
lunch this week, then. Or
dinner.”
“Will Chris be there?” Eva
asked through the window
before pushing the door open
again and stepping out. She
stood there, so small and
bright against the dark
hulking SUV, formidable in
the way her shoulders were
set.
My wife would fight the
world for me. It was
miraculous to know that.
When no one else had fought
for me, I’d somehow found
the one soul who would.
My mother’s lips curved.
“Of course. Chris and I are a
team.”
I noted the brittleness of
her smile and doubted her, as
I so often did. Still, I
conceded. “We’ll make plans.
Call Scott tomorrow and
we’ll work something out.”
My mother’s face
brightened. “I’m so glad.
Thank you.”
She hugged me and I
braced myself, my body stiff
with the need to push her
away. When she approached
Eva with her arms
outstretched, Eva thrust out
her hand between them to
shake instead. The interaction
was awkward, with both
women so obviously on the
defensive.
My mother didn’t want to
mend fences; she wanted an
agreement to pretend the
fences were sound.
We said good-bye, and
then I slid into the driver’s
seat. Eva and I took off,
leaving the estate behind us.
We hadn’t gone far when she
said, “When did your mother
talk to you?”
Damn it. I knew what that
bite in her tone signified.
Reaching over, I set my
hand on her knee. “I don’t
want you worrying about my
mother.”
“You don’t want me
worrying about anything!
That’s not the way this is
gonna work. You don’t get to
deal with all the crap alone.”
“What my mother says or
does isn’t important, Eva. I
don’t give a shit and neither
should you.”
She twisted in the seat to
face me. “You need to start
sharing stuff. Especially
things that have to do with
me, like your mother saying
things behind my back!”
“I won’t have you getting
pissed off over an irrelevant
opinion.” The road curved. I
accelerated out of the turn.
“That would be better than
me getting pissed off at you!”
she snapped. “Pull over.”
“What?” I glanced at her.
“Pull the damn car over!”
Cursing inwardly, I
removed my hand from her
leg and gripped the wheel.
“Tell me why.”
“Because I’m mad at you,
and you’re sitting there
looking all hot and sexy
driving and you need to
stop.”
Amusement warred with
exasperation. “Stop what?
Looking hot and sexy? Or
driving?”
“Gideon … don’t push me
right now.”
Resigned, I eased off the
gas and pulled to a stop on
the narrow shoulder.
“Better?”
She got out of the car and
went around the hood. I
stepped out, giving her a
questioning glance.
“I’m driving,” she
announced when she was
standing in front of me. “At
least until we get to the city.”
“If that’s what you want.”
I knew next to nothing
about relationships, but it was
a no-brainer to make
concessions when your
woman was mad at you.
Especially when you
entertained hopes of getting
laid in a few hours, which I
most definitely was. After
spending the weekend with
friends and Ireland, I was
feeling a renewed need to
show my wife just how much
I appreciated her.
“Don’t look at me like
that,” she muttered.
“Like what?” I raked her
with a glance, admiring how
pretty she looked in a strappy
white sundress. The evening
was hot and muggy, but she
looked airy and fresh. I
wanted to strip off my clothes
and press up against her, cool
off a little before heating
things up.
“Like I’m a ticking time
bomb ready to go off!” Her
arms crossed. “I am not being
irrational.”
“Angel, that’s not the look
I’m giving you.”
“And don’t try to distract
me with sex,” she bit out, her
jaw clenched. “Or you won’t
get any for a week!”
My arms crossed, too.
“We’ve already talked about
issuing ultimatums like that.
You can bitch at me all you
like, Eva, but I’ll have you
when I want you. Period.”
“Never mind whether I
want you?”
“Asks the wife who gets
wet watching me drive a
damn car,” I drawled.
Her gaze narrowed. “I may
just leave you here on the
side of the road.”
Clearly, I wasn’t
navigating the situation well.
So I switched tactics, taking
the offensive position.
“You don’t tell me
everything,” I countered.
“What about Kline? Has he
completely stopped
communicating with you
since San Diego?”
I’d been holding back the
question all weekend,
wondering how Kline was
going to handle Eva.
I was torn about how I
wanted him to proceed. If he
approached her about the tape
he no longer possessed, it
would hurt her but also drive
her closer to me. If he walked
away for her sake, it would
betray deeper feelings for her
than I was comfortable with. I
hated that he wanted her, but
I feared he might actually
love her.
She gasped. “Oh my God.
Have you been looking at my
phone again?”
“No.” My reply was swift
and decisive. “I know how
you feel about that.”
I followed her every move,
knew where she was and who
she was with at every
moment of the day, but she’d
set a hard limit with her cell
phone and I honored it, even
though it drove me crazy.
Eva studied me a minute
but must have seen the truth
on my face. “Yes, Brett has
sent me a few texts. I was
going to talk to you about it,
so don’t even try to say it’s
the same thing. I totally
intended to tell you. You had
absolutely no intention of
telling me.”
A car rushed by on the
road, turning my concern
toward her safety. “Get in and
drive. We’ll talk in the car.”
I waited until she climbed
into the seat, and then I shut
the door behind her. By the
time I settled in the passenger
side, she’d adjusted the
mirrors and seat to suit her
and put the car in gear.
The minute she was fully
merged in the lane, she
started in on me again. I was
vaguely aware of her
speaking, my attention more
focused on the way she
handled the Bentley. She
drove fast and with
confidence, her grip light and
easy on the wheel. She kept
her gaze on the road, but I
couldn’t take my eyes off her.
My California girl. On an
open road, she was fully in
her element.
I found myself pleasantly
aroused by watching Eva
handle the powerful SUV. Or
maybe it was that she was
chastising me, challenging
me.
“Are you listening to me?”
she demanded.
“Not really, angel. And
before you get more riled, it’s
entirely your fault. You’re
sitting there looking hot and
sexy, and I’m distracted.”
Her hand whipped out and
smacked my thigh.
“Seriously? Stop cracking
jokes!”
“I’m not kidding. Eva …
you want me to share, so you
can support me. I get it. I’m
working on it.”
“Not hard enough
apparently.”
“I’m not going to share
things that aggravate you
unnecessarily. There’s no
point.”
“We have to be straight
with each other, Gideon. Not
just occasionally, but all the
time.”
“Really? I don’t expect the
same from you. For example,
feel free to keep all the
unflattering comments your
father and Cary make about
me to yourself.”
Her lips pursed. She
chewed on that for a bit, then,
“Using that logic, wouldn’t it
be okay for me to not say
anything about Brett?”
“No. Kline impacts our
relationship. My mother does
not.”
She snorted.
“I’m right about this,” I
said evenly.
“Are you telling me that
your mom talking crap about
me doesn’t bother you?”
“I don’t like it. That said, it
doesn’t change how I feel
about you or her. And telling
you won’t change your
feelings about her, either.
Since the result is the same
either way, I choose the path
of least disruption.”
“You’re thinking like a
guy.”
“I should hope so.” I
reached over and brushed the
hair off her shoulder. “Don’t
let her cause trouble between
us, angel. She’s not worth it.”
Eva glanced at me.
“You’re pretending that what
your mom says and does has
no effect on you, but I know
that’s not true.”
I debated denying it, just to
shut down the topic, but my
wife saw everything I’d
rather hide. “I don’t let it
affect me.”
“But it does. It hurts and
you push it into that place
where you push everything
you don’t want to deal with.”
“Don’t analyze me,” I said
tightly.
Her hand touched my
thigh. “I love you. I want to
stop the pain.”
“You already have.” I
gripped her hand. “You’ve
given me everything she took
away. Don’t let her take any
more.”
With her eyes on the
winding road, Eva lifted our
joined hands and kissed my
wedding band. “Point taken.”
She gave me a quick smile
that told me she was done—
for now—and drove us home.

12
I DARED ANYONE to come up
with a more awe-inspiring
sight than Gideon Cross
taking a shower.
It amazed me that he could
be so matter-of-fact about
running his hands over all
that taut, tanned skin and
those perfectly defined slabs
of muscle. Through the
misted glass of my bathroom
shower, I watched the rivulets
of soapy water run down the
hard ridges of his abdomen
and the length of his strong
legs. His body was a work of
art, a machine he kept in
prime shape. I loved it. Loved
looking at it, touching it,
tasting it.
Reaching out, he swiped a
hand through the
condensation, revealing that
breathtaking face. One darkly
winged brow arched in silent
query.
“Just enjoying the show,” I
explained. The scent of his
soap teased senses that had
become trained to recognize
the fragrance as belonging to
my mate. The man who
stirred and pleasured my
body to delirium.
I licked my lips when he
casually stroked the heavy
length of his cock. He’d once
told me he used to masturbate
every time he took a shower,
a release he had considered as
routine as brushing his teeth.
I could see why, knowing
how powerful his sexual
appetite was. I would never
forget the way he’d looked
when he had jacked off in the
shower for me, so virile and
potent and hungry for
orgasm.
Since he’d met me, he
didn’t pleasure himself
anymore. Not because he
couldn’t still satisfy me if he
did, and not because I took
care of him enough to make
the effort redundant. For both
of us, being ready for sex
with each other was never a
problem, because the hunger
we felt was deeper than
physical.
Gideon teased me by
saying he saved himself to
satisfy my insatiability, but I
saw the self-restraint for what
it was—he gave me the right
to his pleasure. It was mine
and mine alone. He had none
without me, which was a
tremendous gift. Especially in
light of his past, when sexual
release had been used as a
weapon against him.
“It’s an interactive
exhibition,” he said, his eyes
warm with amusement. “Join
me.”
“You’re an animal.” My
thighs were wet with his
semen beneath my robe, since
I was the lucky girl who
woke up to his desire.
“Only for you.”
“Ooh, right answer.”
He smirked. His cock
lengthened. “You should
reward me.”
I moved away from the
threshold and stepped closer.
“How would you suggest I do
that?”
“Any way you like.”
That was a gift, too.
Gideon rarely relinquished
control, and then only to me.
“I don’t have enough time
to do you justice, ace. I’d hate
to cut things short when
they’re just getting
interesting.” I set my hand on
the glass. “How about we
revisit after my workout
tonight? You, me, and
whatever I want to do to
you?”
He shifted and faced me
head on, his hand lifting to
press against mine through
the glass. His gaze slid over
my face in a heated caress
that was damn near tangible.
His face was impassive, a
strikingly handsome mask
that revealed nothing. But his
eyes … those stunning blue
depths … they exposed
tenderness and love and
vulnerability.
“I’m all yours, angel,” he
said, his words so quiet I saw
them more than heard them.
I pressed a kiss to the cool
glass. “Yes,” I agreed. “You
are.”
NEW week. Same
ultrafocused Gideon. He
started working as soon as the
Bentley pulled away from the
curb, his fingers flying across
the keyboard built into a
dropdown tray table. I
watched him, finding his
intense concentration and
confidence extremely sexy. I
was married to a powerful,
driven man, and watching
him flex that ambition was a
major turn-on.
I was so into watching him
that I jumped when my
smartphone vibrated in my
purse against my hip.
“Jeez,” I muttered, digging
it out.
Brett’s name and photo
appeared on the lock screen.
Knowing I needed to deal
with him at some point if I
expected him to stop calling,
I answered.
“Hey,” I answered
cautiously.
“Eva.” The timbre of
Brett’s now-famous voice hit
me as forcefully as it always
had, but not in the same way.
I loved the way he sang, but
that love wasn’t intimate
anymore. It wasn’t personal. I
admired him the way I did a
dozen other singers. “Damn
it, I’ve been trying to reach
you for a week!”
“I know. I’m sorry, I’ve
been busy. How are you?”
“I’ve been better. I need to
see you.”
My brows rose. “When are
you coming to town?”
He laughed harshly, a
humorless sound that rubbed
me the wrong way.
“Incredible. Listen, I don’t
want to get into it on the
phone. Can we get together
today? We need to talk.”
“You’re in New York? I
thought you were on tour …
?”
Gideon’s rapid-fire typing
didn’t slow and he didn’t look
at me, but I could feel his
energy shift. He was paying
attention, and he knew who
was on the line.
“I’ll tell you what’s going
on when I see you,” Brett
said.
I frowned out the window
as we idled at a light, my
gaze on the flood of
pedestrians crossing the
street. New York was
teeming with life and frenetic
energy, gearing up to do
world-changing business.
“I’m on my way to work.
What’s going on, Brett?”
“I can meet you for lunch.
Or after you get off for the
day.”
I debated saying no, but the
determination in his tone
gave me pause. “Okay.”
Reaching over, I set my
hand on Gideon’s thigh. The
toned muscle was hard
beneath my palm, even
though he was at rest. The
tailored suits polished his
form into civility, but I knew
the truth about the vigorously
fit body that was only hinted
at underneath. “I can see you
at lunch, if we stick close to
the Crossfire Building.”
“All right. What time
should I be there?”
“A little before noon would
be best. I’ll meet you in the
lobby.”
We hung up and I dropped
the phone back into my purse.
Gideon’s hand captured mine.
I glanced at him, but he was
reading a lengthy e-mail, his
head bent slightly so that the
ends of his hair brushed his
sculpted jaw.
The warmth of his touch
soaked into me. I looked
down at the band he wore on
his finger, the one that told
the world he belonged to me.
Did his business associates
pay attention to his hands?
They weren’t those of a man
who pushed paper and tapped
on keyboards all day. They
were the hands of a fighter, a
warrior who practiced mixed
martial arts and pounded out
his aggression with both
boxing bags and sparring
partners.
Kicking off my shoes, I
curled my legs under me and
leaned into Gideon’s side,
setting my other hand on top
of his. I ran my splayed
fingers between his knuckles
and fingers, forward and
back, carefully resting my
head against his shoulder so
that I didn’t mess up his
pristine black jacket with my
makeup.
I breathed him in, feeling
the effect of him—his
nearness, his support—
permeate my being. The
smell of his soap was muted
now, the naturally seductive
scent of his skin altering the
fragrance into something
richer and more delicious.
When I was restless, he
settled me.
“There’s nothing for him,”
I whispered, needing him to
know that. “I’m too filled
with you.”
His chest expanded
abruptly, his sharp inhalation
audible. He pushed the tray
table up and away, then
patted his lap in invitation.
“Come here.”
I crawled into his lap,
sighing happily when he
shifted me into a spot that felt
made for me. Every peaceful
moment we had with each
other was treasured. Gideon
deserved the respite, and I
longed to be that for him.
His lips touched my
forehead. “You okay, angel
mine?”
“I’m in your arms. Life
doesn’t get better than this.”
I spotted three paparazzi
outside the Crossfire when
we arrived.
With a hand at the small of
my back, Gideon ushered me
through the entrance ahead of
him, escorting me quickly but
unhurriedly into the cool
lobby.
“Vultures,” I muttered.
“Can’t be helped that we’re
such a photogenic couple.”
“You’re such a humble
man, Gideon Cross.”
“You make me look good,
Mrs. Cross.”
We stepped into the
elevator with a few other
people and he took the rear
corner, hooking me to him
with an arm around my waist,
his hand pressed flat against
my belly, his chest warm and
hard against my back.
I savored those few
minutes with him, refusing to
think about work or Brett
until we parted on the
twentieth floor.
Megumi was already at her
desk when I approached the
glass security doors, and the
sight of her made me smile.
She’d trimmed her hair since
I’d seen her Friday night and
polished her nails a bright
red. It was good to see the
small signs that she was
reclaiming her spirit.
“Hey, you,” she greeted me
after buzzing me in, pushing
to her feet.
“You look great.”
Her smile widened.
“Thanks. How’d it go with
Gideon’s sister?”
“Awesome. She’s a lot of
fun. It makes me melt seeing
Gideon with her.”
“He makes me melt,
period. You lucky bitch.
Anyway, I put a call through
to your line earlier. They
wanted to leave a message.”
I shifted on my feet,
thinking of Brett. “Was it a
guy?”
“No, a woman.”
“Hmm, I’ll go check it out,
thanks.”
I headed back to my desk
and got settled in, my gaze
coming to rest on the collage
of photos of Gideon and me. I
still needed to talk to him
about Crossroads. There
hadn’t been a good time over
the weekend. We’d had
enough on our plates having
Ireland over.
He hadn’t slept Saturday
night. I’d hoped he would but
hadn’t really expected him to.
It was hard for me, thinking
of his inner struggle, his
worry and fear. He carried
shame, too, and an inherent
belief that he was broken.
Damaged goods.
He didn’t see in himself
what I saw—a generous soul
who wanted so much to
belong to something greater
than himself. He didn’t
recognize what a miracle he
was. When he didn’t know
what to do in a given
situation, he let instinct and
his heart take over. Despite
all he’d been through, he had
such an amazing capacity to
feel and to love.
He’d saved me, in so many
ways. I was going to do
whatever needed to be done
to save him, too.
I listened to my messages.
When Mark came in, I stood,
and met him with a grin and
bouncing anticipation.
His brows rose. “What’s
got you so excited?”
“A gal from LanCorp
called this morning. They
want to meet with us
sometime this week to talk a
bit more about what they’re
hoping to achieve with the
launch of the PhazeOne
system.”
His dark eyes took on a
familiar sparkle. He’d
become a happier man overall
since he and Steven had
become engaged, but there
was a whole different energy
to him when he was eager
about a new account. “You
and me, kid, we’re going
places.”
I hopped a little on my feet.
“Yeah. You’ve got this. Once
they meet with you in person,
you’ll have them eating out of
your hand.”
Mark laughed. “You’re
good for my confidence.”
I winked at him. “I’m good
for you, period.”
We spent the morning
working on the PhazeOne
RFP, putting together comps
to better grasp how we might
position the new gaming
system against its
competition. I had a
momentary pause when I
realized how much buzz
surrounded the upcoming
release of the next-generation
GenTen console—which
happened to be a product of
Cross Industries, making it
PhazeOne’s primary rival in
the marketplace.
Pointing the situation out
to Mark, I asked, “Is it going
to be a problem? I mean,
could LanCorp possibly see a
conflict of interest with me
working for you on this?”
He straightened in his
chair, leaning back. He’d
shucked his coat earlier but
remained smartly attired in a
white dress shirt, bright
yellow tie, and navy slacks.
“It shouldn’t be an issue, no.
If our proposed positioning
wins out over the other RFPs
they’re collecting, the fact
that you’re engaged to
Gideon Cross isn’t going to
make a damn bit of
difference. They’re going to
make their decision based on
our ability to deliver their
vision.”
I wanted to feel relieved,
but I didn’t. If we were
awarded the PhazeOne
campaign, I’d be helping one
of Gideon’s competitors steal
some of his market share.
That really bothered me.
Gideon worked so hard and
had overcome so much to lift
the Cross name up from
infamy to a level where it
inspired awe, respect, and a
healthy amount of fear. I
never wanted to set him back,
in anything.
I’d thought I would have a
little more time before I was
forced to make a choice. And
I couldn’t help feeling like
the choice to be made was
between my independence
and my love for my husband.
The dilemma niggled at me
all morning, chipping away at
the excitement I felt over the
RFP. Then the hours crept
toward noon and Brett took
over my thoughts.
It was time to take
responsibility for the mess I’d
made. I had opened the door
to Brett, and then I’d kept it
open because I couldn’t get
my head on straight. It was
my job now to fix the
problem before it impacted
my marriage any more than it
already had.
I headed down to the lobby
at five minutes to noon,
having asked permission from
Mark to leave a little early.
Brett was already waiting for
me, standing near the
entrance with his hands
shoved into his jeans pockets.
He wore a plain white T-shirt
and sandals, with sunglasses
propped atop his head.
My stride faltered a little.
Not just because he was hot,
which was undeniable, but
because he looked so out of
place in the Crossfire. When
he’d met me here before the
video launch in Times
Square, we had rendezvoused
outside. Now, he was in the
building, occupying a spot
too near to where I’d first run
into Gideon.
The differences between
the two men were stark and
didn’t have anything to do
with clothing or money.
Brett’s mouth curved when
he saw me, his body
straightening, shifting in that
way men moved when their
sexual interest was piqued.
Other men, but not Gideon.
When I’d first met my
husband, his body, his voice,
gave nothing away. Only his
eyes had betrayed his
attraction, and only for an
instant.
It was later I realized what
had happened in that moment.
Gideon had claimed me …
and given himself to me in
return. With a single look.
He’d recognized me the
moment he saw me. It took
me longer to understand what
we were to each other. What
we were meant to be.
I couldn’t help but contrast
the possessive, tender way
Gideon looked at me against
the earthier, lustful way Brett
raked me from head to toe.
It seemed so obvious
suddenly, that Brett had never
really thought of me as his.
Not the way Gideon did.
Brett had wanted me, still did,
but even when he’d had me,
he hadn’t asserted any
ownership and he certainly
hadn’t ever given anything
real of himself to me.
Gideon. My head tilted
back, my gaze searching for
and finding one of the many
black domes in the ceiling
that hid the security cameras.
My hand went to my heart,
pressing over it. I knew he
probably wasn’t looking. I
knew he’d have to
deliberately access the feed in
order to see me and that he
was far too busy with work to
think of it, but still …
“Eva.”
My hand dropped to my
side. I looked at Brett as he
approached me with the easy
prowl of a man who knew his
appeal and was confident of
his chances.
The lobby was swarming
with people flowing around
us in steady streams, as one
would expect in a midtown
skyscraper. When his arms
lifted as if to embrace me, I
stepped back and held out my
left hand instead, just as I had
done when we last met in San
Diego. I would never again
cause Gideon to feel the pain
I’d inflicted when he saw me
kissing Brett.
Brett’s brows lifted and the
heat in his eyes cooled.
“Really? Is this where we’re
at now?”
“I’m married,” I reminded
him. “Hugging each other
isn’t appropriate.”
“What about the women
he’s tapped all over the
tabloids? That’s okay?”
“Come on,” I chided. “You
know you can’t always
believe what the press feeds
you.”
His lips pursed. He shoved
his hands back in his pockets.
“You can believe what they
say about how I feel about
you.”
My stomach fluttered. “I
think you believe it.”
Which made me a little
sad. He didn’t know what
Gideon and I had, because
he’d never had it. I hoped he
would someday. Brett wasn’t
a bad guy. He just wasn’t
meant to be my guy.
Cursing under his breath,
Brett turned and gestured
toward the exit. “Let’s get out
of here.”
I was torn. I wanted
privacy, too, but I also
wanted to stay where there
were witnesses who could
reassure Gideon. In any case,
we couldn’t exactly have a
picnic in the Crossfire lobby.
Reluctantly, I fell into step
beside him. “I had some
sandwiches delivered a little
bit ago. Figured that would
give us more time to talk.”
Brett nodded grimly and
held out his hand for the bag I
was carrying.
I took him to Bryant Park,
weaving beside him through
the frenetic lunchtime crowds
on the sidewalks. Taxis and
private cars honked
insistently at the streams of
pedestrians too time-strapped
to obey the signals. Heat
shimmered off the asphalt,
the sun high enough in the
sky to spear down between
the towering skyscrapers. An
NYPD squad car hit its siren,
the piercing robotic chirps
and rumbles doing little to
expedite the cruiser’s
movement through the
clogged street.
It was Manhattan on an
average day and I loved it,
but I could tell Brett was
frustrated by the intricate
dance required to get through
the city. The shifting of
shoulders and hips to let
people pass, the quick inhales
to squeeze by too-big bags or
too-slow pedestrians, the
swift-footedness needed to
avoid the abrupt appearance
of new bodies filing out of
the many doorways that lined
the sidewalks. Life as usual in
NYC, but I remembered how
overwhelming it felt when
you weren’t used to so many
people occupying relatively
little space.
Entering the park just
behind the library, we found
an unoccupied bistro table
and chairs in the shade near
the carousel and settled in.
Brett pulled out the
sandwiches, chips, and
bottled water I’d ordered, but
neither of us started eating. I
scouted our surroundings
instead, aware that we could
be photographed.
I’d considered that when I
chose the location, but the
alternative was a noisy,
crowded restaurant. I was
hyperconscious of my body
language, trying to ensure
that nothing could be
misconstrued. The world at
large could think we were
friends. My husband would
know, in every way I could
show him, that Brett and I
had actually said good-bye.
“You got the wrong
impression in San Diego,”
Brett said abruptly, his eyes
shielded behind his shades.
“Brittany isn’t a serious
thing.”
“It’s none of my business,
Brett.”
“I miss you. Sometimes,
she reminds me of you.”
I winced, finding the
comment anything but
flattering. I lifted one hand
and gestured helplessly. “I
couldn’t go back to you,
Brett. Not after Gideon.”
“You say that now.”
“He makes me feel like he
can’t breathe without me. I
couldn’t settle for less.” I
didn’t need to say that Brett
had never made me feel like
that. He knew.
He stared at his steepled
fingertips, then straightened
abruptly and dug his wallet
out of his back pocket. He
pulled a folded photograph
out and set it on the table in
front of me.
“Look at that,” he said
tightly, “and tell me we didn’t
have something real.”
I picked up the photo and
spread it open, frowning at
the image. It was a candid
shot of Brett and me,
laughing together over
something lost to memory. I
recognized the interior of
Pete’s in the background.
There was a crowd of blurred
faces around us.
“Where did you get this?” I
asked. There’d been a time
when I would’ve given
anything to have an unposed
photo with Brett, believing
that such an insubstantial
thing would give me some
kind of proof that I was more
than a piece of ass.
“Sam took that after one of
our sets.”
I stiffened at the mention
of Sam Yimara, abruptly
reminded of the sex tape. I
looked at Brett, my hands
shaking so hard I had to put
the photo down. “Do you
know about … ?”
I couldn’t even finish the
sentence. Turned out, it
wasn’t necessary for me to.
Brett’s jaw tensed, his
forehead and upper lip
beaded with sweat from the
summer heat. He nodded.
“I’ve seen it.”
“Oh my God.” I recoiled
from the table, my mind filled
with all the possibilities of
what was captured on video. I
had been desperate to win
Brett’s attention, with a
complete lack of self-respect
that shamed me now.
“Eva.” He reached for me.
“It’s not what you think.
Whatever Cross told you
about the video, I promise it
isn’t bad. A little raw
sometimes, but that’s the way
it was between us.”
No … Raw was what I had
with Gideon. What I’d had
with Brett was something
much darker and unhealthy.
I clasped my trembling
hands together. “How many
people have seen it? Have
you shown it to— Has the
band watched it?”
He didn’t have to answer; I
saw it on his face.
“Jesus.” I felt sick. “What
do you want from me, Brett?”
“I want—” Shoving up his
sunglasses, he rubbed at his
eyes. “Hell. I want you. I
want us to be together. I don’t
think we’re over yet.”
“We never got started.”
“I know that’s my fault. I
want you to give me a chance
to fix it.”
I gaped. “I’m married!”
“He’s no good, Eva. You
don’t know him like you
think you do.”
My legs quivered with the
urge to get up and leave. “I
know he’d never show
footage of us to anyone! He
respects me too much.”
“The whole point was to
document the rise of the
band, Eva. We had to sort
through it all.”
“You could’ve watched it
alone first,” I said tightly,
horribly aware of the people
sitting not too far away. “You
could’ve cut us out before the
others saw it.”
“We’re not the only ones
Sam got on video. The other
guys had stuff, too.”
“Oh God.” I watched as he
shifted restlessly. Suspicion
bloomed. “And there were
other girls with you,” I
guessed, my nausea
worsening. “What did it
matter when I was just one of
many.”
“It mattered.” He leaned
forward. “It was different
with you, Eva. I was different
with you. I was just too
young and full of myself to
appreciate it at the time. You
need to see, Eva. Then you’ll
understand.”
I shook my head violently.
“I don’t want to see it. Ever.
Are you crazy?”
That was a lie. What was in
the video? How bad was it?
“Goddamn it.” He yanked
off his shades, throwing them
on the table. “I didn’t want to
talk about the fucking video.”
But there was a
defensiveness to his posture
that made me doubt him. His
shoulders were high and tight,
his mouth a hard line.
Whatever Cross told you …
He knew Gideon was
aware of the tape. He had to
know Gideon was fighting to
keep it buried. Sam would’ve
told him.
“What do you want?” I
asked again. “What was so
damned urgent you had to
come out to New York?”
I waited for him to answer,
my heart pounding. It was hot
as hell and humid, but my
skin felt chilled and clammy.
He couldn’t tell me he loved
me, not after I’d caught him
with Brittany. He couldn’t
warn me away from Gideon; I
was already married. Brett
was in Manhattan midtour,
something the band had to
agree with. And Vidal. Why
would they do that? What
would they get out of
interrupting their schedule?
When Brett just sat there,
his jaw working, I stood and
turned blindly away, hurrying
across the grass toward the
nearest gate in the wroughtiron
fence.
He called after me, but I
kept my head down, achingly
aware of the number of
people in the park whose
heads turned in my direction.
I was making a scene, but I
couldn’t stop. I left my bag
behind and didn’t care.
Get away. Get somewhere
safe. Get to Gideon.
“Angel.”
The sound of my
husband’s voice made me
stumble. I turned my head.
He rose from a chair near the
piano by Bryant Park Grill.
Cool and elegant, seemingly
impervious to the sultry heat.
“Gideon.”
The concern in his eyes,
the gentle way he enfolded
me in a hug, gave me
strength. He’d known this
meeting with Brett wouldn’t
go well. That I would be
upset and needy. That I
would need him.
And he was there. I didn’t
know how, and I didn’t care.
My fingers dug into his
back, practically clawing at
him.
“Shh.” His lips brushed
against my ear. “I’ve got
you.”
Raúl appeared beside us
with my bag in hand, his
stance conveying a
protectiveness that added to
the shield Gideon’s body
gave me. The riotous panic
inside me began to ease. I
wasn’t freefalling anymore.
Gideon was my net, always
prepared to catch me.
He led me down the steps
to where the Bentley waited,
with Angus standing ready to
open the back door. I slid
inside and Gideon joined me,
his arm wrapping around me
when I curled into him.
We were right back to
where we’d started that
morning. But in a matter of
hours, everything had
changed.
“I’ve got this,” he
murmured. “Trust me.”
I lifted my nose to his
throat. “They want to use the
footage, don’t they?”
“They won’t. No one will.”
There was a razor-sharp edge
to his words.
I believed him. And I loved
him more than I ever thought
possible.
WHAT an afternoon. I avoided
thinking about Brett by
working hard on game
console comps, including
GenTen; my mind was firmly
on Gideon when five o’clock
rolled around.
It wasn’t just PhazeOne
that worried me anymore. It
was also me, the girl I’d once
been. The sex tape could do
more damage to the Cross
name than anything a rival
company could do.
I texted Gideon. I hoped
for a quick answer but didn’t
expect one. Are you in your
office?
He replied almost instantly.
Yes.
Heading home, I typed back.
Want to say bye first.
Come up.
I released the breath I
hadn’t realized I’d been
holding. See you in ten.
Megumi was already gone
when I passed reception, so I
reached Gideon faster than
I’d planned on. His
receptionist was still at her
station, her long red hair
hanging sleekly around her
shoulders. She gave me a curt
nod and I gave her a smile,
unfazed.
Scott wasn’t at his desk
when I got back there, but
Gideon was standing at his,
his hands on the desktop as
he perused documents spread
out in front of him. Arash was
seated in one of the chairs, his
posture relaxed and easy as
he spoke. Neither of them
wore a coat, and both of them
looked mighty fine.
Arash glanced at me as I
came closer, and Gideon’s
head came up. My husband’s
eyes were so blue, the hue
struck me even across the
distance between us. His face
remained austerely
handsome, so classically
Gideon, and yet his gaze
softened at the sight of me.
My mouth curved when he
beckoned me with a crook of
his finger.
I entered his office and
held out my hand to Arash
when he stood. “Hey,” I
greeted him. “You keeping
him out of trouble?”
“When he lets me,” the
lawyer replied, catching my
hand and pulling me in for an
air kiss on my cheek.
“Back off,” Gideon said
dryly, his arm sliding around
my waist.
Arash laughed. “This new
jealous streak of yours is
vastly entertaining.”
“Your sense of humor is
not,” Gideon shot back.
I leaned into my husband,
loving the feel of his hard
body against mine. There was
no give to him, no yielding.
Except when he looked at me.
“I’ve got a meeting in
thirty,” Arash said, “so I’ll
head out. Thanks for Friday
night, Eva. I’d love to do it
again sometime.”
“We will,” I told him. “For
sure.”
As he left the office, I
turned to Gideon. “Can I hug
you?”
“You never have to ask.”
My heart felt squeezed by
the warm indulgence in his
eyes. “The glass is clear.”
“Let them see,” he
murmured, wrapping his arms
around me. He exhaled long
and slow when I clung to
him. “Talk to me, angel.”
“I don’t want to talk.”
Didn’t want to think about the
mess I’d made of my life,
which was now impacting the
man I loved. “I want to hear
your voice. Say anything, I
don’t care.”
“Kline won’t hurt you. I
promise you that.”
My eyes squeezed shut.
“Not about him. Tell me
about work.”
“Eva …”
I felt the tension in his
body, the strain of concern
and worry, so I explained. “I
just want to close my eyes for
a minute and feel you. Smell
you. Hear you. I need to just
soak you in for a minute, and
then I’ll be okay.”
His hands rubbed up and
down my back, his chin
resting on the top of my head.
“We’re going away. Soon.
For at least a week, although
I’d prefer two. I was thinking
we might go back to
Crosswinds. Spend the time
naked and lazy—”
“You’re never lazy.
Especially when you’re
naked.”
“Especially when you’re
naked,” he corrected,
nuzzling me. “But I’ve never
had you that way for an entire
week. You could wear me
out.”
“I doubt that’s possible,
fiend. But I’m willing to try
my best.”
“It won’t be our
honeymoon, per se. I want a
month for that.”
“A month!” I pulled back
and looked at him, my mood
lifting. “The entire economy
of New York could collapse
if you’re out of the game that
long.”
He cupped the side of my
face, his thumb brushing over
my brow. “I think my highly
capable team can manage a
few weeks without me.”
I caught his wrist and let a
little of my anxiety out. “I
couldn’t manage it. I need
you too much.”
“Eva.” He lowered his
head and pressed his lips to
mine, his tongue teasing them
open.
Gripping his nape in my
hand, I held him still while I
deepened the kiss. Fell into it.
He pulled me closer, lifting
me onto my tiptoes. His head
tilted, tightening the seal until
every breath was shared,
every moan and whimper.
I gasped when we broke
for air. “When will you be
home?”
“When you want me
there.”
“That would be when your
day is done. You’ve lost
enough time over me today.”
I smoothed his perfectly
placed tie. “You weren’t just
spying on me this afternoon.
You knew my lunch with
Brett was going to go south.”
“It was a possibility.”
“The spying? Or the
heading south?”
He shot me a look. “You’re
not going to give me a hard
time about being there for
you. You would’ve done the
same had the situation been
reversed.”
“How did you know what
he wanted?” Was the video’s
existence eating at him, too?
What I’d done and who I’d
been before?
“I know he’s getting
pressure from Christopher,
who’s also putting pressure
on the rest of the band.”
“Why? To get to you?”
“In part. You’re not just
some random hot blonde.
You’re Eva Tramell and
you’re news.”
“Maybe I should dye my
hair. Get rid of the ‘Golden.’
How about red?” I couldn’t
go brunette, not with
Gideon’s history of darkhaired
women. It would kill
me to look in the mirror every
day.
His face shuttered, closed
up like a steel trap even
though nothing else about
him gave away any tension. I
got a tingle at the back of my
neck, a prickling warning that
something had shifted.
“Don’t like the idea?” I
prodded, abruptly reminded
of a redhead from his past—
Dr. Anne Lucas.
“I like you just the way
you are. That said, if you
want a change, I won’t object.
It’s your body, your right. But
don’t do it just because of
them.”
“Would you still want
me?”
The tightness around his
mouth eased, the inflexibility
on his face fading away
nearly as swiftly as it had
appeared. “Would you still
want me if I had red hair?”
“Hmm.” I tapped my chin
with my finger, pretending to
contemplate the change.
“Maybe we should stick with
what we’ve got.”
Gideon kissed my
forehead. “That’s what I
signed up for.”
“You also signed up for
letting me have my way with
you tonight.”
“Name the time and place.”
“Eight o’clock? Your
apartment on the Upper West
Side?”
“Our apartment.” He
kissed me softly. “I’ll be
there.”

13
“BY THE WAY, congratulations
on your engagement.”
My gaze shifted from the
project engineer’s face on my
monitor to the photo of Eva
blowing kisses. “Thank you.”
I would much rather look
at my wife. For an instant, I
pictured Eva as she’d been
the night before, those plush
lips wrapped around my cock.
I had given her carte blanche
with my body and all she’d
wanted was to suck me off.
Again and again. And again.
Christ. I had been thinking
about the night we’d had all
day long.
“I’ll keep you posted on
the impact of the storm,” he
said, bringing my attention
back to work. “I appreciate
you calling personally to
check on us. The weather
conditions may set us back a
week or two, depending, but
we’ll open on time.”
“We have a cushion. Take
care of yourself and your
crew first.”
“Will do. Thanks.”
I closed the chat window
and checked my schedule,
needing to know exactly how
much time I had to prepare
for my next meeting with the
lead R and D team at PosIT.
Scott’s voice projected
from my phone’s speaker.
“Christopher Vidal Sr. is on
line one. It’s his third call
today. I’ve already told him
you’ll get back to him when
you can, but he’s insistent.
How do you want me to
handle?”
Calls from my stepfather
never boded well, which
meant delaying them ate into
the time I had to fix whatever
problem he needed to impose
on me. “I’ll take it.”
I hit the speaker button.
“Chris, what can I do for
you?”
“Gideon. Listen, I’m sorry
to disturb you, but you and I
need to talk. Would it be
possible for us to meet
today?”
Prodded by the urgency in
his voice, I picked up the
receiver and took him off
speaker. “My office or
yours?”
“No, your penthouse.”
I sat back, surprised. “I
won’t be home until close to
nine.”
“That’s fine.”
“Is everyone all right?”
“Yes, everyone’s fine.
Don’t worry about that.”
“It’s Vidal, then. We’ll
take care of it.”
“God.” He laughed
harshly. “You’re a good man,
Gideon. One of the best I
know. I should’ve told you
that more often.”
My gaze narrowed at the
edge in his tone. “I’ve got a
few minutes now. Just lay it
out.”
“No, not now. I’ll see you
at nine.”
He hung up. I sat for a long
minute with the receiver in
my hand. There was a knot in
my gut, one that was cold and
sharp.
I returned the receiver to its
cradle and my attention to
work, pulling up schematics
and reviewing the packet
Scott had placed on my desk
earlier. Still, my mind raced.
I couldn’t control what
happened with my family,
had never had any power
there. I could only clean up
the messes Christopher made
and try to keep Vidal from
going under. I drew the line,
however, at using the footage
of Eva. Nothing Chris could
say would change that.
Time was racing toward
the PosIT meeting when the
message app popped up on
my monitor and Eva’s avatar
appeared.
I can still taste you. Yummy. ☺
A dry laugh escaped me.
The knot I’d been ignoring
eased, then disappeared. She
was my clean slate. My fresh
start.
Soothed, I replied. The
pleasure was mine.
“I’VE got a lead.”
My head turned to find
Raúl entering my office.
He came to my desk with
brisk strides. “I’m still
running through the guest list
for that event you attended a
couple weeks ago. I’ve also
been running twice-daily
searches for photos. Got an
alert on this one today. I
secured a copy and made
some zoom views.”
I glanced at the photos he
slid across my desk. Picking
them up, I examined them
more closely, one by one.
There was a redhead in the
background. In each
successive picture, she was
brought closer to the fore.
“Emerald green dress, long
red hair. This is the woman
Eva saw.”
It was also Anne Lucas.
Something about the way she
was standing, with her face
averted, spurred a familiar
sickness in my gut.
I looked up at Raúl. “She
wasn’t on the guest list?”
“Not officially, but she was
on the red carpet, so I’m
thinking she had to have been
someone’s plus-one. I don’t
know who her escort was yet,
but I’m on it.”
Restless, I stood, shoving
my chair back. “She went
after Eva. You need to keep
her away from my wife.”
“Angus and I are
developing new protocols for
event security.”
Turning, I retrieved my
jacket from its hook. “You’ll
tell me if you need more
men.”
“I’ll let you know.” He
scooped up the photos and
started toward me. “She’s at
her office today,” he said,
accurately gauging my
intention. “Was still there
when I headed up to see you.”
“Good. Let’s go.”
“EXCUSE me.” The petite
brunette behind the desk
stood in a rush as I walked
by. “You can’t go in there.
Dr. Lucas is with a patient
now.”
I grabbed the knob and
opened the door, walking into
Anne’s office without
breaking stride.
Her head snapped up, her
green eyes widening the
instant before her red mouth
curved in a satisfied smile.
The woman on the couch
across from her blinked at me
in confusion, swallowing
whatever she’d been about to
say.
“I’m so sorry, Dr. Lucas,”
the brunette said breathlessly.
“I tried to stop him.”
Anne slithered to her feet,
her eyes on me. “An
impossible task, Michelle.
Don’t worry, you can go.”
The receptionist backed
out. Anne glanced at her
patient. “We’ll have to cut
today’s appointment short. I
apologize for this incredibly
rude interruption”—she
glared at me—“and of course
I won’t charge you. Please
talk to Michelle about
rescheduling.”
I waited in the open door
as the flustered woman
gathered her stuff, and then I
moved aside as she stepped
out.
“I could’ve called
security,” Anne said, leaning
back against the front of her
desk and crossing her arms.
“After going to all the
trouble of luring me here?
You wouldn’t.”
“I don’t know what you’re
talking about. Regardless, it’s
good to see you.” She
dropped her arms and gripped
the edge of her desk in a
deliberately provocative pose,
exposing her bare thigh as the
slit in her blue wrap dress slid
open.
“I can’t say the same.”
Her smile tightened.
“Break your toys, then throw
them away. Does Eva know
her days are numbered?”
“Do you?”
Unease dimmed her bright
eyes and shook her smile. “Is
that a threat, Gideon?”
“You’d like for it to be.” I
stepped closer, watched her
pupils dilate. She was
becoming aroused and that
revolted me as much as the
smell of her perfume. “Might
make your game more
interesting.”
She straightened and came
toward me, her hips swaying,
her red-soled black stilettos
sinking into the plush carpet.
“You like to play, too,
lover,” she purred. “Tell me,
have you tied up your pretty
fiancée? Flogged her into a
frenzy? Shoved one of your
extensive array of dildos into
her ass, so that it fucked her
while you pounded her pussy
for hours? Does she know
you, Gideon, the way I do?”
“Hundreds of women know
me the way you do, Anne. Do
you think you were special?
The only thing memorable
about you is your husband
and how it eats at him that
I’ve had you.”
Her hand swung up to slap
me and I didn’t stop her,
taking the hit unflinchingly.
I wish what I’d said were
true, but I had been
particularly depraved with
her, seeing ghosts of her
brother in the curve of her
smile, her mannerisms—
I caught her wrist when she
made a grab for my cock.
“Leave Eva alone. I won’t tell
you twice.”
“She’s the chink in your
armor, you heartless piece of
shit. You’ve got ice in your
veins, but she bleeds.”
“Is that a threat, Anne?” I
asked, calmly tossing her
words back to her.
“Absolutely.” She yanked
free of my grip. “It’s time to
pay, and your billions won’t
cover the debt.”
“Raising the stakes with a
declaration of war? Are you
that stupid? Or don’t you care
what this will cost you? Your
career … your marriage …
everything.”
I moved toward the door,
my stride leisurely even as
fury burned through me. I’d
brought this down on Eva. I
had to clean it up.
“Just watch me, Gideon,”
she called after me. “See what
happens.”
“Have it your way.” I
paused with my hand on the
doorknob. “You’ve started
this, but make no mistake, the
final move will be mine.”
“HAVE you had any
nightmares since we last saw
each other?” Dr. Petersen
asked, his demeanor laid back
and quietly interested, the
requisite tablet in his lap.
“No.”
“How often would you say
you have them?”
I sat as comfortably as the
easygoing doctor but was
irritably restless inside. I had
too much to deal with to
waste an hour of my time.
“Lately, once a week.
Sometimes a little longer in
between.”
“What do you mean by
lately?”
“Since I met Eva.”
He jotted something down
with his stylus. “You’re
facing unfamiliar pressures as
you work on your
relationship with Eva, but the
frequency of your nightmares
is lessening—at least for now.
Do you have any thoughts as
to why?”
“I thought you were
supposed to be explaining
that to me.”
Dr. Petersen smiled. “I
can’t wave a magic wand and
give you all the answers,
Gideon. I can only help you
sort through it.”
I was tempted to wait for
him to say more, make him
do most of the talking. But
the thought of Eva and her
hopes that therapy was going
to make some sort of
difference goaded me to
speak. I’d promised to try, so
I would. To a degree. “Things
are smoothing out for us.
We’re in sync more than
we’re not.”
“Do you feel that you’re
communicating better?”
“I think we’re better at
gauging the motives behind
each other’s actions. We
understand each other more.”
“Your relationship has
moved very quickly. You’re
not an impulsive man, but
many would say marrying a
woman you’ve known such a
short time—and one you
admit you’re still getting to
know—is extremely
impulsive.”
“Is there a question there?”
“An observation.” He
waited a moment, but when I
didn’t say anything, he went
on. “It can be difficult for
spouses of individuals with
Eva’s history. Her
commitment to therapy has
helped both of you; however,
it’s likely she’ll continue to
change in ways you may not
expect. It will be stressful for
you.”
“I’m no picnic myself,” I
said dryly.
“You’re a survivor of a
different sort. Have you ever
felt that your nightmares were
aggravated by stress?”
The question irritated me.
“What does it matter? They
happen.”
“You don’t feel there are
changes that can be made to
lessen their impact?”
“I just got married. That’s
a major life change, wouldn’t
you say, Doctor? I think
that’s enough for now.”
“Why must there be a
limit? You’re a young man,
Gideon. You have a variety
of options available to you.
Change doesn’t have to be
something avoided. What’s
the harm in trying something
new? If it doesn’t work out,
you always have the option to
go back to what you were
doing before.”
I found that wryly
amusing. “Sometimes, you
can’t go back.”
“Let’s try a simple change
now,” Dr. Petersen said,
setting his tablet aside. “Let’s
go for a walk.”
I found myself standing
when he did, not wanting to
be seated while he towered
above me. We stood face-toface
with the coffee table
between us. “Why?”
“Why not?” He gestured
toward the door. “My office
may not be the best place for
us to talk. You’re a man used
to being in charge. In here, I
am. So we’ll level the playing
field and hit the hallway for a
bit. It’s a public space, but
most of the individuals who
work in this building have
gone home.”
I exited his office before
him, watching as he locked
both his inner and outer office
doors before joining me.
“Ah, well. This is certainly
different,” he said, his mouth
curving wryly. “Knocks me
off my stride a bit.”
I shrugged and started
walking.
“What are your plans for
the rest of the evening?” he
asked, falling into step beside
me.
“An hour with my trainer.”
And then I said more. “My
stepfather is coming over
later.”
“To spend time with you
and Eva? Are you close to
him?”
“No, to both.” I stared
straight ahead. “Something’s
wrong. That’s the only reason
he ever calls me.”
I sensed his gaze on my
profile. “Do you wish that
were different?”
“No.”
“You don’t like him?”
“I don’t dislike him.” I was
going to leave it at that, but
again I thought of Eva. “We
just don’t know each other
very well.”
“You could change that.”
I huffed out a laugh.
“You’re really pushing that
angle tonight.”
“I told you, I don’t have an
angle.” He stopped, forcing
me to stop, too.
Tipping his chin up, he
eyed the ceiling, clearly
thinking. “When you’re
considering an acquisition or
exploring a new avenue of
doing business, you bring in
people to advise you, right?
Experts in their respective
fields?” He looked at me
again, smiling. “You could
think of me the same way, as
an expert consultant.”
“On what?”
“Your past.” He resumed
walking. “I help you with
that, you can figure out the
rest of your life yourself.”
“GET your head in the game,
Cross.”
My gaze narrowed. Across
the mat, James Cho hopped
on his bare feet, taunting me.
He grinned evilly, knowing
the unspoken challenge
would spur me on. Half a foot
shorter than me and lighter by
at least thirty pounds, the
former MMA champion was
lethally quick and had the belt
to prove it.
Rolling my shoulders back,
I adjusted my stance. My fists
came up, closing the opening
that had allowed his last
punch to connect with my
torso.
“Make it worth my while,
Cho,” I fired back, irritated
that he was right. My brain
was still back in Dr.
Petersen’s office. A switch
had been thrown tonight and I
couldn’t get a handle on what
it was or what it meant.
James and I circled,
feinting and striking out,
neither of us scoring a hit. As
always, it was just the two of
us in the dojo. The driving
beat of taiko drums rumbled
in the background from
speakers cleverly hidden in
the floor-to-ceiling bamboo
paneling.
“You’re still holding
back,” he said. “Falling in
love turn you into a pussy?”
“You wish. Only way
you’d beat me.”
James laughed, then came
at me with a roundhouse kick.
I dropped low and swept him,
taking him down. He
scissored his legs with
lightning speed, taking me
down with him.
We hopped back up.
Squared off again.
“You’re wasting my time,”
he snapped, his fist lashing
out.
I ducked to the side. My
left fist shot out, grazing his
side. His fist hit my ribs
straight on.
“No one piss you off
today?” He came at me in a
rush, giving me no option to
do anything but defend
myself.
I growled. Rage was
simmering in the back of my
mind, tucked away until I had
the time and attention to deal
with it.
“Yeah. I see that fire in
your eyes, Cross. Let it out,
man. Bring it on.”
She’s the chink in your
armor …
I lashed out with a
left/right combo, driving
James back a step.
“That all you got?” he
jeered.
I feigned a kick and then
threw out a punch, snapping
his head back.
“Fuck yeah,” he gasped,
flexing his arms, getting
pumped. “There you are.”
She bleeds …
Snarling, I lunged forward.
REFRESHED from a shower, I
had barely finished dressing
by pulling a T-shirt over my
head when my smartphone
started ringing. I picked it up
off the bed where I’d left it
and answered.
“A couple things,” Raúl
said after greeting me, the
background noise of a crowd
and music quickly fading,
then disappearing completely.
“I’ve noticed that Benjamin
Clancy is still keeping an eye
on Mrs. Cross. Not
constantly, but consistently.”
“Is that so,” I said quietly.
“Are you good with that?
Or should I talk to him?”
“I’ll deal with him.”
Clancy and I were due for a
chat. It had been on my list,
but I would move it up.
“Also—and you may know
this already—Mrs. Cross had
lunch with Ryan Landon and
some of his executives
today.”
I felt that terrible quiet
settle over me. Landon. Fuck.
He’d slid in somewhere I
hadn’t been watching.
“Thank you, Raúl. I’ll need
a private number for Eva’s
boss, Mark Garrity.”
“I’ll text it to you when I
have it.”
Ending the call, I shoved
the phone in my pocket,
barely resisting the urge to
throw it at the wall instead.
Arash had warned me
about Landon and I’d brushed
his concerns off. I’d been
focused on my life, my wife,
and while Landon had a wife
of his own, his primary focus
had always been me.
The ringing of the
penthouse phone jolted me. I
went to the receiver on the
nightstand and answered with
an impatient, “Cross.”
“Mr. Cross. It’s Edwin at
the front desk. Mr. Vidal is
here to see you.”
Jesus. My grip tightened on
the receiver. “Send him up.”
“Yes, sir. Will do.”
Grabbing my socks and
shoes, I carried them out to
the living room and pulled
them on. As soon as Chris
left, I was heading home to
Eva. I wanted to open a bottle
of wine, find one of the older
movies she knew by heart,
and just listen to her recite the
corny lines of dialogue. No
one could make me laugh like
she did.
I heard the elevator car
arrive and pushed to my feet,
running a hand through my
damp hair. I was tense and
despised the weakness.
“Gideon.” Chris paused on
the threshold of the foyer,
looking grim and worn,
which he so rarely did and
only then because of my
brother. “Is Eva here?”
“She’s at her place. I’m
heading over there when you
leave.”
He gave a jerky nod, his
jaw working but nothing
coming out of his mouth.
“Come in,” I said,
gesturing at the wingback
chair by the coffee table.
“Can I get you something to
drink?”
God knew I needed one
myself after the day I’d had
so far.
He stepped wearily into my
living room. “Anything
strong would be great.”
“Sounds good to me.” I
went to the kitchen and
poured us both a glass of
Armagnac. As I was setting
the decanter down, my phone
vibrated in my pocket.
Pulling it out, I saw a
message from Eva.
It was a selfie of her bare
leg glistening with water and
draped over the rim of her
bathtub with candles in the
background. Join me?
I swiftly revised my plans
for the evening. She’d been
sending me provocative texts
all day. I was more than
happy to both satisfy and
reward her.
I saved the photo and typed
back. Wish I could. Promise to
make you wet again when I get
there.
Tucking my phone away, I
turned and found Chris
joining me at the island. I slid
a tumbler over to him and
took a sip from mine.
“What’s going on, Chris?”
He sighed, both of his
hands wrapping around the
crystal. “We’re going to
reshoot the ‘Golden’ video.”
“Oh?” That was an
unnecessary expense,
something Chris wisely
avoided as a rule.
“I overheard Kline and
Christopher arguing in the
offices yesterday,” he said
gruffly, “and got the story.
Kline wants a redo and I
agreed.”
“Christopher doesn’t, I’m
sure.” I leaned back against
the counter, my jaw set.
Apparently, Brett Kline had
some serious feelings for Eva
after all. I wasn’t okay with
that. Not even close.
“Your brother will get over
it.”
I doubted that, but it would
do no good to say so.
But Chris read what I
didn’t say and gave a nod. “I
know the video has caused
stress for you and Eva. I
should’ve been paying more
attention.”
“I appreciate you being
flexible about it.”
He stared into his glass and
then took a long drink, nearly
downing the contents in a
single swallow. “I’ve left
your mother.”
I took a quick, deep breath,
grasping that the reason for
his visit had nothing to do
with work. “Ireland told me
you two had a fight.”
“Yeah. I hate that Ireland
had to hear it.” He looked at
me, and I saw the knowledge
in his eyes. The horror. “I
didn’t know, Gideon. I swear
to God, I didn’t know.”
My heart jerked in my
chest, then began to pound.
My mouth went dry.
“I, uh, went to see Terrence
Lucas.” Chris’s voice grew
hoarse. “Barged into his
office. He denied it, the lying
son of a bitch, but I could see
it on his face.”
The brandy sloshed in my
glass. I set it down carefully,
feeling the floor shift under
my feet. Eva had confronted
Lucas, but Chris … ?
“I decked him, knocked
him out cold, but God … I
wanted to take one of those
awards on his shelves and
bash his head in.”
“Stop.” The word broke
from my throat like slivers of
glass.
“And the asshole who did
… That asshole is dead. I
can’t get to him. Goddamn
it.” Chris dropped the tumbler
onto the granite with a thud,
but it was the sob that tore out
of him that nearly shattered
me. “Hell, Gideon. It was my
job to protect you. And I
failed.”
“Stop!” I pushed off the
counter, my hands clenching.
“Don’t fucking look at me
like that!”
He trembled visibly, but
didn’t back down. “I had to
tell you—”
His wrinkled dress shirt
was in my fists, his feet
dangling above the floor.
“Stop talking. Now!”
Tears slipped down his
face. “I love you like my
own. Always have.”
I shoved him away. Turned
my back to him when he
stumbled and hit the wall. I
left, crossing the living room
without seeing it.
“I’m not expecting your
forgiveness,” he called after
me, tears clogging his words.
“I don’t deserve it. But you
need to hear that I would’ve
ripped him apart with my
bare hands if I’d known.”
I rounded on him, feeling
the sickness clawing up from
my gut and burning my
throat. “What the fuck do you
want?”
Chris pulled his shoulders
back. He faced me with
reddened eyes and wet
cheeks, shaking but too stupid
to run. “I want you to know
that you’re not alone.”
Alone. Yes. Far away from
the pity and guilt and pain
staring out at me through his
tears. “Get out.”
Nodding, he headed toward
the foyer. I stood immobile,
my chest heaving, my eyes
burning. Words backed up in
my throat; violence pounded
in the painful clench of my
fists.
He stopped before he left
the room, facing me. “I’m
glad you told Eva.”
“Don’t talk about her.” I
couldn’t bear to even think of
her. Not now, when I was so
close to losing it.
He left.
The weight of the day
crashed onto my shoulders,
dropping me to my knees.
I broke.

14
I WAS DREAMING of a private
beach and naked Gideon
when I was jerked awake by
the sound of my phone
ringing. Rolling to my side, I
thrust my arm out and
smacked around on the top of
my nightstand, trying to find
my smartphone in the dark.
My fingers brushed against
the familiar shape and I
grabbed it, sitting up.
Ireland’s face lit up my
screen. I frowned and glanced
at the space beside me in the
bed. Gideon wasn’t home. Of
course, he could’ve found me
sleeping and gone next door
to go to bed …
“Hello?” I answered,
noting that the time on the
cable box said it was after
eleven o’clock.
“Eva. It’s Chris Vidal. I’m
sorry to call so late, but I’m
worried about Gideon. Is he
all right?”
My stomach dropped.
“What do you mean? What’s
wrong with Gideon?”
There was a pause. “You
haven’t talked to him
tonight?”
I slid out of bed and turned
on the lamp. “No. I fell
asleep. What’s going on?”
He cursed with an intensity
that made the hairs rise on my
arms. “I met with him earlier
about … the things you told
me. He didn’t take it well.”
“Oh my God.” I spun
around blindly. Something to
wear. I needed something to
put on over the racy teddy I’d
planned to seduce Gideon
with.
“You have to find him,
Eva,” he said urgently. “He
needs you now.”
“I’m going.” I tossed the
phone on my bed and yanked
a wool trench coat out of my
closet before racing out of my
room. I grabbed the keys to
the next-door apartment from
my purse and ran down the
hall. Fumbling with the
deadbolt, I took too long to
open the door.
The place was as shadowy
and silent as a tomb, the
rooms empty.
“Where are you?” I cried
into the darkness, feeling the
scratch of panicked tears in
my throat.
I ended up back in my
apartment, my fingers
trembling as I opened the app
on my smartphone that would
track his.
He didn’t take it well.
God. Of course, he didn’t.
He hadn’t taken it well when
I’d told Chris initially.
Gideon had been furious.
Aggressive. He’d had a
horrible nightmare.
The blinking red dot on the
map was right where I was
hoping it would be. “The
penthouse.”
I shoved my feet into flipflops
and hurried back out to
my purse.
“What the hell are you
wearing?” Cary asked from
the kitchen, jolting me.
“Jesus, you just scared the
shit out of me!”
He sauntered up to the
breakfast bar in just his Grey
Isles boxer briefs, his chest
and neck glistening with
sweat. Since the airconditioning
was working
fine and Trey was spending
the night, I knew exactly how
and why Cary was
overheated.
“It’s a good thing I did—
you can’t go out like that,” he
drawled.
“Watch me.” I slung my
bag over my shoulder and
headed toward the door.
“You’re a freak, baby girl,”
he shouted after me. “A
woman after my own heart!”
GIDEON’S doorman didn’t bat
an eye when I climbed out of
the back of the taxi in front of
his building. Of course, the
man had seen me in worse
shape before. So had the
concierge, who smiled and
greeted me by name as if I
didn’t look like a crazy
homeless person. Albeit one
in a Burberry coat.
I walked as fast as I could
in flip-flops to the private
penthouse elevator, waited
for it to descend to me, then
keyed in the code. It was a
straight shot up, but the ride
felt endless. I wished I could
pace the confines of the
small, elegantly appointed
car. My worried face stared
back at me from the spotless
mirrors.
Gideon hadn’t called.
Hadn’t sent me a text after
the flirtatious one promising
me a steamy night. Hadn’t
come to me, even if only to
sleep next door. Gideon
didn’t like being away from
me. Except when he was
hurting. And ashamed.
The elevator doors slid
open and pounding,
screaming heavy metal music
poured in. I cringed and
covered my ears, the volume
of the ceiling-mounted
speakers so loud it hurt to
hear them.
Pain. Fury. The raging
violence of the music crashed
over me. I ached deep in my
chest. I knew. I understood.
The song was an audible
manifestation of what Gideon
felt inside himself and
couldn’t let out.
He was too controlled.
Contained. His emotions so
tightly leashed, along with his
memories.
I dug into my purse for my
phone and ended up dropping
the whole bag, spilling the
contents onto the elevator car
floor and across the
checkerboard foyer. I left it
all where it fell except for my
smartphone, which I picked
up and swiped through to get
to the app that controlled the
surround sound. I synced it to
softer music, lowered the
volume, and hit enter.
The penthouse fell silent
for an endless moment, and
then the gentle chords of
“Collide” by Howie Day
began to play.
I felt Gideon approaching
before I saw him, the air
crackling with the violent
energy of an impending
summer storm. He rounded
the corner from the hallway
leading to the bedrooms. I
lost my breath.
He was shirtless and
barefooted, his hair a silky
tousled mane that brushed his
shoulders. Black sweats clung
to the lowest point of his hips,
underlining the tight lacing of
his abs. He was bruised on his
ribs and up by his shoulder,
the signs of battle only
strengthening the impression
of rage and ferocity tightly
leashed.
My choice of music
clashed with the emotion
seething from him. My
beautiful, savagely elegant
warrior. The love of my life.
So tormented that the sight of
him brought hot, stinging
tears to my eyes.
He jerked to a halt when he
saw me, his hands clenching
and releasing at his sides, his
eyes wild and nostrils flaring.
My phone slid out of my
hand and hit the floor.
“Gideon.”
He sucked in a breath at
the sound of my voice. It
changed him. I watched the
shift come over him, like a
door slamming shut. One
moment, he was bristling
with emotion. The next, he
was cool as ice, his surface as
smooth as glass.
“What are you doing
here?” he asked, his voice
dangerously even.
“Finding you.” Because he
was lost.
“I’m not fit company
now.”
“I can deal with it.”
He was too still, as if he
were afraid to move. “You
should go. It’s not safe for
you here.”
My pulse leaped.
Awareness sizzled across my
senses. I felt the heat of him
from across the room. His
need. The demand. I was
suddenly melting in my
jacket. “I’m safer with you
than anywhere else on earth.”
I took a deep breath for
courage. “Does Chris believe
you?”
His head went back. “How
do you know?”
“He called. He’s worried
about you. I’m worried about
you.”
“I’ll be fine,” he snapped.
Which told me he wasn’t fine
now.
I made my way to him,
feeling the burn of his gaze as
it tracked me. “Of course, you
will be. You’re married to
me.”
“You need to go, Eva.”
I shook my head. “It
almost hurts worse, doesn’t it,
when they believe you? You
wonder why you waited to
tell them. Maybe you
could’ve stopped it sooner, if
you’d just told the right
person?”
“Shut up.”
“There’s always that little
voice inside us that thinks
we’re to blame for what
happened.”
His eyes squeezed as
tightly closed as his fists.
“Don’t.”
I closed the distance
between us. “Don’t what?”
“Don’t be what I need. Not
now.”
“Why not?”
Those fiercely blue eyes
snapped open, pinning me so
thoroughly that I paused
midstep. “I’m hanging on by
a thread, Eva.”
“You don’t have to hang
on,” I told him, holding my
hands out to him. “Let go. I’ll
catch you.”
“No.” He shook his head.
“I can’t … I can’t be gentle.”
“You want to touch me.”
His jaw worked. “I want to
fuck you. Hard.”
I felt the heat sweep up to
my cheeks. It was a testament
to how much he wanted me
that he could still find me
desirable despite my
ridiculous clothes. “I’m
totally up for that. Always.”
My fingers went to the
lapels of my coat. I’d
partially buttoned up on the
cab ride over, not wanting to
flash anyone by accident.
Now the trench was
sweltering, my skin damp
with perspiration.
Gideon lunged and caught
my wrists, squeezing them
too hard. “Don’t.”
“You don’t think I can
handle you? After all we’ve
done together? All we’ve
talked about and plan on
doing?”
God. His entire body was
straining, tense, every muscle
thick and hard. And his eyes,
so bright against his tanned
skin, so agonized. My Dark
and Dangerous.
He gripped my elbow and
started walking.
“What—?” I stumbled.
He dragged me toward the
elevator. “You have to go.”
“No!” I struggled, kicking
off my flip-flops and digging
my feet in.
“Damn it.” He rounded on
me and yanked me up, facing
me nose to nose. “I can’t
promise to stop. If I take you
too far and you safe word, I
might not stop and this—us—
will all go to hell!”
“Gideon! For chrissakes,
don’t be afraid to want me
too much!”
“I want to punish you,” he
snarled, gripping my face in
both hands. “You did this!
You brought this on. Pushing
people … pushing me. Look
what you’ve done!”
I smelled the liquor on him
then, the rich vapor of some
expensive spirit. I’d never
seen him truly drunk—he
valued his control too much
to completely dull his senses
—but he was drunk now.
The first hint of wariness
rippled through me.
“Yes,” I said shakily, “this
is my fault. I love you too
much. Will you punish me for
that?”
“God.” He closed his eyes.
His hot, damp forehead
touched mine, nuzzling hard.
His sweat coated my skin,
imprinting me with the lushly
masculine scent that was his
alone.
I felt him soften, relaxing
infinitesimally. I turned my
head and pressed my lips to
his feverish cheek.
He stiffened. “No.”
Gideon pulled me toward
the elevator, yanking me into
the foyer and kicking the
scattered contents of my
purse out of the way.
“Stop it!” I yelled, trying to
tug my arm free.
But he wouldn’t listen. His
finger stabbed at the call
button. The car doors opened
instantly, the private elevator
always waiting to take him
down. He threw me in and I
stumbled into the rear wall.
Desperate, I yanked at the
belt of my coat, my urgency
giving me strength. I tore at
the buttons, sending them
rolling in every direction. The
doors were closing when I
spun to face him, holding the
lapels of my coat wide open
so he could see what I was
wearing beneath.
His arm shot out, blocking
the door from closing. He
shoved it open. The teddy I’d
worn was bloodred—our
color—and had scarcely any
material to it at all. Sheer
mesh exposed my breasts and
sex, while bandagelike
cutouts caged my waist.
“Bitch,” he hissed, stalking
into the confined space,
shrinking it too small. “You
can’t stop pushing.”
“I’m your bitch,” I shot
back, feeling the tears well
and fall. It was painful to
have him so angry with me,
even though I understood. He
needed an outlet and I’d
positioned myself as the
target. He’d warned me …
tried to protect me … “I can
take you, Gideon Cross. I can
take whatever you’ve got.”
He tackled me back into
the wall so hard the impact
knocked the breath from me.
His mouth covered mine, his
tongue plunging deep. His
hands squeezed my breasts
roughly, his knee pressing
hard between my legs.
I arched into him, fighting
to shrug off my coat. I was
too hot, sweat sliding down
my back and belly. Gideon
wrenched the trench off,
tossing it aside, his mouth
sealed to mine. A moan of
gratitude escaped me, my
arms wrapping around his
neck, my heart swelling with
the relief of holding him. My
fingers pushed into his hair,
my grip tightening to give me
leverage to crawl up him.
Gideon tore his mouth
away, then my hands. “Don’t
touch me.”
“Fuck you,” I snapped, too
hurt to hold the words back.
Just to spite him, I broke free
of his grip and let my hands
roam over his rock-hard
shoulders and biceps.
He pushed me back,
holding me to the wall with a
single hand against the
middle of my chest. No
matter how I shoved or
scratched at his steely arm, I
couldn’t budge him. I could
only watch as he yanked the
drawstring free of his sweats.
Desire and apprehension
twisted together inside me.
“Gideon … ?”
His gaze met mine, so dark
and haunted. “Can you keep
your hands off me?”
“No. I don’t want to.”
With a nod, he released
me, only to spin me around to
face the rear of the car. Caged
by his body, I had little room
to maneuver.
“Don’t fight me,” he
ordered, his lips to my ear.
Then he tied my wrists to
the handrail.
I froze, startled that he was
actually restraining me. So
surprised and disbelieving
that I barely struggled. It was
only after I watched him knot
the thin cord that I realized he
was serious.
Gripping my hips, he
nuzzled my hair aside and
sank his teeth into my
shoulder. “I say when.”
I gasped, tugging at my
hands. “What are you doing?”
He didn’t answer me.
He just left.
Twisting around as much
as I was able, I caught him
walking into the living room
just as the doors slid shut.
“Oh my God,” I breathed.
“You wouldn’t.”
I couldn’t believe he’d
send me away like this …
tied up in the elevator in only
lingerie. He was presently
screwed up in the head, yes,
but I couldn’t believe my
wildly jealous husband would
expose me that way, to
whoever might be in the
lobby, just to get rid of me.
“Gideon! Goddamn it.
Don’t you dare leave me in
here like this! Do you hear
me?! Get your ass back in
here!”
I wrenched at the cord
binding my wrists, but it was
knotted tight. Seconds passed,
then minutes. The car didn’t
move and after screaming
myself hoarse, I realized it
wouldn’t. It waited for the
push of a button, standing by
for Gideon’s command.
Just like I was.
I was going to kick his
fucking ass when I got loose.
I’d never been so pissed.
“Gideon!”
Bending over, I walked
backward, then lifted and
stretched one leg to reach the
button that opened the doors.
I pushed it with my big toe.
As they slid open, I sucked in
a deep breath to scream …
… then promptly lost it in
a startled rush.
Gideon strode through the
living room toward the foyer
… completely naked. And
drenched from head to toe.
His cock was so hard it
curved up to his navel. His
head was tipped back as he
guzzled bottled water, his
stride loose and easy, yet
entirely predatory.
I straightened as he drew
closer, panting from both the
riot of my emotions and the
depth of my hunger. Asshole
or not, I wanted him with a
ferocity I couldn’t fight. He
was complicated and sexy,
damaged and perfect.
“Here.” He brought a
crystal tumbler to my lips that
I hadn’t noticed because I’d
been too busy ogling his
magnificent body. The glass
was nearly full, the reddishgold
liquid sloshing against
my lips as he tipped it.
My mouth opened by
instinct and he poured the
liquor in, the potent proof
burning my tongue and
throat. I coughed and he
waited, his gaze heavylidded.
He smelled clean and
cool, refreshed from a
shower.
“Finish it.”
“It’s too strong!” I
protested.
He simply poured another
large swallow past my parted
lips.
I kicked at him, cursing
when I hurt my foot—and
didn’t do any damage to him
at all. “Stop it!”
He dropped the empty
water bottle and cupped my
face in his hand. His thumb
brushed away the drops of
liquor on my chin. “You need
to let me settle, and you need
to mellow out. We go at it
like this, we’ll tear each other
apart.”
A stupid tear slipped out of
the corner of my eye.
Gideon groaned and bent
toward me, his tongue licking
the trail of the droplet off my
cheek. “I’m shattered and
you’re beating at me with
your fists. I can’t take it,
Eva.”
“I can’t take you shutting
me out,” I whispered, tugging
at the damned cord. The
liquor was spreading fire
through my veins. I could feel
the tendrils of intoxication
curling around my senses
already.
He put his hand over mine,
stilling my restless
movements. “Stop that.
You’ll hurt yourself.”
“Cut me loose.”
“You touch me and I can’t
keep it together. I’m hanging
by a thread,” he said again,
sounding desperate. “I can’t
snap. Not with you.”
“With someone else?” My
voice became shrill. “You
need someone else?”
I couldn’t keep it together,
either. Gideon was the rock in
our relationship, the anchor. I
thought I could be the same
for him. I wanted to shelter
him, be his haven. But
Gideon didn’t need shelter
from the storm; he was the
storm. And I wasn’t strong
enough to bear up under the
weight of his crashing mood.
“No. Christ.” He kissed
me. Hard. “You need me in
control. I need to be in
control when I’m with you.”
I felt the panic building. He
knew. He knew I wasn’t
enough. “You were different
with the others. You didn’t
hold back—”
“Fuck!” Gideon spun
away, slamming his fist into
the control panel. The doors
opened to the sound of Sarah
McLachlan singing about
possession and he threw the
tumbler, shattering it against
the foyer wall. “Yes, I was
different! You made me
different.”
“And you hate me for
that.” I started crying, my
body sagging into the car
wall.
“No.” He wrapped himself
around me, his water-chilled
body curving over my back.
He rubbed his face against
me, his embrace so tight I
could barely breathe. “I love
you. You’re my wife. My
goddamn life. You’re
everything.”
“I just want to help you,” I
cried. “I want to be here for
you, but you won’t let me!”
“God. Eva.” His hands
began to move, to pet and
glide. To stroke. To soothe. “I
can’t stop you. I need you too
much.”
I gripped the handrail with
both hands, my cheek pressed
to the cool mirror. The liquor
began to work its magic. A
heated languor slid through
me, drowning my anger and
what fight I had left until they
drifted away, leaving me sad
and afraid and so desperately,
terrifyingly in love.
His hand pushed between
my legs, rubbing, searching.
With a forceful tug, he
opened the snaps that held the
front and back of the teddy
together. I moaned at the
sudden release of pressure.
My sex was wet and swollen
from the skilled movements
of his hands and the image in
my mind of the way he’d
looked walking toward me.
My head fell back against
his shoulder and I saw his
reflection. His eyes were
closed, his lips parted. The
vulnerability etched on his
gorgeous face undid me. He
was hurting so badly. I
couldn’t bear it.
“Tell me what I can do,” I
whispered. “Tell me how to
help.”
“Shh.” His tongue rimmed
the shell of my ear. “Let me
settle.”
The featherlight stroke of
his thumb over the mesh
covering my nipple was
driving me mad. The slide of
his fingers between the slick
folds of my cleft had me
quivering. He knew where to
touch me, how much
pressure.
I cried out when he pushed
two fingers inside me, my
feet flexing, lifting me onto
my toes. My knees weakened,
my legs quivering with the
strain. The air in the elevator
felt thick and steamy, heavy
with the need that pumped off
him in waves.
“Ah, Christ.” He groaned
when my sex tightened
around him, his hips rolling
against me to grind his
erection into my buttocks.
“I’m going to bruise this
sweet cunt, Eva. I can’t stop
it.”
His arm banded around my
waist and lifted me, pulling
me back so that my arms
were straight and I was bent
over. He kneed my legs apart,
his fingers sliding wetly from
my cleft. I felt his hand graze
my hip, and then he was
dragging the wide crest of his
penis through the seam of my
buttocks and notching it
between the lips of my sex.
I held my breath,
squirming against that plush
pressure. I’d wanted him all
day, craving the feel of his
big cock inside me, needing
him to make me come.
“Wait,” he groaned,
reaching for both my waist
and my shoulder, his fingers
flexing impatiently. “Let me
—”
My sex clenched,
tightening around the thick
head.
Gideon cursed and thrust,
one hard stroke that shoved
him deep. I cried out in
pleasured pain, arching away
from the rigid fullness,
feeling the burn of stretching
inner muscles and tender
tissues.
“Yes,” he hissed, yanking
me back into him until the
lips of my sex hugged the
thick root of his penis. His
hips circled, his balls lying
heavily against my engorged
clitoris. “Fucking tight …”
I moaned and tried to hold
on to the handrail; my body
rocked as he began to fuck.
The sensation was
devastating, being filled so
completely, then emptied
abruptly. My knees gave out,
my core spasming in delight
as he reamed me hard and
thoroughly. All the emotion
he’d pent up inside him was
hammered into me, the
relentless drives of his cock
massaging every sensitive
nerve.
I was coming before I
knew the orgasm was on me,
gasping his name as pleasure
racked my body in violent
trembles.
My head dropped between
my arms, my muscles weak
and useless. Gideon held me
up with his hands, with his
erection. Using my body.
Taking it. Grunting
primitively every time he hit
the end of me.
“So deep,” he growled. “So
good.”
In the periphery, I caught
movement, my dazed eyes
focusing on our reflection.
With a low, pained cry I
started coming again, if I’d
ever stopped. Gideon was the
most searingly erotic thing
I’d ever seen—his biceps
thick and hard as he
supported my weight, his
thighs straining with exertion,
his ass flexing as he pistoned,
his abs rippling with power as
he rolled his hips with every
stroke.
He’d been built to fuck, but
he had mastered the skill,
using every inch of his
amazing body to enslave a
woman to pleasure. It was
innate to him, instinctive.
Even drunk and near feral
with anguish, his rhythm was
tight and precise, his focus
absolute.
Every thrust took him deep
inside me, hitting the sweetest
spots again and again, driving
the ecstasy into me until I
couldn’t resist the onslaught.
Another climax churned
through me like a tidal wave.
“That’s it,” he groaned.
“Milk my dick, angel. God …
You’re making me come.”
I felt his cock thickening,
lengthening. Tingles raced
across my skin; my lungs
heaved for air.
Gideon threw back his
head and roared like an
animal, spurting hotly.
Gripping my hips, he pumped
me onto his ejaculating cock,
coming hard and forever,
filling me until semen slicked
my sex and inner thighs.
He slowed the thrust of his
hips, gasping, bending over to
press his cheek to my
shoulder.
I started sinking to my
knees. “Gideon …”
He pulled me up. “I’m not
done,” he said roughly, still
thick and stiff inside me.
Then he started again.
I woke to the feel of his hair
brushing over my shoulder
and the press of warm, firm
lips. Exhausted, I tried to roll
away, but an arm around my
waist pulled me back.
“Eva,” he rasped. His hand
cupped my breast, clever
fingers rolling my nipple.
It was dark and we were in
bed, although I barely
remembered him carrying me
there. He’d undressed me,
washed me with a damp
cloth, and rained kisses over
my face and wrists. They
were bandaged now, slicked
with ointment and wrapped
with care.
It had turned me on to feel
his tender caresses over the
chafing, the mix of pleasure
and pain. He’d noticed.
With eyes hot with lust,
he’d spread my legs and eaten
me with an insistent demand
that robbed me of the ability
to think or move. He’d licked
and sucked my cleft
endlessly, until I lost count of
how many times he made me
come around his wicked
tongue.
“Gideon …” Turning my
head, I looked at him over my
shoulder. He was propped on
one arm, his eyes glittering in
the faint light of the moon.
“Did you stay with me?”
Maybe it was reckless to
hope he’d stayed with me
while I slept, but sharing a
bed with him was something I
loved. And craved.
He nodded. “I couldn’t
leave you.”
“I’m glad.”
He rolled me over and into
him, taking my mouth,
kissing me softly. The
coaxing licks of his tongue
stirred me again, made me
moan.
“I can’t stop touching
you,” he breathed, gripping
my nape to hold me still as he
deepened the kiss, his teeth
tugging gently on my lower
lip. “When I touch you, I
don’t think about anything
else.”
Tenderness blended with
the love. “Can I touch you,
too?”
Closing his eyes, he
begged. “Please.”
I surged into him, my
hands sliding into his hair to
hold him as he held me. I
brushed my tongue against
his, our mouths hot and wet.
Our legs tangled, my body
arching to press against the
hardness of his.
He hummed softly and
slowed me down, rolling to
pin me to the bed. Pulling
back, he broke the seal of our
mouths, nibbling, sucking.
Tracing the curves of my lips
with the tip of his tongue.
I whimpered in protest,
wanting deeper, harder.
Instead, he licked leisurely,
stroking the roof of my
mouth, the lining of my
cheeks. I tightened my legs,
dragging him closer. He
rocked his hips, pressing his
erection into my thigh.
Gideon kissed me until my
lips were hot and puffy and
the sun was rising in the sky.
He kissed me until he came in
a hot rush against my skin.
Not once but twice.
The feel of him coming,
the sound of his low pained
moans of pleasure, knowing I
could bring him to orgasm
with just my kiss … I slicked
his thigh with my need and
ground against him until I
climaxed.
As the new day began, he
closed the distance he’d put
between us in the elevator.
He made love to me without
sex. He pledged his devotion
by making me the center of
his world. There was nothing
beyond the edges of our bed.
Only us and a love that
stripped us bare even as it
made us whole.
WHEN I woke again, I found
him sleeping beside me, his
lips as kiss-swollen as mine.
Gideon’s face was soft in
repose, but the faint frown
between his brows told me he
wasn’t resting as deeply as I
would wish. He lay on his
side, his body stretched long
and lean across the mattress,
the sheet tangled around his
legs.
It was late, nearly nine, but
I didn’t have the heart to
either wake him or leave him.
I hadn’t been at my job long
enough to miss a day, but I
decided to do it anyway.
I’d been putting my needs
first when it came to my
career, giving it the power to
someday put a wedge
between us. I knew my desire
to be independent wasn’t
wrong, but at that moment, it
didn’t feel right, either.
Pulling on a T-shirt and
boyshorts, I slipped out of the
bedroom and down the hall to
Gideon’s home office, where
his smartphone was bitching
that he was ignoring the
alarm to wake him up. I
turned it off and went to the
kitchen.
Mentally checking off the
things I needed to do, I called
and left a message for Mark
about missing work due to a
family emergency. Then I
called Scott’s desk and left a
message telling him that
Gideon wasn’t going to make
it in by nine and might not be
there at all. I told him to call
me and we could talk about it.
I hoped to keep Gideon
home all day, although I
doubted he would agree to
that. We needed time
together, alone. Time to heal.
I retrieved my smartphone
from the foyer and called
Angus. He answered on the
first ring.
“Hello, Mrs. Cross. Are
you and Mr. Cross ready to
go?”
“No, Angus, right now
we’re staying put. I’m not
sure we’ll be leaving the
penthouse today. I was
wondering, do you know
where Gideon gets those
bottles of hangover cure?”
“Yes, of course. Do you
need one?”
“Gideon might when he
wakes up. Just in case, I’d
like to have one waiting for
him.”
There was a pause. “If you
don’t mind me asking,” he
asked, his Scottish burr more
pronounced, “does this have
something to do with Mr.
Vidal’s visit last night?”
I rubbed at my forehead,
feeling the warning signs of
an impending headache. “It
has everything to do with it.”
“Does Chris believe?” he
asked quietly.
“Yes.”
He sighed. “Ach, that’s
why, then. The lad wouldna
been prepared for that. Denial
is what he knows and can
handle.”
“He took it hard.”
“Aye, I’m certain he did.
It’s good he has you, Eva.
You’re doing the right thing
for him, though it may take
him time to appreciate it. I’ll
get that bottle for you.”
“Thank you.”
With that accomplished, I
turned my attention to
cleaning the place up. I
washed the empty decanter
and tumbler I found on the
kitchen island first, then took
the broom and dustpan into
the foyer to clean up the
shattered glass. I talked to
Scott when he called while I
was picking up all the crap
that had fallen out of my
purse, and when we hung up,
I turned my attention to
scrubbing the foyer wall and
floor to remove the dried
traces of brandy.
Gideon had said he felt
shattered the night before. I
didn’t want him to wake up
and find his place that way.
Our place, I corrected
myself. Our home. I needed
to start thinking of it that
way. And so did Gideon. We
were going to have a
conversation about him trying
to kick me out. If I was going
to make a better effort at
entwining our lives, then he
had to as well.
I wished there were
someone I could talk to about
it all, a friend to listen and
give sage advice. Cary or
Shawna. Even Steven, who
had a way about him that
made him so easy to talk to.
We had Dr. Petersen, but that
wasn’t the same thing.
For now, Gideon and I had
secrets we could share only
with each other, and that kept
us isolated and codependent.
It wasn’t only innocence our
abusers had taken away from
us; they’d also taken our
freedom. Even after the abuse
was long over, we were still
caged by the false fronts we
lived behind. Still caged by
lies, but in a different way.
I had just finished
polishing all the smudges off
the mirror in the elevator
when it began descending
with me inside. In only a Tshirt
and underwear.
“Seriously?” I muttered,
yanking off my rubber gloves
to try to put order to my hair.
After rolling around with
Gideon all night, I looked like
an epic mess.
The doors slid open and
Angus started to step in, his
footstep halting midair when
he spotted me. I shifted
position, trying to hide the
cord still tied to the handrail
behind me. Gideon had cut
me loose with scissors,
freeing my wrists but leaving
the evidence.
“Uh, hi,” I said, squirming
with embarrassment. There
was no good way to explain
how I happened to be in the
elevator, scarcely dressed and
holding yellow rubber gloves,
when Angus had called it
down to pick him up. To
make things worse, my lips
were so red and swollen from
kissing Gideon for hours that
there was no way to hide
what I’d been up to all night.
Angus’s pale blue eyes lit
with amusement. “Good
morning, Mrs. Cross.”
“Good morning, Angus,” I
replied, with as much dignity
as I could manage.
He held out a bottle of the
hangover “cure,” which I was
pretty sure was just a shot of
alcohol mixed with liquid
vitamins. “Here you go.”
“Thank you.” The words
were heartfelt and carried
additional gratitude for his
lack of questions.
“Call me if you need
anything. I’ll be nearby.”
“You’re the best, Angus.” I
rode back up to the
penthouse. When the doors
opened, I heard the penthouse
phone ringing.
I made a run for it, sliding
into the kitchen on my bare
feet to snatch the receiver off
its base, hoping the noise
hadn’t woken Gideon.
“Hello?”
“Eva, it’s Arash. Is Cross
with you?”
“Yes. He’s still sleeping, I
think. I’ll check.” I headed
down the hall.
“He’s not sick, is he? He’s
never sick.”
“There’s a first time for
everything.” Peeking into the
bedroom, I found my husband
sprawled magnificently in
sleep, his arms wrapped
around my pillow with his
face buried in it. I tiptoed
over to put the hangover
bottle on his nightstand, and
then I tiptoed back out,
pulling the door closed
behind me.
“He’s still crashed,” I
whispered.
“Wow. Okay, change of
plan. There are some
documents you both have to
sign before four this
afternoon. I’ll have them
messengered over. Give me a
call when you’re done with
them, and I’ll send someone
to pick them up.”
“I have to sign something?
What is it?”
“He didn’t tell you?” He
laughed. “Well, I won’t ruin
the surprise. You’ll see when
you get them. Call me if you
have any questions.”
I growled softly. “Okay.
Thanks.”
We hung up and I stared
down the hall toward the
bedroom with narrowed eyes.
What was Gideon up to? It
drove me crazy that he set
things in motion and handled
issues without talking to me
about them.
My smartphone started
ringing in the kitchen. I ran
back across the living room
and took a look at the screen.
The number was an
unfamiliar one but clearly
based in New York.
“Good grief,” I muttered,
feeling like I’d already put in
a full day of work and it was
just past ten thirty in the
morning. How the hell did
Gideon manage being pulled
in so many directions at
once? “Hello?”
“Eva, it’s Chris again. I
hope you don’t mind that
Ireland gave me your
number.”
“No, it’s fine. I’m sorry I
didn’t call you back sooner. I
didn’t mean to make you
worry.”
“Is he okay, then?”
I went to one of the bar
stools and sat. “No. It was a
rough night.”
“I called his office. They
told me he was out this
morning.”
“We’re home. He’s still
sleeping.”
“It’s bad, then,” he said.
He knew my man. Gideon
was a creature of habit, his
life rigidly ordered and
compartmentalized. Any
deviation from his established
patterns was so rare it was
cause for concern.
“He’ll be all right,” I
assured him. “I’ll make sure
of it. He just needs some
time.”
“Is there anything I can
do?”
“If I think of anything, I’ll
let you know.”
“Thank you.” He sounded
tired and worried. “Thank
you for saying something to
me and being there for him. I
wish I had been when it was
happening. I’ll have to live
with the fact that I wasn’t.”
“We all have to live with it.
It’s not your fault, Chris.
Doesn’t make it easier, I
know, but you need to keep it
in mind or you’ll beat
yourself up. That won’t help
Gideon.”
“You’re wise beyond your
years, Eva. I’m so glad he has
you.”
“I got lucky with him,” I
said quietly. “Big-time.”
I ended the call and
couldn’t help but think of my
mother. Seeing what Gideon
was going through made me
appreciate her all the more.
She had been there for me;
she’d fought for me. She had
the guilt, too, which made her
overprotective to the point of
craziness, but there was a part
of me that hadn’t gotten quite
so damaged as Gideon
because of her love.
I called her and she
answered on the first ring.
“Eva. You’ve been
deliberately avoiding me.
How am I supposed to plan
your wedding without your
input? There are so many
decisions to make and if I
make the wrong one, you’ll
—” “Hi, Mom,” I interrupted.
“How are you?”
“Stressed,” she said, her
naturally breathy voice
conveying more than a little
accusation. “How could I be
anything else? I’m planning
one of the most important
days of your life all by myself
and—”
“I was thinking we could
get together on Saturday and
hash it all out, if that fits into
your schedule.”
“Really?” The hopeful
pleasure in her voice made
me feel guilty.
“Yes, really.” I had been
thinking of the second
wedding as being more for
my mother than anyone else,
but that was wrong. The
wedding was important to
Gideon and me, too, another
opportunity for us to affirm
our unbreakable bond. Not
for the world to see, but for
the two of us.
He had to stop pushing me
away to protect me, and I had
to stop worrying that I would
disappear when I became
Mrs. Gideon Cross.
“That would be wonderful,
Eva! We could have brunch
here with the wedding
planner. Spend the afternoon
going over all our options.”
“I want something small,
Mom. Intimate.” Before she
argued, I pressed forward
with Gideon’s solution. “We
can go as crazy as you want
with the reception, but I want
our wedding to be private.”
“Eva, people will be
insulted if they’re invited to
the reception and not the
ceremony!”
“I really don’t care. I’m not
getting married for them. I’m
getting married because I’m
in love with the man of my
dreams and we’re going to
spend the rest of our lives
together. I don’t want the
focus to ever shift from that.”
“Honey …” She sighed, as
if I were clueless. “We can
talk more about this on
Saturday.”
“Okay. But I’m not
changing my mind.” I felt a
tingle race down my back and
turned.
Gideon stood just beyond
the threshold to the kitchen,
watching me. He’d pulled on
the sweatpants from the night
before and his hair was still
mussed from sleep, his eyes
heavy-lidded.
“I’ve got to go,” I told my
mom. “I’ll see you this
weekend. Love you.”
“I love you, too, Eva.
That’s why I only want the
best for you.”
I killed the call and set my
phone down on the island.
Sliding off the seat, I faced
him. “Good morning.”
“You’re not at work,” he
said, his voice raspier, sexier,
than usual.
“Neither are you.”
“Are you going in late?”
“Nope. And you’re not,
either.” I went to him,
wrapping my arms around his
waist. He was still warm from
the bed. My sleepy, sensual
dream come true. “We’re
going to hole up today, ace.
Just you and me hanging out
in our pajamas and relaxing.”
His arm cinched around
my hips, his other hand lifting
to brush the hair back from
my face. “You’re not mad.”
“Why would I be?” Lifting
onto my tiptoes, I kissed his
jaw. “Are you mad at me?”
“No.” He cupped my nape,
pressing my cheek to his.
“I’m glad you’re here.”
“I’ll always be here. Until
death do us part.”
“You’re planning the
wedding.”
“You heard that, huh? If
you’ve got requests, tell me
now or forever hold your
peace.”
He was quiet for a long
time, long enough that I
figured he didn’t have
anything to add.
Turning my head, I caught
his lips and gave him a quick,
sweet kiss. “Did you see what
I left you by the bed?”
“Yes, thank you.” A ghost
of a smile touched his mouth.
He looked like a man
who’d been well fucked,
which filled me with
feminine pride. “I got you off
the hook at work, too, but
Arash said he had some
papers to send over to us. He
wouldn’t tell me what they
were.”
“Guess you’ll have to wait
and find out.”
I brushed my fingertips
over his brow. “How are you
doing?”
His shoulder lifted in a
shrug. “I don’t know. Right
now, I just feel like shit.”
“Let’s revisit that bath you
missed last night.”
“Umm, I’m feeling better
already.”
Linking our fingers
together, I started leading him
back toward the bedroom.
“I want to be the man of
your dreams, angel,” he said,
surprising me. “I want that
more than anything.”
I looked back at him.
“You’ve got that in the bag
already.”
I stared down at the contract
in front of me, my heart
racing with a dizzying
combination of love and
delight. I looked up from the
coffee table as Gideon
entered the room, his hair still
damp from our bath, his long
legs encased in black silk
pajama bottoms.
“You’re buying the Outer
Banks house?” I asked,
needing his confirmation
despite having the proof in
front of me.
His sexy mouth curved.
“We’re buying the house. We
agreed we would.”
“We talked about it.” The
agreed-upon price was a bit
staggering, telling me the
owners hadn’t been easy to
persuade. And he’d asked
them to convey the copy of
Naked in Death with the
property, along with the
furnishings in the master
bedroom. He always thought
of everything.
Gideon settled on the
couch beside me. “Now,
we’re doing something about
it.”
“The Hamptons would be
closer. Or Connecticut.”
“It’s a quick hop down by
jet.” He tipped my chin up
with his finger and pressed
his lips to mine. “Don’t worry
about the logistics,” he
murmured. “We were happy
there on the beach. I can still
picture you walking along the
shore. I remember kissing
you on the deck … spreading
you across that big white bed.
You looked like an angel and
that place, for me, was like
heaven.”
“Gideon.” I rested my
forehead against his. I loved
him so much. “Where do we
sign?”
He pulled back and slid the
contract over, finding the first
yellow sign here flag. His
gaze roved over the coffee
table and he frowned.
“Where’s my pen?”
I stood. “I’ve got one in my
purse.”
Catching my wrist in his
hand, he tugged me back
down. “No. I need my pen.
Where’s the envelope this
came in?”
I spotted it lying on the
floor between the couch and
table, where I’d dropped it
when I realized what Arash
had sent over. Picking it up, I
realized it was still weighted
and upended it over the table
to let the rest of the items
inside spill out. A fountain
pen clattered onto the glass
and a small photo floated out.
“There we go,” he said,
taking the pen and slashing
his signature on the dotted
line. As he went through the
rest of the pages, I picked up
the picture and felt my chest
tighten.
It was the photo of him and
his dad on the beach, the one
he’d told me about in North
Carolina. He was young,
maybe four or five, his small
face screwed up in
concentration as he helped his
dad build a sand castle.
Geoffrey Cross sat across
from his son, his dark hair
blowing in the ocean breeze,
his face movie-star
handsome. He wore only
swimming trunks, showing
off a body very much like the
one Gideon boasted today.
“Wow,” I breathed,
knowing I was going to make
copies of the image and frame
one for each of the places we
lived in. “I love this.”
“Here.” He pushed the
contract, with the pen lying
atop it, over to me.
I set the photo down and
picked up the pen, turning it
over to see the GC engraved
on the barrel. “You
superstitious or something?”
“It was my father’s.”
“Oh.” I looked at him.
“He signed everything with
it. He never went anywhere
without it tucked in his
pocket.” He raked his hair
back from his face. “He
destroyed our name with that
pen.”
I set my hand on his thigh.
“And you’re building it back
up with the same pen. I get
it.”
His fingertips touched my
cheek, his gaze soft and
shining. “I knew you would.”

“HIS-AND-HERS MASTER SUITE
—a classic.” Blaire Ash
smiled as his pen flew across
the large notepad clipped to a
board.
His gaze lifted to roam the
entirety of Eva’s bedroom in
the penthouse, the one I’d had
him design specifically to
look exactly like the room my
wife had in her Upper West
Side apartment.
“How big a change are you
looking for?” the designer
asked. “Do you want to start
with a blank slate, or are you
just looking for the easiest
structural change that will
combine the two rooms?”
I left it to Eva to answer. It
was difficult for me to
participate, knowing this
change was one neither of us
really wanted. Our home
would soon reflect how
fucked up I was and how
badly our marriage was
affected because of it. The
whole exercise was like a
knife in the gut.
She glanced at me, then
asked, “What would the easy
way look like?”
Ash smiled, revealing
slightly crooked teeth. He
was attractive—or so Ireland
assured me—and sported his
usual attire of ripped jeans
and a T-shirt under a tailored
blazer. I couldn’t care less
about his looks. What
mattered was his talent,
which I’d admired enough to
hire him to decorate both my
office and my home. What I
didn’t like was the way he
was looking at my wife.
“We could simply adjust
the layout of the master bath
and knock out an arched entry
through this wall, effectively
joining the two rooms via the
bathroom.”
“That’s just what we
need,” Eva said.
“Right. It’s quick and
efficient, and the actual
construction wouldn’t be all
that disruptive to your lives.
Or”—he went on—“I could
show you some alternatives.”
“Like what?”
He moved to her side, so
close that his shoulder
pressed against hers. Ash was
nearly as blond as Eva, the
image of them striking as he
bent his head to hers.
“If we work with the
square footage of all three
bedrooms and master
bathroom,” he replied,
speaking only to her as if I
weren’t there, “I could give
you a master suite that’s
balanced on both sides. Both
bedrooms would be the same
size, with his-and-hers
adjoining home offices—or
sitting room, if you prefer.”
“Oh.” She nipped absently
at her lower lip for a second.
“I can’t believe you sketched
that up so quickly.”
He winked at her. “Fast
and thorough is my motto.
And getting the job done so
well that you think of me
when you want to do it
again.”
I lounged against the wall,
my arms crossing as I
watched them. Eva seemed
oblivious to the designer’s
double entendre. I was
anything but.
The house phone rang and
her head came up. She looked
at me. “I bet Cary’s here.”
“Why don’t you get that,
angel?” I drawled. “Maybe
you should bring him up
yourself, share your
excitement.”
“Yes!” She ran her hand
over my arm as she hurried
from the room, a fleeting
touch that reverberated
through me.
I straightened, focusing on
Ash. “You’re flirting with my
wife.”
He stiffened abruptly, the
smile leaving his face. “I’m
sorry. I didn’t mean anything
by it. I just want Miss
Tramell to feel comfortable.”
“I’ll worry about her. You
worry about me.” I didn’t
doubt that he questioned the
arrangement we’d consulted
him to implement. Everyone
who saw it would. What redblooded
man in his right mind
would have a wife like Eva,
yet sleep not just in a
different bed but a different
room altogether?
The knife dug in a little
deeper and twisted.
His dark eyes went flat and
hard. “Of course, Mr. Cross.”
“Now, let’s see what
you’ve sketched so far.”
“WHAT do you think?” Eva
asked, between bites of
pepperoni and basil pizza.
She leaned over the island,
with one leg kicked up behind
her, having chosen to stand
on the opposite side from
where Cary and I sat.
I debated my reply.
“I mean the idea of a
master suite with two
mirroring sides is lovely,” she
went on, wiping at her mouth
with a paper napkin, “but if
we go the easy route, it’ll be
faster. Plus we could close up
the wall again one day, if we
want to use the room for
something else.”
“Like a nursery,” Cary
said, shaking crushed red
pepper onto his slice.
My appetite died and I
dropped the slice I’d been
eating onto my paper plate.
Lately, eating pizza at home
hadn’t been working out for
me.
“Or a guest room,” Eva
corrected. “I liked what you
talked to Blaire about for
your apartment.”
Cary shot her a look.
“Quick dodge.”
“Hey, you may have babies
on your mind, but the rest of
us have other things to check
off our lists first.”
She was saying exactly
what I wanted her to say, but
…
Did Eva have the same
fears I did? Maybe she’d
taken me as a husband
because she couldn’t help
herself, but drew the line at
taking me as a father to her
children.
I carried my plate to the
trash and tossed it in. “I have
some calls to make. Stay,” I
said to Cary. “Spend time
with Eva.”
He gave me a nod.
“Thanks.”
Leaving the kitchen, I
crossed the living room.
“So,” Cary began, before I
stepped out of earshot, “hotdesigner-
dude’s got a thing
for your man, baby girl.”
“He does not!” Eva
laughed. “You’re crazy.”
“No argument there, but
that Ash guy barely glanced
at you all night and kept his
eyes glued on Cross.”
I snorted. Ash had gotten
the message, which
reaffirmed my belief in his
intelligence. Cary was free to
read that however he liked.
“Well, if you’re right,” she
said, “I have to admire his
taste.”
I headed down the hallway
and entered my home office,
my gaze landing on the
collage of Eva’s photos on
the wall.
She was the one thing I
couldn’t tuck neatly away in
my mind. She was always at
the forefront, driving
everything I did.
Settling down at my desk, I
got to work, hoping to catch
up on what I could so that the
rest of the week wouldn’t be
thrown completely off. It took
me a bit to get my head in the
game, but once I did, I felt
relief. It was a reprieve to
focus on problems with
concrete solutions.
I was making headway
when I heard a yell from the
living room that sounded like
it had come from Eva. I
paused, listening. It was quiet
a moment, and then I heard it
again, followed by Cary’s
raised voice. I went to the
door and opened it.
“You could talk to me,
Cary!” my wife said angrily.
“You could tell me what’s
going on.”
“You know what the fuck
is going on,” he retorted, the
edge in his tone drawing me
out of my office.
“I didn’t know you were
cutting again!”
I moved down the hall. Eva
and Cary squared off in the
living room, the two friends
glaring at each other across
the span of several feet.
“It’s none of your
business,” he said, his
shoulders high and chin
canted defensively. He
glanced at me. “Not yours,
either.”
“I don’t disagree,” I
replied, although that wasn’t
quite true. How Cary selfdestructed
wasn’t my
concern; how it affected Eva
was.
“Bullshit. That’s total
fucking bullshit.” Eva’s gaze
shot to me as she turned to
bring me into their
conversation. Then she
looked back at Cary. “I
thought you were talking to
Dr. Travis.”
“When do I have time for
that?” he scoffed, raking his
hair back off his forehead.
“Between my work and Tat’s,
plus trying to keep Trey, I
don’t have time to sleep!”
Eva shook her head.
“That’s a cop-out.”
“Don’t lecture me, baby
girl,” he warned. “I don’t
need your shit right now.”
“Oh my God.” She tipped
her head back and looked at
the ceiling. “Why the fuck do
the men in my life insist on
shutting me out when they
need me most?”
“Can’t speak for Cross, but
you’re not around for me
anymore. I’m getting by the
best I can.”
Her head snapped down.
“That’s not fair! You have to
tell me when you need me.
I’m not a damn mind reader!”
Turning on my heel, I left
them to it. I had problems of
my own to work out. When
Eva was ready, she’d come to
me and I would listen, being
careful not to offer too much
of my opinion.
I knew she didn’t want to
hear that I thought she would
be better off without Cary.
THE early-morning light
slanted across the bed and
caught the ends of Eva’s hair
as she slept. The soft blond
strands glowed like burnished
gold, as if they were lit from
within. Her hand curled
gently on the pillow beside
her beautiful face, the other
tucked safely between her
breasts. The white sheet was
draped over her from hip to
thigh, her tanned legs
exposed by the tangle we’d
made before falling asleep.
I wasn’t a man given to
whimsy, but at that moment
my wife looked like the angel
I believed she was. I focused
the camera on the sight she
made, wanting to preserve
that image of her for all time.
The shutter snapped and
she stirred, her lips parting. I
took another shot, grateful I’d
bought a camera that just
might do justice to her.
Her eyelids fluttered open.
“What are you doing, ace?”
she asked, in a voice as
smoky as her irises.
I set the camera on the
dresser and joined her in the
bed. “Admiring you.”
Her lips curved. “How are
you feeling today?”
“Better.”
“Better is good.” Rolling,
she reached for her breath
mints. She turned back to me
smelling of cinnamon. Her
gaze slid over my face.
“You’re ready to tackle the
world today, aren’t you?”
“I’d much rather stay home
with you.”
Her eyes narrowed.
“You’re just saying that.
You’re itching to get back to
global domination.”
Bending down, I kissed the
tip of her nose. “You know
me so well.”
It still amazed me how well
she could read me. I was
feeling restless, a bit shaky.
Distracting myself with work
—seeing concrete progress
made on any of the projects I
was personally overseeing—
would ease that. Still, I
pointed out, “I could work the
morning at home, and then
spend the afternoon with
you.”
She shook her head. “If
you want to talk, I’ll stay
home. Otherwise, I’ve got a
job to get back to.”
“If you worked with me,
you could cybercommute,
too.”
“You’d rather push me on
that, huh? That’s the tack you
wanna take?”
I rolled onto my back and
slung my forearm over my
eyes. She hadn’t pushed me
the day before and I knew she
wouldn’t push me today. Or
tomorrow. Like Dr. Petersen,
she’d wait patiently for me to
open up. But knowing she
was waiting was pressure
enough.
“There’s nothing to say,” I
muttered. “It happened. Now
Chris knows. Talking about it
after the fact won’t change
anything.”
I felt her turn toward me.
“It’s not talking about the
events themselves that
matters, it’s how you feel
about them.”
“I don’t feel anything. It …
surprised me. I don’t like
surprises. Now, I’m over it.”
“Bullshit.” She slid out of
bed faster than I could catch
her. “If you’re just going to
lie, keep your mouth shut.”
Sitting up, I watched her
round the foot of the bed, the
tight set of her shoulders
doing nothing to detract from
how stunning she was. My
need for her was a constant
thrumming in my blood, so
easily provoked by her fiery
Latin temper into a restlessly
impatient craving.
I’d heard some say my
wife was as breathtaking as
her mother, but I disagreed.
Monica Stanton was a cool
beauty, one who gave off the
air of being slightly out of
reach. Eva was all heat and
sensuality—you could reach
her, but her passion would
scorch you.
I jumped out of bed and
waylaid her before she
reached the bathroom,
gripping her by the upper
arms. “I can’t fight with you
right now,” I told her
honestly, staring down into
the roiling depths of her
turbulent gaze. “If we’re out
of sync, I won’t make it
through the day.”
“Then don’t tell me you’re
over it when you’re
struggling to keep it
together!”
I growled, frustrated. “I
don’t know what to do with
this. I don’t see how Chris
knowing changes anything.”
Her chin tilted up. “He’s
worried about you. Are you
going to call him?”
My head turned away.
When I thought of seeing my
stepfather again, my stomach
churned. “I’ll talk to him at
some point. We do manage a
business together.”
“You’d rather avoid him.
Tell me why.”
I pushed back from her.
“We’re not suddenly going to
be the best of friends, Eva.
We rarely saw each other
before, and I see no reason
for that to change.”
“Are you angry with him?”
“Jesus. Why the fuck is it
my job to make him feel
better?” I headed for the
shower.
She followed. “Nothing is
going to make him feel better,
and I don’t think he expects
that of you. He just wants to
know that you’re back on
your stride.”
I reached into the stall and
turned the taps on.
Her hand touched my back.
“Gideon … you can’t just
shove your feelings into a
box. Not unless you want an
explosion like the other night.
Or another nightmare.”
It was the mention of my
recurrent nightmares that had
me rounding on her. “We
managed the last two nights
just fine!”
Eva didn’t back down in
the face of my fury the way
others did, which only
aggravated me further. And
seeing the myriad reflections
of her naked body in the
mirrors didn’t help.
“You didn’t sleep on
Tuesday night,” she
challenged. “And last night
you were so exhausted, I
doubt you even dreamed at
all.”
She didn’t know I’d slept
part of the night in the other
bedroom, and I didn’t see any
reason to mention it. “What
do you want me to say?”
“This isn’t about me! It
helps to talk things over,
Gideon. Laying it all out
helps us gain perspective.”
“Perspective? I’ve got that
just fine. There was no
mistaking the pity on Chris’s
face last night. Or yours! I
don’t need anyone feeling
sorry for me, damn it. I don’t
need their fucking guilt.”
Her brows shot up. “I can’t
speak for Chris, but that
wasn’t pity you saw on me,
Gideon. Sympathy, maybe,
because I know what you’re
feeling. And pain, certainly,
because my heart is
connected to yours. When
you’re hurting, I’m hurting,
too. You’ll have to learn to
deal with that, because I love
you and I’m not going to
stop.”
Her words ripped into me.
Reaching out, I gripped the
edge of the shower’s floating
glass.
Relenting, she came to me,
wrapped herself around me.
My head bowed as I soaked
her in. The smell of her, the
feel. My free arm slid around
her hips, my hand cupping
the full curve of her ass. I
wasn’t the same man I’d been
when we met. I was stronger
in some ways and weaker in
others. It was the weakness I
struggled with. I used to feel
nothing. And now—
“He doesn’t see you as
weak,” she murmured,
reading me the way she
always could. Her cheek lay
over my heart. “No one
could. After what you’ve
been through … to be the
man you are today. That’s
strength, baby. And I’m
impressed.”
My fingers flexed into her
supple flesh. “You’re biased,”
I muttered. “You’re in love
with me.”
“Of course I am. How
could I be anything else?
You’re amazing and perfect
—”I grunted.
“Perfect for me,” she
corrected. “And since you
belong to me, that’s a good
thing.”
I tugged her back and into
the shower, leading her under
the pounding jets of warm
water. “I feel like this
changed things,” I admitted,
“but I don’t know how.”
“We figure it out together.”
Her hands ran over my
shoulders and down my arms.
“Just don’t push me away.
You have to stop trying to
protect me, especially from
yourself!”
“I can’t hurt you, angel.
Can’t take any risks.”
“Whatever. I can take you
down, ace, if you get out of
hand.”
If that were true, it might
have been a comfort.
I switched gears, hoping to
avoid a fight that would send
ripples through the rest of my
day. “I’ve been thinking
about the penthouse
renovations.”
“You’re changing the
subject.”
“We exhausted the subject.
It’s not closed,” I qualified,
“just tabled until there are
additional variables to
address.”
She eyed me. “Why does it
turn me on when you go all
alpha mogul on me like that?”
“Don’t tell me there are
times when I don’t turn you
on.”
“God, I wish. I’d be a more
productive human being.”
I brushed the wet hair back
from her forehead. “Have you
thought about what you
want?”
“Whatever ends with your
cock inside me.”
“Good to know. I was
talking about the penthouse.”
She shrugged, her eyes lit
with mischievous amusement.
“Same goes either way.”
IT was the sort of local eatery
that tourists never spared a
glance. Small and lacking in
aesthetics, it boasted a vinyl
marquee that did nothing to
brand it as unique or
welcoming. It specialized in
soup, with sandwich options
for those with heartier
appetites. A cooler by the
door offered a limited
selection of beverages, while
an ancient register was only
capable of taking cash.
No, travelers would never
come to this place run by
immigrants who’d decided to
take a bite out of the Big
Apple. They’d head to the
spots made famous by movies
or television shows, or those
that dotted the garish
spectacle of Times Square.
The locals, however, knew
the gem in their
neighborhood and lined up
outside the door.
I slid through that line to
reach the back, where a tiny
room held a handful of
chipped enamel-topped
tables. A lone man sat at one
of them, reading the day’s
paper while steam curled out
of his cup of soup.
Pulling out the chair
opposite him, I sat.
Benjamin Clancy didn’t
look up when he spoke.
“What can I do for you, Mr.
Cross?”
“I believe I owe you
thanks.”
He folded the paper
leisurely and then set it aside,
his gaze meeting mine. The
man was solidly built, thick
with muscle. His hair was
dark blond, cut short in a
military style. “Do you?
Well, then, I accept. Although
I didn’t do it for you.”
“I didn’t think you did.” I
studied him. “You’re still
keeping watch.”
Clancy nodded. “She’s
been through enough. I’m
going to see she doesn’t go
through any more.”
“You don’t trust me to do
that?”
“I don’t know you enough
to trust you. In my opinion,
neither does she. So I’ll keep
an eye on things for a while.”
“I love her. I think I’ve
proven how far I’ll go to
protect her.”
His gaze hardened. “Some
men need to be put down like
rabid dogs. Some men need
to be the ones to do it. I didn’t
peg you as one of those guys
either way. That makes you
rogue in my book.”
“I take care of what’s
mine.”
“Oh, you took care of it all
right.” His smile didn’t quite
reach his eyes. “And I took
care of the rest. As long as
Eva is happy with you, we’ll
leave it at that. You decide
someday she’s not what you
want, you cut her off clean
and with respect. If you hurt
her in any way at all, then
you’ve got a problem,
whether I’m still breathing or
in the grave. You got me?”
“You don’t have to
threaten me to be good to her,
but I heard you.” Eva was a
strong woman. Strong enough
to survive her past and to
pledge her future to me. But
she was vulnerable, too, in
ways most people didn’t see.
That was why I would do
anything to shield her, and it
seemed Benjamin Clancy felt
the same.
I leaned forward. “Eva
doesn’t like being spied on. If
you become a problem for
her, we’ll sit down like this
again.”
“You planning on making
it a problem?”
“No. If she catches you at
it, it won’t be because I
tipped her off. Just keep in
mind that she’s spent her life
looking over her shoulder and
being suffocated by her
mother. She’s breathing easy
for the first time. I won’t let
you take that away from her.”
Clancy narrowed his eyes.
“I guess we understand each
other.”
I pushed back from the
table and stood, extending my
hand. “I’d say we do.”
AS my day ended and I
cleared off my desk, I felt
solid and settled.
There in my office, at the
helm of Cross Industries, I
had a handle on every detail. I
doubted nothing, least of all
myself.
The ground had leveled
beneath my feet. I’d
smoothed the feathers ruffled
by my Wednesday
cancellations, while staying
on track with my Thursday.
Despite missing a full day, I
was no longer behind.
Scott walked in. “I’ve
confirmed your agenda for
tomorrow. Mrs. Vidal will
meet you and Miss Tramell at
The Modern at noon.”
Shit. I’d forgotten about
lunch with my mother.
I glanced at him. “Thank
you, Scott. Have a good
night.”
“You, too, Mr. Cross. See
you tomorrow.”
Rolling my shoulders back,
I walked over to the window
and looked out at the city.
Things had been easier before
Eva. Simpler. During the day,
while consumed with work,
I’d taken a moment to miss
that simplicity.
Now, with the evening
upon me and time to think,
the prospect of major
alterations to the home I’d
come to see as a refuge
bothered me more than I
would admit to my wife. On
top of the other personal
pressures we faced, I felt
almost crushed by the scale of
the adjustments I was
making.
Waking up to Eva as she’d
been that morning was worth
it all, but that didn’t mean I
wasn’t struggling with the
aftermath of her entry into my
life.
“Mr. Cross.”
I turned at the sound of
Scott’s voice and found him
standing in the doorway to
my office. “You’re still here.”
He smiled. “I was on my
way out to the elevators when
Cheryl caught me at
reception. There’s a Deanna
Johnson in the lobby asking
for you. I wanted to confirm
that I should tell her you’re
no longer available today.”
I was tempted to turn her
away. I had little patience for
reporters and even less for
former lovers. “They can
send her up.”
“Do you need me to stay?”
“No, you can go. Thank
you.”
I watched him leave, then
watched Deanna arrive. She
strode toward my office on
long legs and high heels, her
thin gray skirt skimming the
tops of her knees. Long dark
hair swayed around her
shoulders, framing the zipper
that gave her otherwise
traditional blouse an edge.
She tossed me a megawatt
smile and held out her hand.
“Gideon. Thanks for seeing
me on such short notice.”
I shook her hand briefly
and briskly. “I expect you
wouldn’t go to the trouble of
coming here directly unless it
was important.”
The statement was both
fact and a warning. We had
come to an understanding, but
it wouldn’t last if she thought
she could exploit our
connection beyond what I’d
already conceded.
“Worth it for the view,”
she said, her eyes on me for
just a second too long before
shifting sideways to the
window.
“I’m sorry, but I’ve got an
appointment, so we’ll have to
make this quick.”
“I’m in a hurry, too.”
Tossing her hair over her
shoulder, she moved to the
nearest chair and sat, crossing
her legs in a way that showed
more of her toned thigh than I
wanted to see. She started
digging into her large bag.
I pulled my smartphone out
of my pocket, checked the
time, and called Angus.
“We’ll be ready in ten,” I told
him when he answered.
“I’ll bring the car around.”
Ending the call, I glanced
at Deanna, impatient for her
to get to the point.
“How’s Eva?” she asked.
“She’ll be here in a few
moments. You can ask her
yourself.”
“Oh.” She looked up at me,
one eye hidden behind the fall
of her hair. “I should
probably be gone before she
gets here. I think our …
history makes her
uncomfortable.”
“She knows how I was,” I
said evenly, “and she knows
I’m not that way now.”
Deanna nodded. “Of
course she does, and of
course you’re not, but no
woman likes when her man’s
past gets rubbed in her face.”
“Then you’ll have to make
sure you don’t do that.”
Another warning.
She withdrew a thin folder
from her bag. Standing, she
walked toward me. “I
wouldn’t. I accepted your
apology and appreciate it.”
“Good.”
“It’s Corinne Giroux you
might want to worry about.”
What patience I’d had
disappeared. “Corinne is her
husband’s concern, not
mine.”
Deanna held the folder out
to me. I took it and opened it,
finding a press release inside.
As I read, my grip
tightened until I crumpled the
edges.
“She’s sold a tell-all book
about your relationship,” she
said redundantly. “The
release officially hits the wire
Monday morning at nine.”

“OTHER COUPLES MEET, hit
things off, their friends
nitpick a little but are mostly
supportive, and they coast for
a while in that couple stage
just enjoying each other.” I
sighed and glanced at Gideon,
who sat beside me on the
couch. “We, on the other
hand, can’t seem to catch a
break.”
“What kind of breaks are
you referring to?” Dr.
Petersen asked, eyeing us
with fond interest.
That fondness gave me
hope. As soon as Gideon and
I had arrived, I’d noticed the
change in the dynamic
between him and Dr.
Petersen. There was
something looser between
them, a new ease. Less
wariness.
“The only people who
really want us to be together
are my mother—who thinks
us loving each other is a
bonus to his billions—and his
stepfather and sister.”
“I don’t think that’s a fair
assessment of your mother,”
Dr. Petersen said, sitting back
and holding my gaze. “She
wants you to be happy.”
“Yeah, well, a lot of being
happy for my mom is being
financially secure, which I
just don’t understand. It’s not
like she’s ever struggled for
money, so why is she so
afraid of not having any?
Anywayyyy …” I shrugged.
“I’m just irritated with
everyone right now. Gideon
and I get along great when
it’s just the two of us. I mean
we fight sometimes, but we
always get through it. And I
feel like we’re always
stronger once we do.”
“What do you fight
about?”
I glanced at Gideon again.
He sat beside me totally at
ease, looking gorgeous and
successful in his beautifully
tailored suit. It was on my todo
list to go with him the next
time he updated his wardrobe.
I wanted to watch them
measure that stunning body
of his, see them select the
materials and style.
I found him sexy as sin in
jeans and a T-shirt, and mindblowing
in a tuxedo. But I’d
always have a special
fondness for the three-piece
suits he favored. They
reminded me of how he’d
been when I first met him, so
beautiful and seemingly
unattainable, a man I’d
wanted so desperately that the
need overrode even my sense
of self-preservation.
I looked back at Dr.
Petersen. “We still argue
about the things he doesn’t
tell me. And we argue when
he tries to shut me out.”
He turned his gaze to
Gideon. “Do you feel the
need to maintain a certain
distance from Eva?”
My husband’s mouth
curved wryly. “There is no
distance between us, Doctor.
She wants me to dump
everything on her that’s an
irritant to me and I won’t do
that. Ever. It’s bad enough if
one of us has to bother with
it.”
I narrowed my eyes at him.
“I think that’s crap. Part of a
relationship is sharing the
load with someone else.
Maybe sometimes I can’t do
anything about the problem,
but I can be a sounding board.
I think you don’t tell me
things just because you’d
rather shove them into a
corner where you can ignore
them.”
“People process
information in different ways,
Eva.”
I wasn’t buying Gideon’s
dismissive reply. “You’re not
processing, you’re ignoring.
And I’m never going to be
okay with you pushing me
away when you’re hurting.”
“How does he push you
away?” Dr. Petersen asked.
I looked at him. “Gideon
… separates himself. He goes
somewhere else where he can
be alone. He won’t let me
help him.”
“ ‘Goes somewhere else’
how? Do you emotionally
withdraw, Gideon? Or
physically?”
“Both,” I said. “He shuts
down emotionally and goes
away physically.”
Gideon reached over and
took my hand in his. “I can’t
shut down with you. That’s
the problem.”
“That’s not a problem!”
I shook my head. “He
doesn’t need space,” I said to
Dr. Petersen, “he needs me,
but he cuts me off because
he’s afraid he’ll hurt me if he
doesn’t.”
“How would you hurt her,
Gideon?”
“It’s …” He exhaled
harshly. “Eva has triggers. I
keep them in mind, all the
time. I’m careful. But
sometimes, when I’m not
thinking clearly, it’s possible
I could cross the line.”
Dr. Petersen studied us.
“What lines are you worried
about crossing?”
Gideon’s grip tightened on
my hand, the only outward
sign he gave of any
uneasiness. “There are times
when I need her too much. I
can be rough … demanding.
Sometimes, I don’t have the
control I need.”
“You’re talking about your
sexual relationship?” He
returned Gideon’s nod.
“We’ve touched on that
briefly before. You said you
have sex multiple times a
day, every day. Is that still the
case?”
I felt my face heat.
Gideon’s thumb stroked
over the back of my hand.
“Yes.”
Dr. Petersen set his tablet
aside. “You’re right to be
concerned. Gideon, you may
be using sex to keep Eva at an
emotional distance. When
you’re making love, she’s not
talking, you’re not answering.
There’s a point when you’re
not even thinking, your body
is in charge and your brain is
just along for the endorphin
ride. Conversely, sexual
abuse survivors like Eva
often use sex as a way to
establish an emotional
connection. Can you see the
problem there? You may be
trying to achieve distance
through sex, while Eva is
trying to get closer.”
“I’ve already told you
there’s no distance.” Gideon
leaned forward, pulling my
hand into his lap. “Not with
Eva.”
“So tell me, when you’re
struggling emotionally and
you initiate sex with Eva,
what is it you’re looking
for?”
I twisted a little to look at
Gideon, totally invested in his
answer. I’d never questioned
why he needed to be inside
me, only how. For me, it was
as simple as him needing and
me giving.
His gaze met mine. The
shield over his eyes, that
mask of his, slipped away. I
saw the longing there, the
love.
“The connection,” he
answered. “There’s this
moment. She opens and I … I
open, and we’re there.
Together. I need that.”
“You need it rough?”
Gideon looked at him.
“Sometimes. There are times
when she holds back. But I
can get her there. She wants
me to get her there, needs it
like I do. I have to push.
Carefully. With control.
When I don’t have the
control, I need to back off.”
“How do you push?” Dr.
Petersen asked quietly.
“I have my ways.”
Dr. Petersen turned his
attention to me. “Has Gideon
ever gone too far?”
I shook my head.
“Do you ever worry that he
might?”
“No.”
His gaze was soft and
capped with a frown. “You
should, Eva. You both
should.”
I was stirring vegetables and
cubed chicken into a curry
mix on the stove when I
heard the front door opening.
Curious, I waited to see who
came into view, hoping Cary
had come home alone.
“Smells good,” he said,
walking up to the breakfast
bar to watch me. He looked
cool and casual in an
oversized white V-neck Tshirt
and khaki shorts.
Sunglasses hung off his collar
and wide brown leather cuffs
hugged each forearm, hiding
the threadlike cuts I’d spotted
the night before.
“Got enough for me?” he
asked.
“Just you?”
He smiled his cocky smile,
but I saw the tightness around
his mouth. “Yep.”
“Then I’ve got enough, if
you pour the wine.”
“You got yourself a deal.”
Joining me in the kitchen,
he looked over my shoulder
and into the pot. “White or
red?”
“It’s chicken.”
“White it is, then. Where’s
Cross?”
I watched him head to the
wine fridge. “With his trainer,
working out. How was your
day?”
He shrugged. “Same shit as
always.”
“Cary.” I lowered the heat
and turned to him. “Just a few
weeks ago, you were so
happy to be here in New
York and getting jobs. Now
… you’re so unhappy.”
Pulling a bottle out, he
shrugged again. “That’s what
I get for fucking around.”
“I’m sorry I haven’t been
here for you.”
He glanced at me as he dug
out the bottle opener. “But …
?”
I shook my head. “No buts.
I’m sorry. I will say that
you’ve had company most
nights I’m home, so I figured
that’s why we weren’t talking
as much, but that doesn’t
excuse me from not reaching
out when I know you’re
going through a difficult
time.”
Cary sighed, his head
bowing. “It wasn’t fair to
dump everything on you last
night. I know Cross has got
his own shit to wade through
and you’re dealing with that.”
“That doesn’t mean I’m
not here for you.” I put my
hand on his shoulder.
“Anytime you need me, just
let me know and I’ll be
there.”
Turning abruptly, he
caught me up in a powerful
hug, squeezing the air out of
me. Sympathy did the rest of
the work, squeezing my heart.
I hugged him in return, one
hand stroking the back of his
head. His dark brown hair
was as soft as silk, his
shoulders as hard as granite. I
guessed they’d have to be to
hold up the weight of the
stress he was carrying. Guilt
made me hold him even
tighter.
“God,” he muttered. “I’ve
fucked this all up to hell and
back.”
“What’s going on?”
He set me down, then
turned back to the bottle to
open it. “I don’t know if it’s
hormones or what, but Tat is
a raging fucking bitch right
now. Nothing is good
enough. Nothing makes her
happy, especially being
pregnant. What shot has the
poor kid got with me as a
father and a self-centered diva
who hates him as his
mother?”
“Maybe it’s a girl,” I said,
handing over the wineglasses
I’d pulled out of the
cupboard.
“Jesus. Don’t say that. I’m
panicked enough as it is.” He
poured two hefty glasses, slid
one over to me, and drank
deep from his own. “And I
feel like an asshole talking
about the mother of my baby
that way, but it’s the truth.
God help us, it’s the damned
truth.”
“I’m sure it’s just the
hormones. It’ll all settle in,
and then she’ll get that glow
and be happy.” I took a sip,
hoping like hell everything I
was saying would come true.
“Have you told Trey yet?”
Cary shook his head. “He’s
the one sane thing I’ve got
going on right now. I lose
him, I’ll lose my mind.”
“He’s stayed with you so
far.”
“And I have to work for it,
Eva. Every day. I’ve never
worked so hard. And I’m not
talking about fucking.”
“I didn’t think you were.” I
pulled two clean bowls out of
the dishwasher, along with
spoons. “What I think is that
you’re an amazing guy and
anyone would be lucky to
have you. I’m pretty sure
Trey feels the same way.”
“Don’t. Please.” His gaze
met mine. “I’m trying to be
real here. I don’t need you to
blow smoke at me.”
“I’m not. Maybe what I
said wasn’t deep, but it’s
true.” I paused in front of the
rice cooker. “Gideon doesn’t
tell me what’s going on with
him a lot of the time. He says
he’s trying to protect me, but
what he’s really doing is
protecting himself.”
And it took saying the
words aloud to really make
them sink in for me.
“He’s afraid that the more
he tells me, the more reason
he gives me to walk away.
But it’s just the opposite,
Cary. The more he doesn’t
say, the more I don’t feel like
he trusts me, and that’s
hurting us. You and Trey
have been together as long as
Gideon and I have.” I reached
out and touched his arm.
“You have to tell him. If he
finds out about the baby some
other way—and he will—he
might not forgive you.”
Cary sagged against the
island, suddenly looking so
much older and so tired. “I
feel like if I just had more
time to get a handle on things,
I could deal with Trey.”
“Waiting isn’t helping,” I
said gently, scooping rice into
the bowls. “You’re
backsliding.”
“What else have I got?”
His voice came hard with
anger. “I don’t fuck around
anymore. A monk gets off
more than I do.”
I winced, knowing Cary
was a man who exemplified
what Dr. Petersen had talked
about. When Cary had sex, he
could turn his brain off and
let his body make him feel
good, if only for a little while.
He didn’t have to think or
feel beyond the sensory. It
was a coping mechanism he’d
had to perfect back when he
was the one being fucked,
long before he was old
enough to even want to.
“You’ve got me,” I
countered.
“Baby girl, I love you, but
you’re not always what I need
to get by.”
“Cutting yourself and
banging everyone who’ll let
you isn’t getting you by,
either. They certainly don’t
help you feel good about
yourself.”
“Something has to.”
I poured curry over the rice
and passed the bowl over
along with a spoon. “Taking
care of yourself will do it.
Trusting the people you love
will help, too. Being honest
with yourself and with them.
Sounds simple, but we both
know it’s not. Still, it’s the
only way, Cary.”
He flashed me a quick, sad
smile and took the food I
handed him. “I’m scared.”
“There,” I said softly,
returning his smile. “That was
honest. Would it help if I’m
with you when you talk to
Trey?”
“Yeah. I’ll feel like a pussy
for not doing it alone, but
yeah, it’d help.”
“Then I’ll be there.”
Cary caught me in a hug
from behind, his cheek
resting against my shoulder.
“You really are always there
for me. I love you for that.”
Reaching back, I ran my
fingers through his hair. “I
love you, too.”
THE comforter lifted away
from my skin, waking me,
and then the mattress shifted
under the weight of the man
sliding into my bed.
“Gideon.”
Eyes closed, I turned to
him. Breathing deep, I
inhaled the scent of his skin.
My hands found the cool
strength of his body, slid over
him, pulled him close to
warm him.
He took my mouth in a
deep, urgent kiss. The shock
of his hunger woke me the
rest of the way; the greed in
his touch sent my heart
racing. He slid over me, then
down, his mouth searing my
nipples, then my belly, then
my sex.
I gasped and arched. He
tongued my clit with
demanding focus, driving me
higher, his hands pinning my
hips as I writhed under the
lash of his tongue.
I came hard, crying out. He
wiped his lips on my inner
thigh and rose, a seductive
looming shadow in the dark
of night. He mounted me,
thrust hard inside me.
Over my moan, I heard
him growl my name as if the
pleasure of taking me were
too great to bear. I gripped his
waist; he gripped the sheets.
His hips surged and rolled,
stroking that magnificent
penis deep and tirelessly
inside me.
When I woke again the sun
was up, and the place beside
me in the bed was cold and
empty.

I WAS FIXING a cup of coffee
for Eva the next morning
when my smartphone started
ringing. Leaving the half-andhalf
on the counter, I crossed
to the bar stool where I’d
hung my coat and pulled my
phone out of the pocket.
Steeling myself, I
answered, “Good morning,
Mother.”
“Gideon. I’m sorry to
cancel on such short
notice”—she took a shaky
breath—“but I won’t be able
to make lunch this
afternoon.”
I returned to my coffee,
knowing I’d need it for the
long day ahead. “That’s fine.”
“I’m sure you’re relieved,”
she said bitterly.
I took a drink, wishing it
were something stronger
though it was barely past
eight. “Don’t. If I didn’t want
to have lunch with you, I
would’ve canceled.”
She was quiet a minute,
then asked, “Have you seen
Chris lately?”
I took another sip, my gaze
on the hallway as I waited for
Eva. “I saw him Tuesday.”
“That long ago?” There
was a note of fear in her
voice. It gave me no pleasure
to hear it.
Eva rushed into the living
room in bare feet, her body
encased in a pale beige sheath
dress that managed to be
professional while still
hugging all her curves. I’d
picked it out for her knowing
the color would showcase the
color of her skin and the
paleness of her hair.
Pleasure at the sight of her
slid through my veins like the
liquor I’d wished were in my
coffee. She could do that to
me, intoxicate and captivate
me.
“I have to go,” I said. “I’ll
call you later.”
“You never do.”
I set my mug down to pick
up Eva’s. “I wouldn’t say it if
I didn’t mean it.”
Ending the call, I shoved
the phone in my pocket and
handed the coffee to my wife.
“You look stunning,” I
murmured, bending to press a
kiss to her cheek.
“For a man who claims not
to know a damn thing about
women, you sure know how
to dress one,” she said, eyeing
me over the lip of her mug as
she took a sip.
A low moan of pleasure
escaped her as she
swallowed, a sound very
similar to the one she made
when I slid my cock inside
her. Coffee, I’d learned, was
one of Eva’s addictions.
“I’ve made mistakes, but
I’m learning.” I leaned back
against the counter and pulled
her between my spread legs.
Had she noticed one less Vera
Wang dress in the closet? I’d
removed it from her wardrobe
after realizing just how much
of her luscious tits it exposed.
She held the mug up.
“Thank you for this.”
“My pleasure.” I brushed
my fingertips across her
cheek. “I have to talk to you
about something.”
“Oh? What’s up, ace?”
“Do you still have a
Google alert on me?”
She looked into her mug.
“Is this when I should plead
the Fifth?”
“That won’t be necessary.”
I waited until she looked up
at me again. “Corinne has
sold a book about our time
together.”
“What?” Her eyes
darkened from pale gray to
slate.
I cupped her nape and
stroked over her racing pulse
with my thumb. “From what I
read in the press release, she
kept a diary during that time.
She’s also sharing personal
photos.”
“Why? Why would she sell
that stuff for people to paw
through?”
The hand holding her mug
trembled, so I took it from her
and set it back on the counter.
“I don’t think she knows
why.”
“Can you stop it?”
“No. However, if she lies
outright and I can prove it, I
can go after her for that.”
“But only after it’s
released.” Her hands came to
rest on my chest. “She knows
you’ll have to read it. You’ll
have to see all the photos and
read about how much she
loves you. You’ll read about
things you did that you don’t
even remember now.”
“And it won’t matter.” I
pressed my lips to her
forehead. “I never loved her,
not the way I do you.
Looking back on that time
isn’t going to make me
suddenly wish I were with her
and not you.”
“She didn’t push you,” she
whispered. “Not like I do.”
I spoke against her skin,
wishing I could press the
words into her mind in a way
that she would never doubt
them. “She also didn’t make
me burn. Didn’t make me
hunger, and hope, and dream
like you do. There’s no
comparison, angel, and no
going back. I would never
want to.”
Her beautiful eyes closed.
She leaned into me. “The hits
just keep on coming, don’t
they?”
I looked over her head and
out the window beyond, at
the world that waited for us
once we stepped outside. “Let
’em come.”
She exhaled roughly.
“Yeah, let ’em come.”
I entered Tableau One and
spotted Arnoldo immediately.
Dressed in his pristinely
white chef’s jacket paired
with black slacks, he stood by
a small table for two in the
back, talking to the woman
I’d come to see.
Her head turned toward me
as I approached, her long
dark hair sliding across her
shoulder. Her blue eyes lit
brightly for a moment when
she spotted me, and then that
light was quickly banked. Her
smile when she greeted me
was cool and more than a
little smug.
“Corinne.” I greeted her
with a nod before shaking
hands with Arnoldo. The
restaurant he ran and I backed
was crowded with lunch
guests, the buzz of numerous
conversations loud enough to
drown out the instrumental
Italian-themed music piping
through recessed speakers.
Arnoldo excused himself to
see to the kitchen, lifting
Corinne’s hand to his lips in
farewell. Before he walked
away, he shot me a look that I
understood to mean we’d talk
later.
I took the seat across from
Corinne. “I appreciate your
taking the time to see me.”
“Your invitation was a
pleasant surprise.”
“I don’t believe it was
unexpected.” I leaned back,
absorbing the soft lilt of
Corinne’s speech. While
Eva’s throaty voice stirred a
deep craving, Corinne’s had
always soothed me.
Her smile widened as she
brushed at an invisible speck
on the plunging neckline of
her red dress. “No, I suppose
not.”
Irritated by the game she
was playing, I spoke curtly.
“What are you doing? You
value your privacy as much
as I do mine.”
Corinne’s lips flattened
into a firm line. “I thought the
exact same thing when I first
saw that video of you and
Eva arguing in the park. You
say I don’t know you, but I
do, and having your private
life splashed all over the
tabloids isn’t something you
would ever allow under
normal circumstances.”
“What’s normal?” I shot
back, unable to deny that I
was a different man with Eva.
I’d never indulged women
who tested me expecting
some grand gesture. If they
pursued me aggressively
enough, I let them catch me
for a night. With Eva, I’d
always been the one chasing.
“That’s exactly my point—
you don’t remember. Because
you’re wrapped up in a
passionate affair and you
can’t see beyond it.”
“There is nothing beyond
it, Corinne. I will be with her
until I die.”
She sighed. “You think so
now, but stormy relationships
don’t last, Gideon. They burn
themselves out. You like
order and calm, and you
won’t have that with her.
Ever. Somewhere inside you,
you know that.”
Her words struck home.
She had unwittingly echoed
my own thoughts on the
subject.
A server came by our table.
Corinne ordered a salad; I
ordered a drink—a double.
“So you’ve sold a tell-all to
do … what?” I asked, when
the server walked away. “Get
back at me? Hurt Eva?”
“No. I want you to
remember.”
“This isn’t the way.”
“What is the way?”
I held her gaze. “It’s over,
Corinne. Exposing your
memories of us isn’t going to
change that.”
“Maybe not,” she
conceded, sounding so sad it
sent a pang of regret through
me. “But you said you never
loved me. At the very least,
I’ll prove that wrong. I gave
you comfort. Contentment.
You were happy with me. I
don’t see that same sort of
tranquillity when you’re with
her. You can’t tell me you
feel it.”
“Everything you’re saying
tells me you don’t care if I
end up with you. But if
you’re leaving Giroux, maybe
you care about the money.
How much did they pay you
to prostitute your ‘love’ for
me?”
Her chin lifted. “That’s not
why I’m writing the book.”
“You just want to be sure I
don’t end up with Eva.”
“I just want you to be
happy, Gideon. And since
you’ve met her, I’ve seen you
be anything but.”
How would Eva take the
book when she read it? No
better, I imagined, than I was
taking “Golden.”
Corinne’s gaze dropped to
my left hand, which rested on
the tabletop. “You gave Eva
your mother’s engagement
ring.”
“It hasn’t been hers for a
long time.”
She took a sip of the wine
she’d had on the table when I
joined her. “Did you have it
when you and I were
together?”
“Yes.”
She flinched.
“You can tell yourself that
Eva and I are incompatible,” I
said tightly, “that we’re either
fighting or fucking with
nothing of substance in
between. But the truth is that
she’s the other half of me and
what you’re doing is going to
hurt her, which will hurt me.
I’ll buy you out of the
publishing contract if you’ll
withdraw the book.”
She stared at me for a long
minute. “I … I can’t,
Gideon.”
“Tell me why.”
“You’re asking me to let
you go. This is a way for me
to do that.”
I leaned forward. “I’m
asking you, Corinne, if you
feel anything for me at all, to
please drop this.”
“Gideon …”
“If you don’t, you’re going
to turn what were good
memories for me into
something I hate.”
Her turquoise eyes shone
with tears. “I’m sorry.”
I pushed back from the
table and stood. “You will
be.”
Turning away, I walked out
of the restaurant to the
waiting Bentley. Angus
opened the door, his gaze
shifting to look beyond me
into Tableau One’s massive
front window.
“Damn it.” I slid into the
back. “God fucking damn it!”
People who felt I’d
wronged them in some way
were crawling out of the
shadows like spiders, lured by
the presence of Eva in my
life.
She was my biggest
vulnerability, one I wasn’t
hiding well. And that was
becoming a problem I had to
get a handle on. Christopher,
Anne, Landon, Corinne …
they were only the beginning.
There were others who had
grievances against me. Still
more who held grudges
toward my father.
I’d long dared them all to
come at me, enjoying the
challenge. Now, the bastards
were coming at me through
my wife. All at once. And I
was being stretched thin
because of it. If I didn’t have
my guard up completely, my
focus absolute, I would leave
Eva open and unprotected.
Whatever I had to do, I had
to prevent that.
“I still want to see you
tonight,” Eva said, her
seductive voice drifting
through the phone receiver
like smoke.
“That’s not in question,” I
told her, leaning back in my
desk chair. Outside the
windows, the sun hung lower
in the sky. The workday was
over. Somewhere in the
madness of the week, August
had given way to September.
“You deal with Cary, I’ll sit
down with Arnoldo, and you
and I will start the weekend
when we’re done.”
“God, this week just flew
by. I need to work out. I
skipped too many days.”
“Spar with me tomorrow.”
She laughed. “Yeah, right.”
“I’m not joking.” I thought
of Eva in her sports bra and
body-hugging pants, and my
dick stirred with interest.
“I can’t fight you!” she
protested.
“Of course you can.”
“You know too much.
You’re too good.”
“Let’s put those selfdefense
skills of yours to the
test, angel.” The idea I’d
thrown out on a whim
suddenly seemed like the best
one I’d had all day. “I want to
know you can take care of
yourself in the unlikely case
that you have to.”
She never would, but it
would give me peace of mind
to know that she could get
away from a threat.
“I’ve got wedding stuff
tomorrow, but I’ll think about
it,” she said. “Hang on.”
I heard the car door open
and Eva greet her doorman.
She said hi to her concierge,
and then I heard the ding of
an arriving elevator in her
lobby.
“You know”—she sighed
—“I’m putting on a brave
face for Cary, but I’m
worried about what’s going to
happen with Trey. If he walks
out, I think Cary just might
totally self-destruct.”
“He’s asking a lot,” I
warned her, hearing another
ding from the elevator.
“Cary’s basically telling this
guy that he’s got a pregnant
sidepiece that he intends to
hang on to. No, scratch that.
He’s saying that Trey is going
to be the sidepiece. I can’t see
that going over well with
anyone.”
“I know.”
“I’ll have my phone on me
all night. Call me if you need
me.”
“I always need you. I’m
home, so I have to go. See
you later. I love you.”
Would those words always
hit me hard enough to steal
my breath?
We hung up just as a
familiar figure rounded the
corner leading to my office. I
stood as Mark Garrity
reached my open doorway,
and I met him halfway with
my hand extended.
“Mark, thank you for
making time for me.”
He smiled and shook my
hand in a strong grip. “I’m
the one feeling thankful, Mr.
Cross. There are a large
number of people in this city
—in the world, actually—
who’d kill to be where I am
right now.”
“Call me Gideon, please.” I
gestured toward the seating
area. “How’s Steven?”
“He’s doing great, thank
you. I’m beginning to think
he missed a calling as a
wedding planner.”
I smiled. “Eva’s about to
dig into that this weekend.”
Unbuttoning his suit jacket,
Mark tugged up the legs of
his slacks and sat on the sofa.
His gray suit contrasted well
with his dark skin and striped
tie, pulling together the
appearance of an urban
professional on the rise.
“If she has half as much
fun with it as Steven,” he
said, “she’ll have the time of
her life.”
“Let’s hope she doesn’t
have too much fun,” I
drawled, remaining on my
feet. “I’d like to get past the
planning and into the actual
wedding.”
Mark laughed.
“Can I get you something
to drink?” I asked.
“I’m good, thanks.”
“Okay. I’ll make this
quick.” I took a seat. “I asked
you to meet me after work,
because it wouldn’t be
appropriate for me to offer
you a position with Cross
Industries while you’re on
Waters Field and Leaman’s
time.”
His brows shot up.
I let that sink in for a
second or two. “Cross
Industries has a number of
diverse international
holdings, with a
concentration on real estate,
entertainment, and premium
brands—or assets we believe
we can elevate to that status.”
“Like Kingsman Vodka.”
“Precisely. For the most
part, advertising and
marketing campaigns are
managed on the ground level,
but brand overhauls or
adjustments to messaging are
approved here. Due to the
diversity I mentioned, we’re
always reviewing new
strategies for rebranding or
strengthening an established
brand. We could use you.”
“Wow.” Mark rubbed his
palms over his knees. “I’m
not sure what I was
expecting, but this has caught
me off guard.”
“I’ll pay you twice what
you’re making, to start.”
“That’s a hell of an offer.”
“I’m not a man who likes
the word no.”
His grin flashed. “I doubt
you hear it very often. I guess
this means Eva is leaving
Waters Field and Leaman?”
“She hasn’t made that
decision yet.”
“No?” His brows shot up
again. “If I leave, she’ll lose
her job.”
“And gain another one
here, of course.” I kept my
replies as brief and
unrevealing as possible. I
wanted his cooperation, not
questions he might not like
the answers to.
“Is she waiting for me to
agree before she takes any
steps?”
“Your decision will be a
catalyst.”
Mark ran a hand over his
tie. “I’m both flattered and
excited, but—”
“I understand it’s not a
move you were planning on
making,” I interjected
smoothly. “You’re happy
where you’re at, and feel a
measure of job security. So
I’m prepared to guarantee
you the position—and
reasonable bonuses and
annual raises—for the next
three years, barring any
misconduct on your part.”
Leaning forward, I set my
fingers on the folder that
Scott had left atop the table. I
pushed it toward Mark. “All
the information is laid out in
detail in this. Take it home
with you, discuss it with
Steven, and let me know your
decision on Monday.”
“Monday?”
I stood. “I expect you’ll
want to give Waters Field and
Leaman ample notice and I
don’t have a problem with
that, but I’ll need to have
your commitment as soon as
possible.”
He picked up the folder
and rose to his feet. “What if
I have questions?”
“Call me. My card is in the
folder.” I glanced at the
watch on my wrist. “I’m
sorry. I have another
appointment.”
“Oh, yes, of course.” Mark
accepted my extended hand.
“I’m sorry. This happened so
fast I feel like I haven’t quite
processed it all yet. I
understand you’ve offered me
a fantastic opportunity,
though, and I appreciate
that.”
“You’re good at what you
do,” I told him honestly. “I
wouldn’t make the offer if
you weren’t worth it. Think
about it, then say yes.”
He laughed. “I’ll give it
some serious thought and
you’ll hear from me on
Monday.”
As he left, my head turned
toward the building that
housed LanCorp’s
headquarters. Landon
wouldn’t find me with my
back turned again.
“SHE started crying the
minute you walked out.”
I looked at Arnoldo over
the rim of my tumbler, which
held two fingers of scotch. I
swallowed, then asked, “Do
you want me to feel guilty
about that?”
“No. I wouldn’t feel sorry
for her, either. But I thought
you should know that
Corinne isn’t completely
heartless.”
“I never thought she was. I
just thought she’d given that
heart to her husband.”
Arnoldo lifted one shoulder
in a shrug. Dressed in wellworn
jeans and a tucked-in
white dress shirt that was
open at the collar and rolled
up at the cuffs, he was
drawing a lot of female
attention.
The bar was packed, but
our section of the VIP
balcony was guarded well,
keeping the rest of the patrons
at bay. Arnoldo sat on the
crescent-shaped sofa where
Cary had sat the first night I’d
met with Eva outside the
Crossfire. The place would
always hold strong memories
because of her. It was that
night when I realized she was
changing everything.
“You look tired,” Arnoldo
said.
“It’s been one of those
weeks.” I caught his look.
“No, it’s not Eva.”
“Do you want to talk about
it?”
“Nothing to say, really. I
should’ve been smarter. I let
the world see how much she
means to me.”
“Passionate kisses on the
street, even more passionate
fights in the park.” He smiled
ruefully. “What is it they say?
Wearing your heart on your
sleeve?”
“I opened the door, now
everyone wants to walk
through it. She’s the most
direct way to fuck with my
head, and everyone knows
it.”
“Including Brett Kline?”
“He’s not an issue any
longer.”
Arnoldo studied me and
must have seen whatever he
needed to. He nodded. “I’m
glad, my friend.”
“So am I.” I took another
drink. “What’s new with
you?”
He waved off the question
with a careless sweep of his
hand, his gaze sliding around
us to take in the women
nearby who were swaying to
the music of Lana Del Rey.
“The restaurant is doing well,
as you know.”
“Yes, I’m very pleased.
Exceeded profit projections in
every way.”
“We just filmed some
promotional teasers for the
new season earlier this week.
Once the Food Network starts
airing them and the new
episodes, we should see a
nice boost in business.”
“I can always say I knew
you when.”
He laughed and clinked his
glass to mine when I held it
up in a toast.
We were back on track,
which settled some of the
unrest I’d been feeling. I
didn’t lean on Arnoldo the
way Eva leaned on her
friends or Cary leaned on her,
but Arnoldo was important to
me all the same. I didn’t have
many people in my life who
were close to me. Finding the
rhythm he and I had lost was
at least one major victory in a
week that had seemed like a
losing battle.

“OH MY GOD,” I moaned
around a bite of chocolate
toffee cupcake, “this is
divine.”
Kristin, the wedding
planner, beamed. “It’s one of
my favorites, too. Hold on,
though. The butter vanilla is
even better.”
“Vanilla over chocolate?”
My gaze slid over the
yummies on the coffee table.
“No way.”
“I would usually agree,”
Kristin said, making a note,
“but this bakery made me a
convert. The lemon is also
very good.”
The early-afternoon light
poured in through the
massive windows that made
up one side of my mother’s
private sitting room,
illuminating her pale gold
curls and porcelain skin.
She’d redecorated recently,
opting for soft gray-blue
walls that lent a new energy
to the space—and
complemented her well.
It was one of her talents,
showcasing herself in the best
light. It was also one of her
major flaws, in my opinion.
She cared so damn much
about appearances.
I didn’t understand how
my mom could not get bored
with decorating to the latest
trends, even if it did seem to
take over a year to cycle
through every room and
hallway in Stanton’s sixthousand-
plus-square-foot
penthouse.
My one meeting with
Blaire Ash had been enough
to tell me that the decorating
gene had skipped my
generation. I’d been
interested in his ideas but
couldn’t get worked up over
the details.
While I popped another
mini cupcake into my mouth
with my fingers, my mother
daintily speared one of the
coin-sized cakes with a fork.
“What are your floral
arrangement preferences?”
Kristin asked, uncrossing and
recrossing long, coffee-hued
legs. Her Jimmy Choo heels
were elegant but still sexy;
her Diane von Furstenberg
wrap dress was vintage and
classic. She wore her
shoulder-length dark hair in
tight curls that framed and
flattered her narrow face, and
pale pink gloss highlighted
full, wide lips.
She looked fierce and
fabulous, and I’d liked her the
moment we met.
“Red,” I said, wiping
frosting from the corner of
my mouth. “Anything red.”
“Red?” My mother gave an
emphatic shake of her head.
“How garish, Eva. It’s your
first wedding. Go with white,
cream, and gold.”
I stared at her. “How many
weddings do you expect me
to have?”
“That’s not what I meant.
You’re a first-time bride.”
“I’m not talking about
wearing a red dress,” I
argued. “I’m just saying the
primary accent color should
be red.”
“I don’t see how that will
work, honey. And I’ve put
together enough weddings to
know.”
I remembered my mother
going through the wedding
planning process before, each
successive nuptial more
elaborate and memorable than
the last. Never overdone and
always tasteful. Beautiful
weddings for a youthful,
beautiful bride. I hoped I
aged with half as much grace,
because Gideon was only
going to get hotter as time
went on. He was just that
kind of man.
“Let me show you what red
can look like, Monica,”
Kristin said, pulling a leather
portfolio out of her bag. “Red
can be amazing, especially
with evening weddings. The
important thing is that the
ceremony and reception
represent both the bride and
groom. To have a truly
memorable day, it’s
important that we visually
convey their style, history,
and hopes for the future.”
My mother accepted the
extended portfolio and
glanced at the collage of
photos on the page. “Eva …
you can’t be serious.”
I shot a look of
appreciation at Kristin for
having my back, especially
when she’d come on board
expecting my mother to be
footing the bill. Of course, the
fact that I was marrying
Gideon Cross probably
helped sway her to my side.
Using him as a future
reference would certainly
help her draw new clientele.
“I’m sure there’s a
compromise, Mom.” At least
I hoped so. I hadn’t dropped
the biggest bomb on her yet.
“Do we have an idea of the
budget?” Kristin asked.
And there it was …
I saw my mom’s mouth
open in slow motion and my
heart lurched into a
semipanicked beat. “Fifty
thousand for the ceremony
itself,” I blurted out. “Minus
the cost of the dress.”
Both women turned wide
eyes toward me.
My mom gave an
incredulous laugh, her hand
lifting to touch the Cartier
trinity necklace that hung
between her breasts. “My
God, Eva. What a time to
make jokes!”
“Dad’s paying for the
wedding, Mom,” I told her,
my voice strengthening now
that the moment I’d dreaded
had passed.
She blinked at me, her blue
eyes revealing—just for an
instant—a sweet softening.
Then her jaw tightened.
“Your dress alone will cost
more than that. The flowers,
the venue …”
“We’re getting married on
the beach,” I said, the idea
just coming to me. “North
Carolina. The Outer Banks.
At the house Gideon and I
just bought. We’ll only need
enough flowers for the
members of the wedding
party.”
“You don’t understand.”
My mom glanced at Kristin
for support. “There’s no way
that would work. You’d have
no control.”
Meaning she wouldn’t.
“Unpredictable weather,”
she went on, “sand
everywhere … Plus, asking
everyone to travel that far out
of the city will make it likely
some won’t be able to attend.
And where would everyone
stay?”
“Who’s everyone? I told
you, the ceremony is going to
be small, for friends and
family only. Gideon’s taking
care of travel. I’m sure he’d
be happy to take care of
lodging arrangements, too.”
“I can help with that,”
Kristin said.
“Don’t encourage her!” my
mother snapped.
“Don’t be rude!” I shot
back. “I think you’re
forgetting that it’s my
wedding. Not a publicity op.”
My mom took a deep,
steadying breath. “Eva, I
think it’s very sweet that you
want to accommodate your
father this way, but he
doesn’t understand what a
burden he’s placing on you
by asking this. Even if I
matched him dollar for dollar,
it wouldn’t be enough—”
“It’s plenty.” My hands
linked tightly together in my
lap, pressing the rings on my
fingers uncomfortably against
the bone. “And it’s not a
burden.”
“You’re going to offend
people. You have to
understand that a man in
Gideon’s position needs to
take every opportunity to
solidify his network. He’s
going to want—”
“—to elope,” I bit out,
frustrated by the too-familiar
clash of our viewpoints. “If
he had his way, we’d run off
somewhere and get married
on a remote beach with a
couple of witnesses and a
great view.”
“He may say that—”
“No, Mother. Trust me.
That’s exactly what he would
do.”
“Um, if I may.” Kristin
leaned forward. “We can
make this work, Monica.
Many celebrity weddings are
private affairs. A limited
budget will keep us focused
on the details. And, if Gideon
and Eva are open to it, we can
arrange to have select
photographs sold to the
celebrity lifestyle magazines,
with the profits going to
charity.”
“Oh, I like that!” I said,
even as I wondered how that
could work with the fortyeight-
hour exclusive deal
Gideon had offered Deanna
Johnson.
My mom looked
distraught. “I’ve dreamed of
your wedding since the day
you were born,” she said
quietly. “I always wanted you
to have something fit for a
princess.”
“Mom.” I reached over and
took her hand in mine. “You
can go wild with the
reception, okay? Do whatever
you want. Skip the red, invite
the world, whatever. As for
the wedding, isn’t it enough
that I found my prince?”
Her hand tightened on
mine and she looked at me
with tears in her blue eyes. “I
guess it’ll have to be.”
I’D just slid into the back of
the Benz when my
smartphone started ringing.
Pulling it out of my purse, I
looked at the screen and saw
it was Trey. My stomach
twisted a little.
I couldn’t get the shattered
look on his face last night out
of my mind. I’d stayed tucked
away in the kitchen while
Cary sat with Trey in the
living room and told him
about Tatiana and the baby. I
had put a pot roast in the oven
and sat at the breakfast bar
with my tablet, reading a
book while staying in Cary’s
line of sight. Even in profile,
I could see how hard Trey
had taken the news.
Still, he’d stayed for dinner
and then overnight, so I
hoped things would work out
in the end. At least he hadn’t
just walked out.
“Hi, Trey,” I answered.
“How are you?”
“Hey, Eva.” He sighed
heavily. “I have no idea how I
am. How are you doing?”
“Well, I’m just leaving my
mother’s place after spending
hours talking about the
wedding. It didn’t go as badly
as it could have, but it
could’ve been smoother. But
that’s pretty usual when
dealing with my mom.”
“Ah … well, you’ve got a
lot on your plate. I’m sorry to
bother you.”
“Trey. It’s fine. I’m glad
you called. If you want to
talk, I’m here.”
“Could we get together,
maybe? Whenever it’s
convenient for you?”
“How’s now?”
“Really? I’m at a street fair
on the west side. My sister
dragged me out and I was
miserable company. She
ditched me a few minutes ago
and now I’m wondering what
the hell I’m doing here.”
“I can meet you.”
“I’m between Eightysecond
and Eighty-third,
close to Amsterdam. It’s
packed here, just FYI.”
“Okay, hang tight. I’ll see
you in a few.”
“Thanks, Eva.”
We hung up and I caught
Raúl’s gaze in the rearview
mirror. “Amsterdam and
Eighty-second. Close as you
can get.”
He nodded.
“Thanks.” I looked out the
window as we turned a
corner, taking in the city on a
sunny Saturday afternoon.
The pace of Manhattan was
slower on the weekends, the
clothes more casual, and the
street vendors more plentiful.
Women in sandals and light
summer dresses windowshopped
leisurely, while men
in shorts and T-shirts traveled
in groups, taking in the
women and discussing
whatever it was men
discussed. Dogs of all sizes
pranced on the ends of
leashes, while children in
strollers kicked up their heels
or napped. An elderly couple
shuffled along hand in hand,
still lost in the wonder of
each other after years of
familiarity.
I was speed-dialing Gideon
before I realized I’d thought
of it.
“Angel,” he answered.
“Are you on your way
home?”
“Not quite. I’m done at my
mom’s, but I’m going to meet
Trey.”
“How long will that take?”
“I’m not sure. Not more
than an hour, I think. God, I
hope he doesn’t tell me he’s
done with Cary.”
“How did it go with your
mother?”
“I told her we were getting
married on the beach by the
Outer Banks house.” I
paused. “I’m sorry. I
should’ve asked you first.”
“I think that’s an excellent
idea.” His raspy voice took
on the special timbre that told
me he was moved.
“She asked me how we’re
planning on lodging
everyone. I kinda dropped
that on you and the wedding
planner.”
“That’s fine. We’ll work
something out.”
Love for him spread
through me in a warm rush.
“Thank you.”
“So the big hurdle’s behind
you,” he said, understanding
as he so often did.
“Well, I don’t know about
that. She got all teary about it.
You know, she had big
dreams that aren’t coming
true. I hope she lets them go
and gets on board.”
“What about her family?
We haven’t talked about
making arrangements for
them to come.”
I shrugged, then
remembered he couldn’t see
me. “They’re not invited. The
only things I know about
them are what I found with a
Google search. They
disowned my mom when she
got pregnant with me, so
they’ve never been a part of
my life.”
“All right, then,” he said
smoothly. “I’ve got a surprise
for you when you get home.”
“Oh?” My mood instantly
brightened. “Will you give
me a hint?”
“Of course not. You’ll
have to hurry home if you’re
curious.”
I pouted. “Tease.”
“Teases don’t deliver. I
do.”
My toes curled at the rough
velvet of his voice. “I’ll be
home as soon as I can.”
“I’ll be waiting,” he
purred.
THE traffic near the fair was
impossible. Raúl left the Benz
in the garage beneath my
apartment building, then
walked me over to the street
fair.
When we were half a block
away, I started smelling the
food and my mouth watered.
Music drifted in the air and
when we reached Amsterdam
Avenue, I saw that it came
from a woman singing on a
small stage for a packed
audience.
Vendors lined either side
of the overflowing street,
their wares and heads
shielded from the sun by
white tent tops. From scarves
and hats, to jewelry and art,
to fresh produce and
multinational eats, there was
nothing one could want that
couldn’t be found.
It took me a few minutes to
spot Trey in the crowd. I
found him sitting on steps not
too far from the corner we’d
agreed upon. He was dressed
in loose jeans and an olivehued
T-shirt, with sunglasses
perched on the crooked
bridge of his once-broken
nose. His blond hair was as
unruly as ever, his attractive
mouth tightened into a firm
line.
He stood when he saw me,
holding out his hand for me
to shake. I pulled him into a
hug instead, holding him until
I felt him relax and hug me
back. Life flowed by around
us—New Yorkers were
comfortable with all sorts of
public displays. Raúl moved a
discreet distance away.
“I’m a fucking mess,” Trey
muttered against my
shoulder.
“You’re normal.” I pulled
back and gestured toward the
steps where I’d found him.
“Anyone would be reeling
right now.”
He sat down on the middle
step. I perched next to him.
“I don’t think I can do this,
Eva. I don’t think I should. I
want someone in my life fulltime,
someone who’s there to
support me while I get
through school, then try to
build my practice. Cary’s
going to be supporting that
model instead and fitting me
in when he can. How am I not
going to resent that?”
“That’s a valid question,” I
said, stretching out my legs in
front of me. “You know Cary
won’t be sure the baby is his
until a paternity test is done.”
Trey shook his head. “I
don’t think it’ll matter. He
seems invested.”
“I think it’ll matter. Maybe
he won’t just walk away,
maybe he’ll play uncle or
something. I don’t know. For
now, we have to go with the
assumption that he’s the dad,
but maybe he’s not. It’s a
possibility.”
“So you’re telling me to
hang in there for another six
months?”
“No. If you want me to
give you answers, I don’t
have any. All I can tell you
for sure is that Cary loves
you, more than I’ve ever seen
him love anyone. If he loses
you, it’s going to break him.
I’m not trying to guilt you
into staying with him. I just
think you should know that if
you leave, you’re not the only
one who’ll be hurting.”
“How is that helpful?”
“Maybe it’s not.” I set my
hand on his knee. “Maybe
I’m just small enough to find
that comforting. If Gideon
and I didn’t work out, I’d
want to know he was as
miserable as I was.”
Trey’s mouth curved in a
sad smile. “Yeah, I see your
point. Would you stay with
him if you found out he’d
knocked someone else up?
Someone he was sleeping
with while dating you?”
“I thought about that. It’s
hard for me to imagine not
being with Gideon. If we
weren’t exclusive at the time
and the woman was in his
past, if he was with me and
not her, maybe I could handle
it.”
I watched a woman hang
yet another bag of purchases
onto the overburdened handle
of her kid’s stroller. “But if
he was mostly with her and
seeing me on the side … I
think I’d walk.”
It was tough being honest
when the truth was the
opposite of what Cary would
want me to say, but I felt like
it was the right thing to do.
“Thanks, Eva.”
“For what it’s worth, I
wouldn’t think less of you if
you toughed it out with Cary.
It’s not weak to stand by the
person you love when they’re
trying to fix a big mistake,
and it’s not weak to decide to
put yourself first. Whatever
decision you make, I’ll still
think you’re a helluva guy.”
Leaning into me, he rested
his head on my shoulder.
“Thanks, Eva.”
I linked my fingers with
his. “You’re welcome.”
“I’LL go get the car and pull it
around,” Raúl said, as we
entered the lobby of my
apartment building.
“Okay. I’m just going to
check the mail.” I waved at
the concierge as we passed
the desk. I turned into the
mailroom, while Raúl headed
to the elevator.
Sliding my key into the
lock, I pulled the brass door
open and bent low to peer
inside. There were a few
postcard advertisements and
nothing else, which saved me
a trip upstairs. I slid them out,
tossed them in the nearby
trash can, then shut and
locked the mailbox.
I headed back into the
lobby just in time to catch a
woman exiting the building.
Her spiky red hair caught my
attention and held it. I stared
hard, waiting for her to turn
onto the street, hoping I’d
catch a glimpse of her profile.
My breath caught. The hair
was familiar from a Google
image search. The face I
remembered from the shelter
fund-raiser Gideon and I had
attended a few weeks back.
Then she was gone.
I ran after her, but when I
reached the sidewalk she was
already sliding into the back
of a black town car.
“Hey!” I shouted.
The car sped off, leaving
me staring after it.
“Everything all right?”
I turned to face Louie, the
weekend doorman. “Do you
know who that was?”
He shook his head. “She
doesn’t live here.”
Going back inside, I asked
the concierge the same
question.
“A redhead?” she asked,
looking perplexed. “We
haven’t had any visitors who
came in without a tenant
today, so I haven’t really paid
attention.”
“Hmm. Okay, thank you.”
“Your car’s here, Eva,”
Louie said from the doorway.
I thanked the concierge and
headed out to Raúl. I spent
the ride between my place
and Gideon’s thinking about
Anne Lucas. By the time I
stepped out of the private
elevator into the foyer of the
penthouse, my spinning
thoughts had me distracted.
Gideon was waiting for
me. Dressed in worn jeans
and a Columbia T-shirt, he
looked so young and
handsome. Then he flashed
me a smile and I almost
forgot the world altogether.
“Angel,” he purred,
crossing the black-and-white
checkerboard flooring on bare
feet. He had that look in his
eye I knew well. “Come
here.”
I walked right into his open
arms, cuddling up tightly to
his hard body. I breathed him
in. “You’re going to think
I’m crazy,” I mumbled
against his chest, “but I could
swear I just saw Anne Lucas
in the lobby of my building.”
He stiffened. I knew the
shrink wasn’t his favorite
person.
“When?” he asked tightly.
“Twenty minutes ago,
maybe. Right before I came
over here.”
Releasing me, he reached
into his back pocket and
pulled out his smartphone.
His other hand caught mine
and pulled me into the living
room.
“Mrs. Cross just saw Anne
Lucas in her apartment
building,” he said to whoever
answered.
“I think I did,” I corrected,
frowning at his hard tone.
But he wasn’t listening to
me. “Find out,” he ordered,
before hanging up.
“Gideon. What’s going
on?”
He led us to the couch and
sat. I settled next to him,
putting my purse down on the
coffee table.
“I saw Anne the other
day,” he explained, holding
on to my hand. “Raúl
confirmed that the woman
who spoke to you at the fundraiser
was her. She admitted
it, and I warned her to stay
away from you, but she
won’t. She wants to hurt me
and she knows she can do
that if she hurts you.”
“Okay.” I processed that.
“You need to tell Raúl the
moment you see her
anywhere. Even if you just
think it’s her.”
“Hold on a minute, ace.
You went to see her the other
day and didn’t tell me?”
“I’m telling you now.”
“Why didn’t you tell me
then?”
He exhaled roughly. “It
was the day Chris came
over.”
“Oh.”
“Yeah.”
I gnawed on my lower lip a
minute. “How would she hurt
me?”
“I don’t know. It’s enough
for me that she wants to.”
“Like would she break my
leg? My nose?”
“I doubt she’d resort to
violence,” he said dryly. “It
would be more fun for her to
play mind games. Showing
up where you are. Letting you
catch glimpses of her.”
Which was more insidious.
“So that you’ll go to her.
That’s what she really
wants,” I muttered. “She
wants to see you.”
“I won’t be obliging her. I
said what I needed to.”
Looking down at our
joined hands, I played with
his wedding band. “Anne,
Corinne, Deanna … It’s a bit
crazy, Gideon. I mean, I don’t
think this is normal for most
men. How many more
women are going to lose their
minds over you?”
He shot me a look that was
patently not amused. “I don’t
know what’s gotten into
Corinne. None of what she’s
done since she returned to
New York is like her. I don’t
know if it’s the medication
she was on, the miscarriage,
her divorce …”
“She’s getting divorced?”
“Don’t take that tone, Eva.
It doesn’t make a damn bit of
difference to me if she’s
married or single. I’m
married. That’s never going
to change, and I’m not a man
who cheats. I have more
respect for you—and me—
than to be that kind of
husband.”
I leaned forward, offering
my mouth, and he took it in a
soft, sweet kiss. He had said
exactly what I needed to hear.
Gideon pulled back,
nuzzling his nose against
mine. “As for the other two
… You have to understand
that Deanna was collateral
damage. Fuck. My entire life
has been a war zone and
some people have gotten
caught in the line of fire.”
I cupped his jaw, trying to
stroke the tension away with
soothing brushes of my
thumb. I knew just what he
meant.
He swallowed hard. “If I
hadn’t used Deanna to send a
message to Anne that the
door was closed between us,
she would’ve been just a onenight
stand. Over and done
with.”
“But she’s okay now?”
“I think so.” His fingertips
brushed my cheek, the touch
reflecting the one I’d given
him. “Since I’m sharing, I’ll
say that I don’t think she’d
turn me down if I tried to
hook up—which I won’t—
but I don’t think she falls in
the woman-scorned category
any longer.”
“Yeah, I knew she’d hit the
sheets with you again if she
could. Not that I blame her.
Do you have to be so damn
good in bed? Isn’t it enough
that you’re hot, and have an
amazing body and a huge
cock?”
He shook his head, clearly
exasperated. “It’s not huge.”
“Whatever. You’re hung.
And you know how to use it.
And women don’t get
awesome sex very often, so
when we do, we can go a
little nuts over it. I guess that
answers my question about
Anne, since she had you
repeatedly.”
“She never had me.”
Gideon sat back, slouching.
Scowling. “At some point
you’re going to get sick of
hearing what an asshole I
am.”
I curled into his side,
resting my head on his
shoulder. “You’re not the first
insanely hot guy on the planet
to use women. And you
won’t be the last.”
“It was different with
Anne,” he grumbled. “It
wasn’t just about her
husband.”
I stilled, then forced myself
to relax so that I didn’t make
him any more nervous than
he already was.
He sucked in a quick, deep
breath. “She reminds me of
Hugh sometimes,” he said in
a rush. “The way she moves,
some of the things she says
… There’s a familial
resemblance. And more. I
can’t explain it.”
“Then don’t.”
“Sometimes the line
between them blurred in my
mind. It was like I was
punishing Hugh through
Anne. I did things to her I’ve
never done with anyone else.
Things that made me feel sick
when I thought about them
later.”
“Gideon.” I slid my arm
around his waist.
He hadn’t told me this.
He’d said before that it was
Dr. Terrence Lucas he was
punishing, and I was sure that
was part of it. But now I
knew it wasn’t all of it.
Gideon sat back. “It was
twisted between Anne and
me. I twisted her. If I could
go back and do things
differently—”
“We’ll deal with it. I’m
glad you told me.”
“Had to. Listen, angel, you
need to tell Raúl the moment
you see her anywhere. Even
if you’re not sure. And don’t
go anywhere alone. I’ll figure
out how to deal with her. In
the meantime, I need to know
that you’re safe.”
“Okay.” I wasn’t sure how
that plan would work over the
long haul. We lived in the
same city with the woman
and her husband, and Lucas
himself had approached me
before. They were a problem
and we needed a solution.
But we weren’t going to
come up with it today.
Saturday. One of the two
days of the week I most
looked forward to because I
got to spend so much private
time with my husband.
“So,” I began, sliding my
hand up beneath Gideon’s
shirt to touch his warm skin.
“Where’s my surprise?”
“Well …” The sexy rasp in
his voice deepened. “Let’s
wait a bit before that. How
about we start with some
wine?”
Tilting my head back, I
looked up at him. “Are you
trying to seduce me, ace?”
He kissed my nose.
“Always.”
“Umm … Go right ahead.”
I knew something was up
when Gideon didn’t join me
in the shower. The only time
he missed an opportunity to
put his hands on me while
drenched and dripping was in
the mornings, after he’d
already had his way with me.
When I came back out to
the living room dressed in
shorts and tank top sans bra,
he was waiting for me with a
glass of red wine. We settled
on the couch with 3 Days to
Kill, which only proved to me
that my husband knew me
well. It was just the sort of
movie I enjoyed—a bit funny,
a lot over-the-top. And it had
Kevin Costner, who was
always a win for me.
Still, as much fun as I had
just being lazy with Gideon,
the anticipation started to
make me twitchy as the hours
passed. And Gideon, the
devious man, knew it. He
built on it. He kept my
wineglass full and his hands
on me—tangled in my hair,
brushing over my shoulder,
running along my thigh.
By nine o’clock, I was
crawling all over him. I slid
into his lap and pressed my
lips to his throat, my tongue
darting out to stroke over his
pulse. I felt it leap, then
accelerate, but he made no
move in response. He sat as if
absorbed in the rerun we’d
channel-surfed to after the
movie ended.
“Gideon?” I whispered in
my fuck-me voice, my hand
sliding between his legs to
find him as hard and ready as
always.
“Hmm?”
I caught the lobe of his ear
in my teeth, tugging gently.
“Would you mind if I fucked
myself on your big cock
while you’re watching TV?”
His hand rubbed absently
down my back. “I might not
be able to see around you,” he
replied, sounding distracted.
“Maybe you better get on
your knees and suck it
instead.”
Pulling back, I gaped at
him. His eyes laughed at me.
I shoved at his shoulder.
“You’re terrible!”
“My poor angel,” he
crooned. “Are you horny?”
“What do you think?” I
gestured at my chest. My
nipples were hard and tight,
straining against the thin
cotton in a silent demand for
his attention.
Cupping my shoulders, he
pulled me closer and caught
the tip of my breast in his
teeth, his tongue stroking
softly. I moaned.
He released me, his eyes
now so dark they were like
sapphires. “Are you wet?”
I was getting there, fast.
Whenever Gideon looked at
me like that, my body
softened for him, grew moist
and eager. “Why don’t you
find out?” I teased.
“Show me.”
The authoritative bite in his
command made me hotter. I
slid off him carefully, feeling
inexplicably shy. He pushed
the coffee table back with one
foot, giving me more room to
stand in front of him. His
gaze slid over me, his face
expressionless. The lack of
encouragement made me
even more anxious, which I
guessed was his intention.
He was pushing in that way
he had.
Rolling my shoulders back,
I caught his gaze with my
own and ran my tongue along
my bottom lip. His eyes
became heavy-lidded. I slid
my thumbs beneath the
elastic waistband of my
athletic shorts and pushed
them down, wriggling my
hips a little to make it look
more like a striptease and less
like I was feeling awkward.
“No panties,” he
murmured, his gaze on my
sex. “You’re a bad girl,
angel.”
I pouted. “I’m trying to be
good.”
“Open yourself for me,” he
murmured. “Let me see you.”
“Gideon …”
He waited patiently and I
knew that patience would
hold. Whether it took me five
minutes or five hours, he
would wait for me. And that
was why I trusted him.
Because it was never a
question of whether I would
submit, but when I was ready
to, and that was a decision he
most often left to me.
I widened my stance and
tried to slow the quickness of
my breathing. Reaching down
with both hands, I touched
the lips of my sex and spread
them, exposing my clit to the
man it ached for.
Gideon straightened
slowly. “You have such a
pretty cunt, Eva.”
As he leaned closer, I held
my breath. His hands lifted
from his thighs, reaching for
mine to hold me steady.
“Don’t move,” he ordered.
Then he licked me in a
leisurely glide.
“Oh God,” I moaned, my
legs shaking.
“Sit down,” he said
hoarsely, sliding to his knees
on the floor as I obeyed.
The glass was cool against
my bare buttocks, a sharp
contrast to the heat of my
skin. My arms stretched back,
gripping the far edge of the
table for balance as he
pressed my thighs wide with
his palms, splaying me open.
His breath was hot against
my damp flesh, his focus
fully on my sex. “You could
be wetter.”
I watched, panting, as he
lowered his head and
wrapped his lips around my
clit. The heat was searing, the
lash of his tongue
devastating. I cried out,
wanting to writhe but held
fast by his grip. My head fell
back, my ears ringing with
the rush of blood and the
sound of Gideon’s groan. His
tongue fluttered over the tight
bundle of nerves, driving me
relentlessly toward orgasm.
My stomach tightened as the
pleasure built, the soft silk of
his hair brushing along my
sensitive inner thighs.
A low moan escaped me.
“I’m going to come,” I
gasped. “Gideon … God …
I’m going to come.”
He drove his tongue inside
me. My elbows weakened,
dropping me lower. His
tongue fucked into the
clutching opening of my sex,
stroking through the sensitive
tissues, teasing me with a
promise of the penetration I
truly craved.
“Fuck me,” I begged.
Gideon pulled back,
licking his lips. “Not here.”
I made a sound of protest
as he stood, so close to
orgasm I could taste it. He
held his hand out to me,
helped me straighten and then
stand. When I wobbled, he
caught me up, tossing me
over his shoulder.
“Gideon!”
But then his hand was
between my legs, massaging
my wet, swollen sex, and I
didn’t care how he carried
me, as long as he got me
someplace where he’d take
me.
We reached the hallway
and turned, then stopped too
quickly to have reached his
bedroom. I heard the
doorknob turn and then the
light flicked on.
We were in the bedroom
that was mine. He set me
down on my feet, facing him.
“Why here?” I asked.
Maybe some men would head
to the nearest bed, but Gideon
had more control than that. If
he wanted me in the second
bedroom, he had a reason for
it.
“Turn around,” he said
quietly.
Something about his voice
… the way he looked at me
…
I looked over my shoulder.
And saw the swing.
IT wasn’t what I expected.
I’d looked up sex swings
on the Internet when Gideon
had first mentioned one.
What I’d found were rickety
things you hung from door
frames, not-so-rickety things
that hung from four-legged
frames, and ones that hung
from an eyebolt in the ceiling.
All of them consisted of some
combination of chains and/or
straps that acted as slings for
various body parts. Pictures
of women actually harnessed
in the damn things looked
uncomfortable.
Honestly, I couldn’t see
how anyone could get past
the awkwardness and fear of
collapse, let alone manage an
orgasm.
I should’ve known Gideon
would have something else in
mind.
Turning, I faced the swing
head-on. Gideon had cleared
out the bedroom at some
point. The bed and
furnishings were gone. The
only object in the room was
the swing itself, suspended
from a sturdy cagelike
structure. A wide, solid metal
platform anchored steel sides
and roof, which supported the
weight of a padded metal
chair and chains. Red leather
cuffs for wrists and ankles
hung in the appropriate
places.
His arms wrapped around
me from behind, one hand
sliding up beneath my shirt to
cup my breast, while the
other slid between my legs to
push two fingers inside me.
Nuzzling my hair out of the
way, he kissed my throat.
“How do you feel, looking at
that?”
I thought about it.
“Intrigued. A little
apprehensive.”
His lips curved against my
skin. “Let’s see how you feel
once you’re in it.”
A shiver of expectation and
apprehension moved through
me. I could see from the
position of the cuffs that I
would be helpless, unable to
move or pull away. Unable to
exert any control whatsoever
over what might happen to
me.
“I want to do this right,
Eva. Not like that night in the
elevator. I want you to feel it
when I’m in control and
we’re in it together.”
My head fell back against
him. Somehow, it was harder
giving the consent he wanted.
There was less …
responsibility when he just
took charge.
But that was a cop-out.
“What’s your safe word,
angel?” he murmured, his
teeth scoring gently across
my throat. His hands were
magic, his fingers gliding
shallowly inside me.
“Crossfire.”
“You say the word and
everything stops. Say it
again.”
“Crossfire.”
His dexterous fingers
tugged at my nipple, milking
it expertly. “There’s nothing
to be afraid of. You just have
to sit back and take my cock.
I’m going to make you come
without you having to do a
thing.”
I took a deep breath. “I feel
like that’s always how it is
between us.”
“Try it this way,” he
coaxed, his hands moving to
pull my shirt off. “If you
don’t like it, we’ll hit the bed
instead.”
For a moment, I wanted to
delay, take more time to let it
all settle in. I’d promised the
swing, but he wasn’t holding
that over me …
“Crossfire,” he breathed,
hugging me from behind.
I didn’t know if he was
reminding me of my safe
word or telling me he loved
me so much there were no
words for how he felt. Either
way, the effect on me was the
same. I felt safe.
I also felt his excitement.
His breathing had quickened
the moment I’d spotted the
swing. His erection was like
steel against my buttocks and
his skin was hot against mine.
His desire spurred my own,
made me want to do whatever
it took to give him as much
pleasure as he could stand.
If he needed something, I
wanted to be the woman who
gave it to him. He gave so
much to me. Everything.
“Okay,” I said softly.
“Okay.”
He kissed my shoulder,
then stepped beside me,
taking my hand in his.
I followed him to the
swing, studying it intently.
The narrow seat hung at waist
level for Gideon, which
meant he had to turn me to
face him, then lift me up into
the chair. His mouth touched
mine as my bare ass touched
the cool leather, his tongue
teasing the seam of my lips. I
shivered. Whether that was
from the chill, his kiss, or
anxiety, I didn’t know.
Gideon pulled away, his
gaze heavy-lidded and hot.
He eased me into position,
holding the chains steady as I
leaned into the seat back,
which was angled away from
him, making me want to
stretch my legs out for
balance.
“You settled?” he asked,
watching me intently.
I knew the question was
about more than my physical
comfort. I nodded.
He stepped back, his gaze
never leaving my face. “I’m
going to secure your ankles.
You tell me if anything
doesn’t feel right.”
“All right.” My voice was
breathy, my pulse racing.
His hand slid down my leg,
the stroke warm and
provocative. I couldn’t look
away as he wrapped the
crimson leather around my
ankle and cinched the metal
buckle. The cuff was fit
securely but not too tightly.
Gideon moved quickly and
confidently. A moment later,
my other leg was suspended
as well.
He looked at me. “Okay so
far?”
“You’ve done this before.”
I pouted. His actions seemed
too practiced to be those of a
beginner.
He didn’t answer. Instead
he began to strip as slowly
and methodically as he’d
restrained me.
Mesmerized, I greedily
drank in every inch of skin he
revealed. My husband had
such an amazing body. He
was so hard and tight, so
virile. It was impossible not
to become aroused seeing
him naked.
His tongue slid along the
bottom curve of his mouth in
a leisurely, erotic caress.
“Still good, angel?”
Gideon knew exactly what
the sight of him did to me,
and it turned me on even
more that he was arrogant
enough to use that weakness
against me. God knew I did
the same to him when I could.
“You are so fucking hot,” I
told him, licking my own lips.
He smiled and came
toward me, his thick, long
cock curving upward to his
navel. “I think you’ll really
enjoy this.”
I didn’t have to ask why he
said so, because it was
evident as he reached me and
took my hands in his. My
vantage of him from the
swing seat was completely
unhindered. From the thighs
upward, he was totally
exposed between the spread
of my legs.
He bent and kissed me
again. Softly. Sweetly. I
moaned at the unexpected
tenderness and the lushness
of his flavor.
Releasing one of my hands,
he reached between us,
gripping his cock and angling
it downward to stroke
between the lips of my sex.
The wide head slid through
the slickness of my desire,
then nudged against my
exposed clit. Pleasure rippled
through me and I discovered
just how vulnerable I was. I
couldn’t arch my hips. I
couldn’t tighten my inner
muscles to chase the
sensation.
A low whimper escaped
me. I needed more, but could
only wait for him to give it to
me.
“You trust me,” he
whispered against my mouth.
It wasn’t a question, but I
answered anyway. “Yes.”
Gideon nodded. “Grab the
chains.”
There were wrist restraints
above my head. I wondered
why he didn’t use them, but I
trusted him to know best. If
he didn’t think I was ready, it
was because he knew me so
well. In some ways, he knew
me better than I knew myself.
The love I felt for him
unfurled in my chest until it
filled me, pushing aside the
vestiges of fear that hovered
in the dark corners of my
mind. I’d never felt so close
to him, never known it was
possible to believe in
someone so completely.
I did as Gideon ordered
and gripped the chains. He
stepped close again, his abs
glistening with the first mist
of perspiration. I could see
his pulse throbbing in his
neck, his arms, his penis. His
heart was racing like mine.
The head of his cock was as
wet with excitement as my
sex. The hunger between us
was a living thing in the
room, sliding sinuously
around us, narrowing the
world to just the two of us.
“Don’t let go,” he ordered,
waiting until I nodded my
agreement before he
proceeded.
He gripped a chain where it
met with the seat. His other
hand guided his cock to my
cleft. The thick crown pressed
teasingly against me, taunting
me with the promise of
pleasure. I was panting as I
waited for him to take the
step forward that would slide
him into me, my core aching
with the need to be filled.
Instead, he gripped the seat
of the chair in both hands and
pulled me onto his cock.
The sound that ripped from
my throat was inhuman, the
savagely erotic feeling of
being so deeply penetrated
driving me wild. He sank
deep in that one easy glide,
my body unable to offer any
resistance.
Gideon snarled, a tremor
running through his powerful
body. “Fuck,” he hissed.
“Your cunt is so good.”
I started to reach for him,
but he pushed the swing back,
gliding me off his rock-hard
erection. The feeling of being
emptied made me moan in
distress.
“Please,” I begged softly.
“I told you not to let go,”
he said, with a wicked gleam
in his eyes.
“I won’t,” I promised,
gripping the chains so hard it
hurt.
His arms flexed as he
pulled me back, sliding me
onto his cock. My toes curled.
The feeling of
weightlessness, of total
surrender, was indescribable.
“Talk to me,” he bit out.
“Tell me you like this.”
“Damn it,” I gasped,
feeling sweat slide down my
nape. “Don’t stop.”
One moment I was held
stationary, the next I was
swinging fluidly, my sex
sliding on and off Gideon’s
rigid cock with breathtaking
speed. His body worked like
a well-oiled machine, his
arms, chest, abs, and thighs
straining with the exertion of
masterfully handling the
swing. The sight of his
powerful movements, the
intensity of his focus on
pleasuring us both, the feel of
him pumping so deep and fast
into me …
I orgasmed with a scream,
unable to contain the rush that
surged through me. He
fucked me through it,
growling roughly, his face
flushed and etched with lust.
I’d never come so hard, so
fast. I couldn’t see or breathe
for an endless moment, my
body wracked by a pleasure
more ferocious than any I’d
ever felt before.
The swing slowed, then
stopped. Gideon took an extra
step toward me that kept him
buried inside me. He smelled
decadent, primal. Pure sin
and sex.
His hands cupped my face.
His fingers brushed tendrils
of hair off my damp cheeks.
My sex spasmed around him,
all too aware of how hard and
thick he still was.
“You didn’t come,” I
accused, feeling far too
vulnerable after the insanity
of my orgasm.
Gideon took my mouth in a
harsh, demanding kiss. “I’m
going to restrain your wrists.
Then I’m going to come in
you.”
My nipples tightened into
painful points. “Oh God.”
“You trust me,” he said
again, his gaze searching my
face.
I touched him while I still
could, my hands sliding over
his sweat-slick chest, feeling
the desperate beat of his
heart. “More than anything.”

19
“GOOD MORNING, ACE.”
I looked over my shoulder
at the sound of Eva’s voice,
smiling as I watched her
circle the island on her way to
the coffeemaker. Her hair was
a wild tangle, her legs sexy
beneath the hem of the T-shirt
she wore.
Returning my attention to
the stove and the French toast
I was browning in the pan, I
asked, “How are you
feeling?”
“Umm …”
I looked at her again and
found her blushing.
“I’m sore,” she said,
inserting a coffee pod into the
machine. “Deep inside.”
I grinned. The swing had
positioned her perfectly,
allowing for optimal
penetration. I’d never been as
deep in her before. I had been
thinking about it all morning
and decided that I would be
speaking to Ash about his
plans for the renovations. One
of the bedrooms would need
to have two closets—one for
clothes, the other for the
swing.
“Jeez,” she muttered,
“Look at that cocky smirk.
Men are pigs.”
“And here I am, slaving
over a hot stove for you.”
“Yeah, yeah.” She swatted
my ass as she passed me with
a steaming cup of coffee in
hand.
I caught her by the waist
before she got too far, giving
her a quick hard kiss on the
cheek. “You were amazing
last night.”
I’d felt something click
into place between us so
strongly that the change had
been as tangible as the rings I
wore on my fingers, and I
cherished it as dearly.
She flashed me a dazzling
smile, then opened the fridge
to pull out the carton of halfand-
half. While she took care
of that, I plated the finished
French toast.
“I’ve been wanting to talk
to you about something,” she
said, joining me at the island
and wriggling onto a bar
stool.
My brows lifted. “Okay.”
“I’d like to become
involved with the Crossroads
Foundation—financially and
administratively.”
“That could encompass a
lot of things, angel. Tell me
what you have in mind.”
Shrugging, she picked up
her fork. “I’ve been thinking
about the settlement money I
got from Nathan’s dad. It’s
just sitting in the bank, and
after what Megumi has been
through … I’ve realized that I
need to put that money to
work and I don’t want to
wait. I’d like to help fund the
programs offered by
Crossroads and help
brainstorm ways to expand
them.”
I smiled inwardly, pleased
to see her moving in the right
direction. “All right. We’ll
work something out.”
“Yeah?” She brightened
like the sun, the shining light
in my world.
“Of course. I’d like to
commit more time to it, too.”
“We can work together!”
She bounced up and down.
“I’m excited about this,
Gideon.”
I let the smile show. “I can
tell.”
“It just feels like a natural
progression for us. An
extension of us, really.” She
cut into her food and forked a
bite to her mouth. She
hummed her appreciation.
“Yummy,” she mumbled.
“I’m glad you like it.”
“You’re hot and you can
cook. I’m a lucky girl.”
I decided not to tell her I’d
just downloaded the recipe
that morning. Instead, I
considered what she’d said.
Had I made a tactical error
by moving too quickly with
Mark? It was possible that if
I’d left it alone just a little
longer, Eva might have come
around to working at Cross
Industries on her own.
But did I have the luxury
of giving her more time with
Landon closing in? Even
now, I didn’t think so.
Seeking to mitigate any
possible fallout, I debated the
merits of broaching the topic
of Mark’s move to Cross
Industries now versus later.
Eva had opened the door by
talking about us working
together. If I didn’t walk
through it, I ran the risk of
her finding out another way.
I had taken that chance on
Saturday, knowing Eva and
Mark were friends who talked
outside work. He could’ve
called her at any time, but I’d
banked on him thinking it
over first, discussing it with
his partner, and coming to
peace with leaving Waters
Field & Leaman.
“I have to talk to you about
something, too, angel.”
“I’m all ears.”
Shooting for nonchalance,
I grabbed the maple syrup
and poured some onto my
plate. “I offered Mark Garrity
a job.”
There was a moment of
stunned silence, and then,
“You did what?”
The tone of her voice
confirmed that I’d been right
to be up front sooner rather
than later. I looked at her. She
was staring at me.
“I’ve asked Mark to work
for Cross Industries,” I
repeated.
Her face paled. “When?”
“Friday.”
“Friday,” she parroted.
“It’s Sunday. You’re just
bringing this up now?”
Since the question was
rhetorical, I didn’t reply,
choosing to wait for a clearer
assessment of the situation
before possibly making things
worse.
“Why, Gideon?”
I took the same tack I’d
used with Mark—I told the
parts of the truth most likely
to be accepted. “He’s a solid
employee. He’ll bring a lot to
the team.”
“Bullshit.” The color came
back into her face in an angry
rush. “Don’t patronize me.
You’re putting me out of a
job and you didn’t think that
was something you should
discuss with me first?”
I switched tactics.
“LanCorp asked for Mark
directly, didn’t they?”
She was silent a minute.
“That’s what this is about?
The PhazeOne system? Are
you fucking serious?”
I’d wondered what product
Ryan Landon would use as an
excuse to approach Eva. I
was surprised he’d gone with
a product so vital to his
bottom line, then chastised
myself for not expecting it.
“You didn’t answer my
question, Eva.”
“What the hell does it
matter?” she snapped. “Yeah,
they asked for Mark. So
what? You don’t want your
competitors using him? Are
you trying to say this was a
business decision?”
“No, this was personal.” I
set my utensils down. “Eric
Landon, Ryan Landon’s
father, invested heavily with
my dad and lost everything.
Ryan Landon has been
gunning for me ever since.”
A frown marred the space
between her brows. “So you
didn’t want us working on
any campaigns for him? Is
that what you’re saying?”
“I’m saying that Ryan
Landon asked for Mark as a
way to get to you.”
“What? Why?” Irritation
mixed with anger on her face.
“He’s married, for chrissakes.
He brought his wife to lunch
with us the other day. You’ve
got no reason to be jealous.”
“He wouldn’t be interested
in you that way,” I agreed.
“It’s more of a triumph to
have you working for him.
He wants the satisfaction of
knowing he can give an order
and you’ll have to jump to get
it done.”
“That’s ridiculous.”
“You don’t know the
whole of it, Eva. How many
years he’s spent trying to
undercut me in every way
possible. Every business
decision he makes is driven
by the need to rewrite the
connection between the
Landon and Cross names.
Every success he’s had has
been accompanied by a
mention of his father’s failure
to see my dad as a fraud and
what that cost the Landons.”
“Of course I don’t know,”
she said coldly. “Because you
didn’t see fit to tell me.”
“I’m telling you now.”
“When it doesn’t matter
anymore!” She slid off the
bar stool and stalked out of
the kitchen.
I went after her, as I always
did. “Eva.”
I caught her by the elbow,
but she yanked free, spinning
to face me.
“Don’t touch me!”
“Don’t walk away from
me,” I growled. “If we’re
going to fight, let’s get it over
with.”
“That’s what you were
counting on, right? You
figured you’d do whatever
you wanted, then sweet-talk
or fuck your way through it
later. But you can’t fix this,
Gideon. You can’t say a few
words or screw me brainless
and get away with it this
time.”
“Fix what? I saw someone
maneuvering to take
advantage of you and I took
care of it.”
“Is that how you see it?”
Her hands went to her hips. “I
don’t see it that way at all.
Landon is taking the risk.
What if Mark and I do a
crappy job? He’s got a lot
riding on PhazeOne.”
“Exactly. He has in-house
advertising, marketing, and
promotion, just like I do.
Why take something he’s
sunk a fortune into—even by
my standards—and set
himself up for leaks or a
massive fail?”
She threw her hands up
with a snort.
“Right,” I bit out. “You
can’t answer that because
there is no good answer. It’s
an unnecessary gamble. The
only people handling the
launch of the next-generation
GenTen are people whose
souls I own.”
“What are you saying?”
“That Landon’s waited a
long time for his pound of
Cross flesh. Maybe he
doesn’t care that you married
into the name. I don’t know
what he has in mind. At the
very least, he’s forcing us
into a place where we’re
unable to share information
with each other.”
Her brow arched. “How is
that any different from how
our relationship usually
works?”
“Don’t.” I clenched my
hands at my sides, frustrated
by her stubbornness. “Don’t
make this about us when it’s
about him. I’ll be damned if
Landon drags you through
hell because of me.”
“I’m not saying you’re
wrong! If you’d told me
about this, I would’ve made
the right decision on my own.
Instead, you forced me out of
a job I love!”
“Back up. What decision
would that have been?”
“I don’t know.” She gave
me a cold, hard smile that
chilled my blood. “And now
we’ll never find out.”
She turned her back to me
again.
“Stop.”
“No,” she tossed over her
shoulder. “I’m getting
dressed. Then I’m leaving.”
“Like hell.” I followed her
into the bedroom.
“I can’t be around you
right now, Gideon. I don’t
even want to look at you.”
My mind raced, searching
for something to say that
would calm her down. “Mark
hasn’t taken the job.”
She shook her head and
yanked open a drawer to pull
out a pair of shorts. “He will.
I’m sure you made him an
offer he can’t refuse.”
“I’ll withdraw it.” God. I
was backpedaling and it
rankled, but she was so angry
I couldn’t reach her. She was
as distant as I’d ever seen her.
Remote and untouchable.
After the wildly erotic night
we’d had, when we had been
as close as ever, her attitude
was unbearable.
“Don’t bother, Gideon. The
damage is done. But you’ll
get a solid employee who’ll
bring a lot to your team.” She
tugged the shorts on and went
into the closet.
I was right behind her,
blocking the doorway while
she shoved her feet into flipflops.
“Listen to me, damn it.
They’re coming after you.
Everyone. They want to get at
me through you. I’m doing
the best I can, Eva. I’m trying
to protect us the only way I
know how.”
She paused, facing me.
“That’s a problem. Because
this way doesn’t work for me.
It will never work for me.”
“Goddamn it, I’m trying!”
“All you had to do was talk
to me, Gideon. I was halfway
there on my own. Working
with you on Crossroads was
just the first step. I was going
to make the decision to work
with you, and you took that
away from me. You took it
away from both of us. And
we’ll never get it back.”
The icy finality in her tone
made me crazed. I could deal
when discussions went
sideways. I could spin and
switch strategy on the fly.
What I couldn’t handle was
when my grip on Eva slipped.
When we’d said our vows, I
had made the irrevocable
decision to let everything go
—my ambition, my pride, my
heart—to hang on to her. If I
couldn’t do that, I had
nothing.
“Don’t throw that at me
now, angel,” I warned.
“Every time I’ve brought up
working together you shut me
down.”
“So you just bulldoze right
through me?”
“I was willing to give you
time! I had a plan. I was
going to seduce you with the
possibilities, let you decide
that the best way to develop
your potential was alongside
me.”
“You should’ve stuck with
the plan. Get out of my way.”
I held my ground. “How
could I stick with any plan
the last few weeks? While
you’re feeling righteous,
think about what I’ve dealt
with. Brett, the damned tape
of you with him, Chris, my
brother, therapy, Ireland, my
mother, Anne, Corinne,
fucking Landon—”
Eva crossed her arms.
“Gotta handle it all yourself,
don’t you? Am I really your
wife, Gideon? I’m not even
your friend. I bet Angus and
Raúl know more about your
life than I do. Arash, too. I’m
just the pretty cunt you fuck.”
“Shut up.”
“You need to get out of my
way before this gets any
uglier.”
“I can’t let you leave. You
know I can’t. Not like this.”
Her jaw tightened. “You’re
asking me to give you
something I don’t have right
now. I’m hollowed out,
Gideon.”
“Angel …” I reached for
her, my chest so tight I found
it hard to breathe. The
devastation on her face was
killing me. I’d destroy anyone
who put that look on her face,
but this time, I had done it.
“What does it matter if you
would’ve made the same
decision anyway?”
“You need to stop talking,”
she said hoarsely. “Because
every word coming out of
your mouth makes me think
we’re so far apart on this that
we’ve got no business being
married.”
If she’d stabbed me in the
chest, it couldn’t have hurt
worse. The air in the closet
became hot and stale, drying
my throat and making my
eyes burn. The floor seemed
to tilt beneath my feet, the
foundation of my life shifting
as Eva slipped further and
further away.
“Tell me what to do,” I
whispered.
Her eyes glistened. “Let
me go for now. Give me
some space to think. A few
days—”
“No. No!” Panic swelled
until I was forced to grip the
door frame to stay upright.
“Maybe a few weeks. I
need to find a new job, after
all.”
“I can’t,” I gasped, panting
for air. A black ring
encroached on my vision,
until Eva was the lone
pinpoint of light. “For God’s
sake, something else, Eva!”
“I have to figure out what
to do now.” She rubbed at her
forehead with rough fingers.
“And I can’t think when
you’re looking at me like
that. I can’t think …”
She moved to pass me and
I grabbed her by the arms,
kissing her, groaning when I
felt her soften for an instant. I
tasted her, tasted her tears. Or
maybe they were mine.
Her hands went to my hair,
fisting it, pulling it hard. She
turned her head, breaking the
seal of my mouth.
“Crossfire,” she sobbed,
the word cracking like a
gunshot.
I released her abruptly,
stumbling back, even as my
mind screamed at me to hang
on.
I let her go, and she left
me.
THE sea breeze blows through
my hair and I close my eyes,
absorbing the feel as it buffets
me. The rhythmic push and
pull of the waves against the
beach and the raucous cries
of seagulls anchor me in the
moment, in this place.
It’s home in a way I
haven’t known for a long
time, although I’ve spent less
than a handful of days here. It
is a place I’ve shared only
with Eva, so all of my
memories of here are as
drenched with her as the sand
is with rays of the sun. Like
the sand, I’ve been crushed
down into fine, tiny bits by the
forces around me. And like
the sun, Eva has brought joy
and warmth to my existence.
She joins me on the deck,
standing behind me at the
railing. I feel her hand on my
shoulder, then the press of
her cheek against my bare
back.
“Angel,” I murmur, and
place my hand over hers.
This is what we needed, to
come back to this place. It’s
our retreat when the world
closes in on us, trying to
separate us. We heal each
other here.
Relief washes through me.
She’s back. We’re together.
She understands now why I
did what I did. She was so
angry, so hurt. For a moment,
I had felt crippling fear that
I’d destroyed the most
precious part of my life.
“Gideon,” she breathes, in
that husky siren’s voice. One
arm slides around my waist to
hold me from behind.
I tilt my head back and let
the power of her love pour
through me. Her fingers glide
over my hip, and then she’s
holding my cock in her hand.
Stroking it from root to tip. I
harden and thicken, ready for
her. I live to serve her, to
please her. How could she
have doubted it?
A moan rumbles up from
the very depths of my soul,
the desire I always feel for
her climbing through me.
Pre-cum leaks from the
swollen head of my dick, my
balls growing heavy and full.
Her hand on my shoulder
glides down my back,
pressing lightly, urging me to
bend forward.
I obey because I want her
to see how she owns me. I
want her to understand that I
would do anything, give
anything, to make her safe
and happy.
Her hand traces my spine,
kneading lightly. I grip the
wooden handrail that circles
the deck and spread my legs
at her urging.
Now, both of her hands are
between my thighs, her breath
hot and panting against my
back. She’s pumping my cock
with a firm, practiced grip.
Harder than I’m used to from
her. Demanding. Her other
hand is massaging my sac,
driving the urgency into me.
Her grip slickens as the
pre-cum streams steadily
from the slit at the tip of my
dick. The salty air washes
over me, cooling the sweat
misting my skin.
“Eva …” I gasp her name,
so hard for her, so
desperately in love.
Her fingers, now creamy
and always cleverly agile,
slide back and tease the dark
rosette of my anus. It feels
good, even though I don’t
want it to. The stroking of my
penis is making it hard to
breathe, to think, to fight …
“That’s it,” she coaxes.
I try to arch away, but
she’s got me trapped with my
dick in her hand.
“Don’t,” I tell her,
squirming.
“You like it,” she purrs,
working my cock, her touch
something I crave and can’t
resist. “Show me how much
you want me.”
She pushes two slick
fingers inside my ass. I cry
out, writhing away, but she’s
rubbing and thrusting into
me, hitting the spot that
makes me want to come more
than anything. The pleasure
grows despite the tears
burning my eyes.
My head falls forward. My
chin touches my heaving
chest. It’s coming. I’m
coming. I can’t stop it. Not
with her …
The fingers inside me
thicken, lengthen. The
thrusting becomes frenzied,
the slap of flesh against flesh
drowning out the sounds of
the ocean. I hear a rough,
lusty growl but it’s not mine.
A cock is in me, fucking me. It
hurts and yet the pain is
tinged with a sick, unwanted
pleasure.
“Keep stroking it,” he
pants. “You’re almost there.”
Agony explodes in my
chest. Eva isn’t here. She’s
gone. She’s left me.
Vomit rises into my throat.
I throw him off violently,
hearing him crash through
the sliding door behind us,
the glass shattering. Hugh
laughs hysterically and I
round on him, finding him
sprawled amid the glistening
slivers, his hair as red as his
blood, his eyes lit with that
vile lustful avarice.
“You think she’d want
you?” he taunts, clambering
to his feet. “You told her
everything. Who’d want you
after that?”
“Fuck you!” I lunge and
tackle him back down. My fist
pounds into his face again
and again.
The shards of glass pierce
me, cut into me, but the pain
is nothing next to what I feel
inside.
Eva is gone. I’d known she
would leave, that I couldn’t
keep her. I’d known it, but I
had hoped. I couldn’t fight
the hope.
Hugh won’t stop laughing.
I feel his nose shatter. His
cheekbone, his jaw. His
laughter turns to gurgles, but
it’s still laughter.
My arm pulls back to hit
him again—
Anne is lying beneath me,
her face battered nearly
beyond recognition. Horrified
at what I’ve done, I jerk
away, scrambling to my feet.
The glass digs deep into the
soles of my feet.
Anne laughs as bubbling
blood pours from her nose
and mouth, spreading
through the home that was
once a sanctuary. Staining
everything, the taint washing
away the sun until only a
blood moon remains …
I woke up with a scream in
my throat. Sweat drenched
my hair and skin. Darkness
suffocated me.
Scrubbing at my eyes, I
rolled onto my hands and
knees, sobbing. I crawled
toward the only light I could
see, the weak silver glow that
was my only guide.
The bedroom. God. I
collapsed on the floor, racked
by tears. I’d fallen asleep in
the closet, unable to move
after Eva left me, afraid to
take one literal step in any
direction toward a life
without her in it.
The face of the clock
glowed brightly in the
darkened room.
It was one A.M.
A new day. And Eva was
still gone.
“YOU’RE here early.”
Scott’s cheery voice lured
my gaze from the photo of
Eva on my desk.
“Good morning,” I greeted
him, feeling as if I were still
in a nightmare.
I’d come to work shortly
after three A.M., unable to
sleep anymore and unable to
go to Eva. I wanted to, would
have—nothing could keep me
away from her—but when I
tracked her phone I found her
at Stanton’s penthouse, a
place I couldn’t reach. The
anguish of that, knowing she
was deliberately keeping
herself from me, ate at me
from the inside out like acid.
I couldn’t stay home and
go through the morning
routine of preparing for work
without Eva. It had been
easier to revert to the
schedule I’d often kept before
her, coming into work while
the moon was high, finding
peace in the place where I
exercised complete control.
But today there was no
peace. Only the torment of
knowing that she was in the
same building I was by now,
so damn close and yet farther
away than she’d ever been.
“Mark Garrity was waiting
by reception when I came in,”
Scott continued. “He said
you’d discussed having him
come in today … ?”
My gut knotted. “I’ll see
him.”
I pushed back from my
desk and stood. I’d thought of
nothing but Eva and the offer
I had made to Mark, trying to
reason out how I could have
done anything differently. I
knew Eva too well. Telling
her about Ryan Landon
wouldn’t have made her leave
Waters Field & Leaman any
more than telling her about
Anne would cause her to be
more cautious.
Eva would face them headon
instead, growling like a
lioness to defend me and
failing to see the danger to
herself. It was her way and I
loved her for it, but I would
also protect her when the
situation called for it.
“Mark.” I extended my
hand as he entered, knowing
immediately that he was
going to say yes. Energy
radiated off him and his dark
eyes were lit with
anticipation.
We agreed that he would
begin in October, giving
Waters Field & Leaman
nearly a month’s notice. He
wanted to bring Eva along
with him and I encouraged
him to make the offer, even
as I doubted that she would
accept it. He countered some
of my terms and I negotiated
by instinct, keeping him in
check without my heart being
in it.
In the end, he left happy
and pleased with his changed
situation. I was left with the
deepening fear that Eva
would not forgive me.
MONDAY blurred into
Tuesday. There were only
three times a day when I felt
any life at all—at nine when I
knew Eva arrived for work, at
lunch, and again at five when
she finished for the day. I
waited with endless hope for
her to reach out to me. To call
or communicate in any way.
Another horrible fight would
be better than the aching
silence.
She didn’t. I could only
watch her on the security
monitors, devouring the sight
of her coming and going like
a man dying of hunger,
scared to approach her and
risk widening the chasm
between us.
I stayed in the office
overnight, afraid to go home.
Afraid of what I would do if I
entered any of the residences
I shared with her. Even my
office was a torment, the
couch where I had fucked her
an inescapable reminder of
what I’d had only days
before. I showered in my
office’s washroom and
changed into one of the many
suits I kept at work.
I’d never thought it strange
to live for work before. Now,
I was overwhelmed by
emotion I couldn’t express,
comprehending just how
much of my life Eva had
come to fill.
She stayed at Stanton’s
again. It didn’t escape my
notice that she preferred to
spend time with her mother
than to risk having to deal
with me.
I texted her constantly.
Pleas for her to call me. I just
need to hear your voice.
Notes about nothing. Cooler
today, isn’t it? Comments
about work. Never realized
Scott always wears blue. And
most of all, I love you. For
some reason, it was easier to
type those three words than to
say them. I typed them a lot.
Over and over again. I didn’t
want her to forget that.
Whatever my faults and fuckups,
everything I did or
thought or felt was love for
her. Sometimes I got mad,
hating what she was doing to
me. To us. Goddamn you!
Call me. Stop doing this to
me!
“You look like shit,” Arash
said, eyeing me as I reviewed
the contracts he’d placed on
my desk. “You getting sick
again?”
“I’m fine.”
“My man, you are anything
but fine.”
I glared at him, shutting
him up.
IT was nearly six and I was on
my way to Dr. Petersen’s
office when Eva finally
reached out to me.
I love you, too.
The words wavered as my
eyes stung. I typed back with
shaking fingers, nearly dizzy
with relief. I miss you so much.
Can’t we talk, please? I need to see
you.
She didn’t reply before I
reached Dr. Petersen’s, which
blackened my mood to the
point of violence. She was
punishing me in the worst
possible way. I was as jittery
as a junkie, desperate for a hit
of her to function. To think.
“Gideon.” Dr. Petersen
greeted me at the door to his
office with a smile that
quickly faded when he saw
me. Concern drew his brows
down. “You don’t look well.”
“I’m not,” I snapped.
He calmly gestured for me
to take a seat. I remained
standing, roiling inside,
debating leaving and
searching for my wife. I
couldn’t stand around and
wait anymore. It was too
much to ask of me.
“Maybe we should walk
again,” he said. “I could stand
to stretch my legs.”
“Call Eva,” I ordered. “Tell
her to come here. She’ll listen
to you.”
He blinked at me. “You’re
having trouble with Eva.”
Shrugging out of my suit
jacket, I threw it on the
couch. “She’s being
irrational! She won’t see me
… won’t talk to me. How the
fuck are we supposed to work
things out if we’re not even
talking?”
“That’s a reasonable
question.”
“Damn right! I’m a
reasonable man. She,
however, is out of her damn
mind. She can’t keep doing
this. You have to get her here.
You have to make her talk to
me.”
“All right. But first I need
to understand what’s
happened.” He sat in his
chair. “I’m not going to be
much use to you if I don’t
know what’s going on.”
I pointed a finger at him.
“Don’t play your head games
with me, Doc. Not today.”
“I think I’m being as
reasonable as you are,” he
said smoothly. “I want you to
work things out with Eva,
too. I think you know that.”
Exhaling in a rush, I sank
onto the edge of the sofa, then
dropped my head into my
hands. It was throbbing
viciously, pounding front and
back.
“You’re fighting with
Eva,” he said.
“Yes.”
“When’s the last time you
spoke with her?”
I swallowed hard.
“Sunday.”
“What happened on
Sunday?”
I told him. It came out in a
rush that had him scribbling
frantically on his tablet. The
words spewed out in an angry
purge, leaving me feeling
wiped out and exhausted.
He continued to write for a
few moments after I finished,
and then his gaze lifted to my
face. I saw compassion and it
tightened my throat.
“You cost Eva her job,” he
pointed out, “a job she’s told
us both that she enjoys very
much. You can see why she’d
be upset with you, can’t
you?”
“Yeah, I get it. But I had
valid reasons. Reasons she
understands. That’s what I
don’t get. She understands
and she’s still cutting me
off.”
“I’m not sure I understand
why you didn’t discuss this
with Eva beforehand. Can
you explain that to me?”
I rubbed at the back of my
neck, where the tension felt
like steel cables. “She
would’ve stewed over it,” I
muttered. “It would’ve taken
her time to come around. In
the meantime, I’m trying to
manage a ton of other shit.
We’re getting hit from all
sides.”
“I saw the news about
Corinne Giroux’s book about
you.”
“Oh, yeah.” My mouth
curved grimly. “She probably
got the idea from Six-Ninth’s
‘Golden’ video. Landon got
to Eva through a hole in my
guard. I couldn’t risk giving
him another opening while I
was distracted with
everything else Eva and I are
dealing with right now.”
Dr. Petersen nodded.
“You’re facing a lot of
pressure. Don’t you trust Eva
to help you reach the
decisions you’re making?
You have to know that her
conflicts with her mother
often stem from not being
consulted before actions are
taken.”
“I know that.” I tried to
articulate my chaotic
thoughts. “But I need to take
care of her. After what she’s
lived through …”
My eyes squeezed shut.
Knowing what she’d suffered
was almost too much for me
to think about sometimes. “I
have to be strong for her.
Make the tough calls.”
“Gideon, you’re one of the
strongest men I know,” he
said quietly.
I opened my eyes and
looked at him. “You haven’t
seen me the way she has.”
Crying like a child.
Brutalized by memories.
Masturbating while
unconscious. Violent in my
sleep. Weak, so weak.
Helpless.
“Do you think she doubts
you because you’ve let her
see you vulnerable? That
doesn’t sound like Eva to
me.”
My eyes stung. “You don’t
know everything. You just …
You don’t know.”
“But Eva does. And she
married you anyway. She
loves you—very much—
anyway.” He offered a kind
smile that somehow slashed
like a blade, cutting me open.
“You asked me once if
relationships were about
compromise. Do you
remember that?”
I jerked a nod.
“That compromise means
you don’t always have to be
the strong one, Gideon. You
can do the heavy lifting on
occasion, and you can let Eva
do it sometimes. Marriage
isn’t about whether you’re
strong enough as an
individual. It’s about how
strong you are together and
the luxury of taking turns
carrying the load.”
“I …” My head bowed
again. Eva had said the same
thing. “I’m trying. I swear to
God, I’m trying.”
“I know you are.”
“She has to take me back.
She has to come back. I need
her. She’s killing me right
now. She’s ripping me apart.”
I stared at my hands, at the
rings she’d given me that
made me hers. “What do I
do? Tell me what to do.”
“Eva is going to want to
know that you’re willing to
change. She’ll want to see
you taking steps to
demonstrate that. You won’t
face these big decisions too
often, so she may adopt a
wait-and-see attitude. That
will be hard for you, I think.
Very hard.”
I nodded slowly, but I
couldn’t wait anymore. If Eva
needed proof that I’d do
anything to keep her, I would
give it to her.
My hands clenched into
fists. My gaze stayed on the
carpet between my feet. “I
was—” I cleared my throat.
“The therapist. The one I had
when I was a child.”
“Yes?”
“He … he molested me.
For nearly a year. He …
raped me.”

20
I miss you so much. Can’t we talk,
please? I need to see you.
“Still staring at that text?”
Cary asked, rolling onto his
back on the bed beside me
and pressing his temple to
mine.
“I can’t sleep.” It was
torture to stay away from
Gideon. I spent every minute
—waking and sleeping—
feeling like someone had
hacked out my heart and left
a gaping hole in my chest.
I looked up at the canopy
above my mom’s guest bed.
Like her sitting room, the
bedroom she’d put me in was
newly redecorated. With its
palette of cream and moss
green, the room was soothing
and tastefully elegant. The
guest bedroom Cary occupied
was done in a more masculine
style with grays and navy,
with walnut furnishings on
the opposite end of the
spectrum from the white
gilded pieces in my room.
“When are you going to
talk to him, baby girl?”
“Soon. I just …” I lowered
the phone to my chest and
pressed it against my heart. “I
think we both need a little
time.”
It was so hard to think
when Gideon and I were
fighting. I hated it.
And it was worse because
he was the one who’d fucked
up, and like everything he
did, he had done so
spectacularly. I couldn’t
imagine how I could forgive
him and live with myself. On
the other hand, I couldn’t
imagine how I could go
forward without him and live,
period. I felt dead inside. The
only thing keeping me going
was the belief that somehow
we’d work things out and be
together. How could we not?
How could I give so much of
myself to someone and then
let that person go?
I thought about the advice
I’d given to Trey and how we
were both facing the same
decision—did we choose love
or did we choose ourselves? I
was so pissed off at Gideon
for being the one who forced
my hand. I’d recognized that
certain situations were
pushing me into that spot, but
I had never thought my
husband would.
And why the hell did the
two choices have to be
mutually exclusive? It wasn’t
fair.
“You’re running him
through the wringer,” Cary
pointed out, unnecessarily.
“He’s done it, not me.”
Gideon had taken something
precious from me, but worse,
he had taken something
precious away from us—my
free will and the trust I’d
given him to respect it. After
that last night we’d had … as
much as I had trusted him and
opened myself to him … And
he’d already talked to Mark.
The feeling of betrayal was
heartrending. “Thanks for
sticking with me.”
He shrugged. “I like
Stanton. It’s no hardship
hanging at his place a few
days. We are eventually
going home, right?”
“I can’t hide forever.”
“So you’ve always said,”
he muttered. “Personally, I
like hiding. Just taking a
fucking break and forgetting
about all the crap.”
“But the crap’s always out
there waiting for you.” And
knowing that, I always
preferred to face it head-on.
Get it out of the way and
behind me.
“Let it wait,” he said,
reaching up to ruffle my hair.
Turning my head, I pressed
a kiss to his cheek. I’d cried
gallons on him the last three
days and curled up against
him at night. At times, it felt
like his arms were the only
things holding me together.
God. I hurt all over. I was a
fucking mess, a zombie in the
vibrantly lively city of New
York.
Where was Gideon now?
Was the pain of our
separation starting to ease?
Or was he still as devastated
by it as I was?
“Mark asked me to move
to Cross Industries with him,”
I said, just to force my mind
onto something else.
“Well, you saw that
coming.”
“I guess, but it was still
surreal when he brought it
up.” I sighed. “He’s so
excited, Cary. He’s getting a
hefty raise, and that will
change a lot of things for him
and Steven. They’ll be able to
afford a really fancy wedding
plus a long honeymoon, and
they’re looking for a
condominium now. It’s hard
to hold on to my resentment
when this is such a good
thing for him.”
“Are you going to work for
Gideon?”
“I don’t know. I wasn’t
kidding when I told him I was
halfway toward making that
decision on my own. But now
… I kinda want to apply
elsewhere just to spite him.”
Cary lifted his fists and
shadowboxed. “Show him
he’s not the boss of you.”
“Yeah.” I threw a few
punches, too, just to give
myself a little lift. “But that’s
stupid. I’d never know if I got
hired for me or for his name,
whether that turned out to be
a good or a bad thing.
Anyway, I’ve got a month
before Mark moves on. I’ve
got time to think about it.”
“Maybe Waters Field and
Leaman will keep you. Have
you considered that?”
“It’s a possibility. I’m not
sure how I would respond. It
would save me a job search,
but I wouldn’t have Mark,
and he’s the reason I love my
job. Would I still want to be
there without him?”
“You’d still have Megumi
and Will.”
“There’s that,” I agreed.
We lay there in
companionable silence for a
while.
Then he said, “So it looks
like you and me are just
floating around in the hell-if-
I-know boat.”
“Trey is going to call,” I
assured him, even though I
still had no idea what Trey
would say when he did.
“Sure. He’s a nice guy. He
won’t leave me hanging.”
Cary sounded so weary. “It’s
what he’s going to say, not
when, that’s the kicker.”
“I know. Love should be
easier than this,” I
complained.
“If this were a romantic
comedy, it’d be called Love
Actually Sucks.”
“Maybe we should’ve
stuck with Sex and the City.”
“Tried that. Ended up
Knocked Up. I should’ve
gone for being a 40-Year-Old
Virgin, but I had way too
much of a head start.”
“We can write a manual on
How to Lose a Guy in 10
Weeks.”
Cary looked at me.
“Fucking perfect.”
WEDNESDAY morning hit me
like a hangover.
Getting ready for work at
my mom’s place helped me to
not miss Gideon so much, but
it sure as hell didn’t separate
me from my mother, who was
driving me nuts talking about
the wedding nonstop. Even
Stanton, with his endless
capacity for indulging my
mom’s neurosis, gave me
sympathetic looks when he
was around.
I couldn’t think about the
wedding now. I couldn’t
think beyond each and every
hour of the day. That was
how I was getting by—one
hour at a time.
When I stepped out of the
lobby onto the street, I found
Angus waiting for me with
the Bentley rather than Raúl
with the Benz. I managed a
smile, genuinely pleased to
see him, but I was wary, too.
“Good morning, Angus.” I
jerked my chin toward the car
and whispered, “Is he in
there?”
He shook his head, then
touched the brim of his
vintage chauffeur’s hat.
“Good morning, Mrs. Cross.”
I squeezed his shoulder
briefly before sliding past the
door he opened and into the
backseat. In short order we
were easing into the snarl of
morning traffic and heading
toward midtown.
Leaning forward, I asked,
“How is he?”
“Worse than you, I
expect.” He glanced at me
briefly before returning his
attention to traffic. “He’s
suffering, lass. Last night was
the hardest.”
“God.” I sank back into the
seat, at a loss for what to do.
I didn’t want Gideon to
hurt. He’d been hurt too
much already.
Pulling out my
smartphone, I texted him. I
love you.
His reply was almost
immediate. Calling. Pls
answer.
A moment later the phone
vibrated in my hand and his
picture appeared on my
screen. It was like a quick
stab to the heart to see his
face after spending the last
few days avoiding any image
of him. I was equally afraid to
hear his voice. I didn’t know
if I could be strong. And I
didn’t have the answers he
needed from me.
My voice mail kicked in
and the phone quieted. It
started vibrating again right
away.
I answered, lifting the
phone to my ear without
speaking.
There was silence on the
line for a long, breathless
moment. “Eva?”
My eyes watered at the
sound of Gideon’s voice, the
rasp in it so deep, as if his
throat were rough. What was
worse was the hope I heard in
the way he said my name, the
desperate longing.
“It’s okay if you don’t
talk,” he said gruffly. “I just
…” He gave a shaky exhale.
“I’m sorry, Eva. I want you to
know I’m sorry and that I’ll
do whatever you need me to.
I just want to fix this.”
“Gideon …” I heard him
suck in a sharp inhalation
when I said his name. “I
believe that you’re sorry
we’re not together now. But I
also believe that you would
do something like this again.
I’m trying to figure out if I
can live with that.”
Silence hung on the line
between us.
“What does that mean?” he
asked finally. “What would
be the alternative?”
I sighed, suddenly feeling
so tired. “I don’t have any
answers. That’s why I’ve
stayed away. I want to give
you everything, Gideon. I
never want to say no to you,
it’s so hard for me. But right
now, I’m afraid that if I make
this compromise, if I stay
with you knowing how you
are and that you’re not going
to change, I’m just going to
resent you and, eventually,
fall out of love with you.”
“Eva … Christ. Don’t say
that!” His breath snagged. “I
told Dr. Petersen. About
Hugh.”
“What?” My head snapped
up. “When?”
“Last night. I told him
everything. About Hugh.
Anne. He’s going to help me,
Eva. He said some things …”
He paused. “They made sense
to me. About me and the way
I am with you.”
“Oh, Gideon.” I could
imagine how difficult that
must have been for him. I’d
lived through that confession
myself. “I’m very proud of
you. I know it wasn’t easy.”
“You have to stick with
me. You promised. I told you
I was going to fuck this up.
I’ll fuck up again. I don’t
know what the hell I’m
doing, but God … I love you.
I love you so fucking much. I
can’t do this without you. I
can’t live without you.
You’re breaking me, Eva. I
can’t …” He made a low,
pained noise. “I need you.”
“Ah God, Gideon.” Tears
poured down my face and
splattered onto my chest,
sliding down beneath the
neckline of my dress. “I don’t
know what to do, either.”
“Can’t we figure it out
together? Aren’t we better
—stronger—together?”
I wiped at my face,
knowing my makeup was
ruined and not caring. “I want
us to be. I want that more
than anything. I just don’t
know if we can get there.
There hasn’t been a single
time when you’ve let me
figure things out with you.
Not once.”
“If I did … if I do—and I
will—you’ll come back to
me?”
“I haven’t left you, Gideon.
I don’t know how.” I looked
out the window, spotted a
young couple kissing each
other good-bye in front of a
revolving door before the
man ran off. “But yes, if we
could really be a team,
nothing could keep me
away.”
“HEARD you guys landed the
PhazeOne campaign.”
I turned my attention from
the coffee I was sweetening
to raise my brows at Will. “I
haven’t heard that.”
He grinned, his eyes
sparkling behind his glasses.
He was such a happy guy,
anchored solidly in a
relationship that worked. I
was so envious of that
serenity. I had felt it only a
few times since I’d been with
Gideon, and every time it was
… bliss. How amazing would
it be if we could get there and
stay there?
“That’s the buzz I’ve been
hearing,” he said.
“Man.” I gave an
exaggerated sigh. “I am
always the last to know.”
I’d been putting on an
Oscar-worthy performance all
week. Between Mark’s
excitement, the imminent
adjustment in my work
situation, starting my period,
and dealing with the mess in
my private life, I was
focusing every ounce of
energy I had left on acting
calm. As a result, I’d avoided
the office gossip cliques to
limit my contact with people.
There was only so much
happiness/joy/contentment I
could fake.
“Mark’s going to kill me
for telling you.” Will looked
completely unapologetic. “I
wanted to be the first to
congratulate you.”
“Okay. Thank you.
Maybe.”
“I’m dying to get my hands
on that system, you know.
The tech blogs are wild with
rumors about PhazeOne’s
features.” He leaned against
the counter next to me and
gave me a hopeful look.
I wagged my finger at him.
“You won’t be hearing any
leaks from me.”
“Damn it. A guy’s gotta
hope.” He shrugged. “They’re
probably going to lock you in
solitary somewhere until the
release just to keep a lid on
it.”
“Makes you wonder why
LanCorp would take it to an
outside agency, doesn’t it?”
He frowned. “Yeah. I
guess. Hadn’t thought about
it.”
Neither had I. But Gideon
had.
I looked back down at my
mug, stirring absently.
“There’s a new GenTen
coming out soon.”
“I heard. That’s a nobrainer,
though. Everyone’s
going to buy it.”
Flexing my fingers, I
studied my wedding ring and
thought about the vows I’d
made when I accepted it.
“You got plans for lunch?”
he asked.
I picked up my mug and
faced him. “Yes, I’m going
out with Mark and his
partner.”
“Oh, right.” He moved
toward the coffeemaker when
I got out of the way. “Maybe
we could grab drinks after
work sometime this week.
Drag our significant others
with us. If Gideon’s up for it.
I know he’s a busy guy.”
I opened my mouth. Closed
it again. Will had given me
the perfect opening to excuse
Gideon. I could take it, but I
wanted to share the social
parts of my life with my
husband. I wanted him with
me. If I started excluding him
from my life, wasn’t that the
beginning of the end?
“Sounds like fun,” I lied,
imagining a tension-fraught
evening. “I’ll talk to him
about it. See what we can
work out.”
Will nodded. “Cool.
Lemme know.”
“I’VE got a problem.”
“Oh?” I looked across the
table at Mark. The Cuban
restaurant Steven had chosen
was both large and popular.
Sunlight streamed in through
a massive skylight, while
colorful murals decorated the
space with parrots and palm
fronds. Festive music made
me feel like I’d gone on
vacation to somewhere
exotic, while the rich smell of
spices made my tummy perk
up for the first time in days.
I rubbed my hands
together. “Let’s fix it.”
Steven nodded. “Eva’s
right. Lay it on us.”
Mark pushed the menu
aside and set his elbows on
the table. “So Mr. Waters told
me this morning to start
working on the LanCorp
brief.”
“Yay!” I applauded.
“Not so fast. In light of
that, I had to give him my
notice. I’d been hoping to
wait until Friday, but they
need someone who can stick
with the client all the way
through, not just the first
month.”
“You’ve got a point,” I
conceded, my smile fading.
“What a bummer, though.”
“It sucked, but …” He
shrugged. “It is what it is.
Then he called in the other
partners. They told me that
the LanCorp brass was
insistent that I head the
campaign when they first
approached the agency,
enough so that the partners
are worried they’ll lose the
account if I’m not managing
it.”
Steven grinned and slapped
him on the shoulder. “That’s
what we like to hear!”
Mark gave a sheepish
smile. “Yeah, it was a boost,
for sure. So anyway, they
offered me a promotion and a
raise if I’ll stay.”
“Whoa.” I sat back.
“That’s a serious boost.”
“They can’t offer what
Cross did. Not even half, but
let’s be honest, he’s
overpaying me.”
“Says you,” Steven
scoffed. “You’re worth every
penny.”
I nodded, even though I
had only a vague idea of what
Gideon had put on the table.
“I agree with that.”
“But I feel like I owe
Waters Field and Leaman
some loyalty.” Mark rubbed
at his jaw. “They’ve been
good to me and they want to
keep me, even knowing I can
be poached by someone else.”
“You’ve given them good
work for years,” Steven
countered. “They got a lot out
of you. You don’t owe them
any favors.”
“I know that. And I was
fine with leaving an empty
office behind, because they
could fill that quick enough.
But I’m having a hard time
with possibly costing them
the LanCorp campaign when
I go.”
“But that decision isn’t
yours to make,” I pointed out.
“If LanCorp doesn’t retain
the agency, that’s up to
them.”
“I’ve tried spinning it that
way, too. But it’s still not
something I want to see
happen.”
The server came by to take
our order. I looked at Steven.
“Can you do the honors?”
“Sure.” He looked at Mark,
who gave a quick nod to
signal the same request.
Steven ordered for all of us.
I waited until we were
alone again to speak, unsure
of how to say what needed to
be said. In the end, I went
with blunt. “I can’t work on
the PhazeOne campaign.”
Mark and Steven stared at
me.
“Look, the Landons and
the Crosses go way back,” I
explained, “and there’s bad
blood between them.
Gideon’s got some concerns,
and I see his point. It’s strong
enough for me to be
cautious.”
Mark frowned. “Landon
knows who you are. He
doesn’t have a problem with
it.”
“I know. But the PhazeOne
system is a pretty big deal.
There’s risk involved with
having access to it, and I
don’t need to contribute to
that in any way.” It was hard
admitting that Gideon was
right, because I knew I was
right, too. Which left us at an
impasse I didn’t know how to
get around.
Steven leaned closer and
studied me. “You’re serious.”
“Afraid so. Not that your
decision is in any way
affected by me, Mark, but I
thought I should put that out
there.”
“I’m not sure I
understand,” Mark said.
“She’s telling you that if
you stay with your job, you’ll
be losing both the money and
your assistant,” Steven
clarified. “Or you can move
to Cross Industries as you’ve
already agreed to do, get the
money, and keep Eva.”
“Well …” God. This was
harder than I’d thought it
would be. I had heard it but
now I was living it: Any
woman who loses or gives up
a job she loves because of a
man will resent it … What
had ever made me think I
would be somehow exempt?
“I can’t say yet that I’ll be
making the move with you.”
Mark fell back against the
burgundy vinyl booth. “This
just keeps getting worse.”
“I’m not saying
definitively that I won’t.” I
tried to shrug it off as no big
deal. “I’m just not sure that
Gideon and I should be
working together. I mean I’m
not sure he should be my boss
… or whatever. You know
what I mean.”
“I hate to say it,” Steven
said, “but she’s got a point.”
“This is not helping my
problem,” Mark muttered.
“I’m sorry.” I couldn’t tell
them how sorry I really was. I
didn’t even feel like I could
offer advice. How could I be
nonbiased about Mark’s
options?
“On the bright side,” I
offered instead, “you’re
definitely a hot commodity.”
Steven elbowed Mark with
a grin. “I knew that already.”
“So”—Cary slung his arm
around me when I curled into
his side—“here we are
again.”
Another night at my
mom’s. She’d finally gotten
suspicious, considering it was
our fourth night in a row at
her place. I confessed to
arguing with Gideon, but not
why. I didn’t think she would
understand. I’m sure she
would think it was perfectly
normal for a man in Gideon’s
position to handle all the
pesky little details. And as for
me possibly losing my job?
Why would I want to work
when I had no financial
reason to?
She didn’t understand.
Some daughters wanted to
grow up to be just like their
mothers; I wanted the
opposite. And my need to be
the anti-Monica was the main
reason I struggled so much
with what Gideon had done.
Any advice from her would
only make things worse. I
almost resented her as much
as I did him.
“We’ll go home
tomorrow,” I said.
After all, I’d be seeing
Gideon at Dr. Petersen’s
office at the very least. I was
desperately curious about
how that would go. I couldn’t
help but hope that Gideon had
turned a major corner with
therapy. If so, maybe there
were other corners we could
turn. Together.
I crossed my fingers.
And really, I had to give
Gideon credit for doing his
best to give me the space I’d
asked for. He could’ve caught
me in an elevator or the lobby
of the Crossfire. He could
have told Raúl to drive me to
him instead of wherever I
directed. Gideon was trying.
“Have you heard from
Trey?” I asked.
It was kind of miraculous
how often Cary and I ended
up in the same place at the
same time. Or maybe it was a
shared curse.
“He sent me a text saying
he was thinking about me but
wasn’t ready to talk yet.”
“Well, that’s something.”
His hand ran up and down
my back. “Is it?”
“Yes,” I said. “I’m in the
same place with Gideon. I
think about him all the time,
but I don’t have anything to
say to him right now.”
“So what’s next? Where do
you go from here? When do
you decide you’ve got
something more to say?”
I thought about that a
minute, absently watching
Harrison Ford hunt for
answers in The Fugitive,
which we had on mute.
“When something changes, I
guess.”
“When he changes, you
mean. What if he doesn’t?”
I didn’t have that answer
yet, and when I tried to think
about it, I went a little crazy.
So I asked Cary a question
instead. “I know you want to
put the baby first and that’s
the right thing to do. But
Tatiana’s not happy. And
you’re not, either. Trey’s
definitely not. This isn’t
working out for any of you.
Have you thought about
being with Trey and the two
of you helping Tatiana with
the baby?”
He snorted. “She’s not
gonna go for that. If she’s
miserable, everyone else has
to be, too.”
“I don’t think that should
be her choice to make. She’s
as responsible for getting
pregnant as you are. You
don’t have to do some sort of
penance, Cary.” I put my
hand over the arm he had
lying in his lap, my thumb
brushing carefully over the
fresh scars on his inner
forearm. “Be happy with
Trey. Make him happy. And
if Tatiana can’t be happy with
having two hot guys looking
after her, then she’s … not
doing something right.”
Cary laughed softly and
pressed his lips to the crown
of my head. “Solve your own
problem that easily.”
“I wish I could.” I wished
for that more than anything.
But I knew it wouldn’t be
easy.
And I feared it might be
impossible.
THE vibration of my
smartphone woke me.
When I realized what the
buzzing was, I began
searching blindly for my
phone, my hands sliding
around the bed until I found
it. By then, I’d missed the
call.
Squinting at the glaringly
bright screen, I saw it was
just past three A.M. and
Gideon had called. My heart
skipped as worry chased
away sleep. Once again I’d
gone to bed cradling my
phone, unable to stop reading
the many texts he had sent
me.
I called him back.
“Angel,” he answered on
the first ring, his voice
hoarse.
“Is everything okay?”
“Yes. No.” He blew out his
breath. “I had a nightmare.”
“Oh.” I blinked up at the
canopy that I couldn’t see in
the dark. My mother was a
fan of blackout drapes, saying
they were necessary in a city
that was never truly dark.
“I’m sorry.”
It was a lame reply, but
what else could I say? It
would be pointless to ask if
he wanted to talk about it. He
never did.
“I’m having them a lot
lately,” he said wearily.
“Every time I fall asleep.”
My heart hurt a little more.
It seemed impossible that it
could take so much pain, but
there was always more. I’d
learned that long ago.
“You’re stressed, Gideon.
I’m not sleeping well, either.”
And then, because it had to be
said, “I miss you.”
“Eva …”
“Sorry.” I scrubbed at my
eyes. “Maybe I shouldn’t say
that.”
Maybe it was a mixed
signal that would only make
things worse for him. I felt
guilty for staying away, even
though I knew I had good
reason to.
“No, I need to hear it. I’m
scared, Eva. I’ve never felt
fear like this. I’m afraid you
won’t come back … that you
won’t give me another
chance.”
“Gideon—”
“I dreamed about my father
at first. We were walking on
the beach and he was holding
my hand. I’ve been dreaming
about the beach a lot lately.”
I swallowed hard, my chest
aching. “Maybe that means
something.”
“Maybe. I was little in the
dream. I had to look up a long
way to see my dad’s face. He
was smiling, but then I
always remember him
smiling. Even though I heard
him fighting with my mom a
lot toward the end, I can’t
remember any other
expression on his face but a
smile.”
“I’m sure you made him
happy. And proud. He
probably always smiled when
he looked at you.”
He was quiet for a minute,
and I thought maybe that was
it. Then he went on. “I saw
you up ahead on the beach,
walking away from us.”
I rolled onto my side,
listening intently.
“Your hair was blowing in
the breeze and the sun lit it
up. I thought it was beautiful.
I pointed you out to my dad. I
wanted you to turn your head
so we could see your face. I
knew you were gorgeous. I
wanted him to see you.”
Tears welled in my eyes
and slid down to wet my
pillow.
“I tried to run after you. I
was pulling at his hand and
he was holding me back,
laughing about chasing pretty
girls at my age.”
I could picture the scene so
clearly in my mind. I could
almost feel the brisk breeze
whipping through my hair
and hear the seagulls calling.
I could see the young Gideon
in the picture he’d given me
and the handsome,
charismatic Geoffrey Cross.
I wanted a future like that.
With Gideon walking down
the beach with our son who
looked just like him, my
husband laughing because our
troubles were behind us and a
bright, happy future lay ahead
of us.
But he’d called it a
nightmare, so I knew that
future I envisioned wasn’t
one he saw.
“I was tugging so hard on
his hand,” he continued,
“digging my bare feet into the
sand for traction. But he was
so much stronger than me.
You were walking farther and
farther away. He laughed
again. Only this time, it
wasn’t his laugh. It was
Hugh’s. And when I looked
up again, it wasn’t my father
anymore.”
“Oh, Gideon.” I sobbed his
name, unable to hold back the
sympathy and grief. And the
relief that he was talking to
me at last.
“He told me you didn’t
want me, that you were going
away because you knew
everything and it made you
sick. That you couldn’t get
away fast enough.”
“That’s not true!” I sat up
in bed. “You know that’s not
true. I love you. It’s because I
love you so much that I’m
thinking so hard about this.
Us.”
“I’m trying to give you
space. But I feel like it would
be so easy for us to drift
apart. A day goes by, then
another. You’ll find a new
routine without me in it …
Christ, Eva, I don’t want you
to get over me.”
I spoke in a rush, my
thoughts tumbling out of my
mouth. “There’s a way to get
through this, Gideon, I know
there is. But when I’m with
you I lose myself in you. I
just want to be with you and
to be happy, so I let things
ride and put them off. We
make love and I think we’ll
be okay, because we have
that and it’s perfect.”
“It is perfect. It’s
everything.”
“When you’re inside me,
looking at me, I feel like we
can conquer anything. But
we’ve really got to work on
this! We can’t be afraid to
deal with our baggage
because we don’t want to lose
each other.”
He growled softly. “I just
want us to spend time
together not dealing with all
this other shit!”
“I know.” I rubbed at the
pain in my chest. “But we
have to earn it, I think. We
can’t manufacture it by
running away for a weekend
or a week.”
“How do we earn it?”
I swiped at the tears drying
on my cheeks. “Tonight was
good. You calling me, telling
me about your dream. It’s a
good step, Gideon.”
“We’ll keep making steps,
then. We have to keep
moving together or we’re
going to end up moving apart.
Don’t let that happen! I’m
fighting here, with everything
I’ve got. Fight for me, too.”
My eyes stung with fresh
tears. I sat for a while, crying,
knowing he could hear me
and that it was hurting him.
Finally, I swallowed the
pain down and made a snap
decision. “I’m going to that
all-night café on Broadway
and Eighty-fifth for coffee
and a croissant.”
He was silent for a long
minute. “What? Now?”
“Right now.” I tossed back
the covers on the bed and slid
to the floor.
Then he got it. “Okay.”
Killing the call, I dropped
the phone on the bed and
fumbled for the light. I ran to
my duffel bag, digging out
the butter yellow maxi dress
I’d shoved in there because it
was easy to pack and
comfortable to wear.
Now that I was decided on
seeing Gideon, I was anxious
to get to him, but I had my
vanity, too. I took the time to
brush out my hair and put a
little makeup on. I didn’t
want him to see me after four
days and wonder why he was
so gone over me.
My phone buzzed a
notification of a text and I
hurried over to it, seeing a
note from Raúl: I’m out front
with the car.
A little zing went through
me. Gideon was anxious to
see me, too. Still, he never
missed a trick.
I shoved my phone into my
purse, my feet into sandals,
and hurried out to the
elevator.
GIDEON was waiting on the
street when Raúl pulled up to
the curb. Many of the
storefronts on Broadway were
shuttered and dark, although
the street itself remained well
lit. My husband stood within
the light cast by the café’s
awning, his hands shoved into
the pockets of his dark jeans
and a Yankees ball cap
tugged low over his brow.
He could’ve been any
young man out late at night.
Clearly attractive by the way
his hard body filled his
clothes and the confidence in
the way he carried himself. I
would’ve given him a second
and third look. He wasn’t as
intimidating outside the threepiece
suits he wore so well,
but he was still dark and
dangerous enough to hold me
back from the lighthearted
flirting most devastatingly
handsome men inspired.
In jeans or Fioravanti,
Gideon Cross was not a man
to be taken lightly.
He was at the car almost
before Raúl pulled to a
complete stop, yanking the
door open and then freezing
in place, staring at me with
such scorching hunger and
possessiveness that I found it
hard to breathe.
I swallowed past the lump
in my throat, my equally
ravenous gaze sliding all over
him. He was unbelievably
more beautiful, the expertly
sculpted planes of his face
honed further by his torment.
How had I lived the past few
days without seeing that face?
He held his hand out to me
and I reached for it, my own
trembling in anticipation of
his touch. The brush of his
skin against mine sent tingles
of awareness racing through
me, my bruised heart surging
with life at being in contact
with him again.
He helped me out, then
pushed the door closed,
rapping twice on the roof to
send Raúl away. As the Benz
left us, we stood barely a foot
apart, the air crackling with
tension between us. A taxi
raced by, honking its horn as
another car turned onto
Broadway without looking.
The harsh sound jolted
Gideon and me both.
He took a step toward me,
his eyes dark and hot beneath
the brim of his hat. “I’m
going to kiss you,” he said
roughly.
Then he cupped my jaw
and tilted his head, fitting his
mouth over mine. His lips, so
soft and firm and dry, pressed
mine open. His tongue slid
deep and rubbed, withdrew,
slid deep again. He groaned
as if he were in the greatest
pain. Or pleasure. For me, it
was both. The hot stroke of
his tongue into my mouth was
like a sweet, slow fucking.
Smoothly rhythmic, skilled,
with just the perfect tease of
leashed passion.
I moaned as euphoria
sparkled through me like
champagne, the ground
shifting beneath my feet so
that I clung to him for
balance, my hands wrapping
around his wrists.
I whimpered in protest
when he pulled away, my lips
feeling achy and swollen, my
sex wet with desire.
“You’ll make me come,”
he murmured, unable to resist
brushing his lips over mine
one last time. “I’m right
there.”
“I don’t care.”
His mouth curved and
chased the shadows away.
“The next time I come will be
inside you.”
I sucked in a shaky breath
at the thought. I wanted that,
and yet I knew it would be
too soon now. That we’d fall
too easily back into the
unhealthy pattern we had
established. “Gideon …”
His smile turned rueful.
“Guess we’ll settle for coffee
and a croissant for now.”
I loved him so much in that
moment. Impulsively, I
pulled off his hat and gave
him a great big smacking kiss
on the mouth.
“God,” he breathed, his
gaze so tender it made me
feel like crying again. “I’ve
missed you so damn much.”
I slid the hat back on his
head and grabbed his hand,
leading him around the little
metal fences cordoning off an
outside seating area from the
pedestrian traffic. We entered
the café and settled at a table
by the window, Gideon on
one side and me on the other.
But we didn’t stop holding
hands, our fingers stroking
and rubbing, each of us
touching the other’s wedding
bands.
We ordered when the
server walked over with the
menus, then turned our
attention back to each other.
“I’m not even hungry,” I
told him.
“Not for food, anyway,” he
rejoined.
I shot him a mock glare
that made him smile. Then I
told him about the retention
offer Waters Field & Leaman
had made Mark.
It seemed wrong to talk
about something so practical,
so mundane, when my heart
was giddy with love and
relief, but we had to keep
talking. Reconnecting wasn’t
enough; I wanted a full and
total reconciliation. I wanted
to move into the renovated
penthouse with him, start our
life together. To do that, we
had to keep communicating
about the things we’d spent
our relationship avoiding.
Gideon nodded grimly
when I finished. “I’m not
surprised. An account like
that should be handled by one
of the partners. Mark’s good,
but he’s a junior manager.
LanCorp would’ve had to
push to get him. And you.
The request is unusual
enough to give the partners
cause for concern.”
I thought about Kingsman
Vodka. “You did the same
thing.”
“I did, yes.”
“I don’t know what he’s
going to do.” I looked at our
joined hands. “But I told him
I couldn’t work on the
PhazeOne campaign even if
he stayed to manage it.”
Gideon’s grip tightened on
mine.
“You have good reasons
for doing the things you do,”
I said quietly, “even if I don’t
like them.”
He took a slow, deep
breath. “Will you come with
him to Cross Industries if he
moves?”
“I’m not sure yet. I’m
feeling pretty resentful right
now. Unless that changes, it
wouldn’t be a healthy
working relationship for
either of us.”
He nodded. “Fair enough.”
The server came back with
our order. Gideon and I
released each other by
necessity to give her room to
put the plates on our settings.
When she walked away, a
heavy silence descended
between us. There was so
much to say, but so much that
had to be figured out first.
He cleared his throat.
“Tonight—after Dr. Petersen
—could I take you out to
dinner?”
“Yes.” I accepted eagerly,
grateful to move past the
awkwardness into action. “I’d
like that.”
I could see similar relief
soften the hard line of his
shoulders and wanted to do
my share to build it. “Will
asked if we’d be up for
grabbing a drink with him
and Natalie this week.”
A hint of a smile touched
Gideon’s mouth. “I think
that’d be great.”
Small steps. We would
start with those and see where
they took us.
I pushed back from the
table and stood. Gideon
pushed to his feet quickly,
eyeing me warily. I rounded
the table and took the seat
next to him, waiting until he
sat again so that I could lean
into him.
His arm came around me
and he settled me into the
crook of his neck. A soft
sound escaped him when I
snuggled in.
“I’m still mad at you,” I
told him.
“I know.”
“And I’m still in love with
you.”
“Thank God.” His cheek
rested against the top of my
head. “We’ll figure out the
rest. We’ll get back on track.”
We sat together and
watched the city rouse from
sleep. The sky lightened. The
pace of life quickened.
It was a new day, bringing
with it a new chance to try
again.
