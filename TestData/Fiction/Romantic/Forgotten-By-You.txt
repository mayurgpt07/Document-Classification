Chapter One
CHARLIE
New Year’s Day
“That was some party, wasn’t it?” I asked Mitch as he drove us home. “What a way to start the New
Year.”
“Yep.”
“I can’t believe Natalie and Mac actually got married in Vegas. How did we not know? She’s so good
at keeping secrets,” I said, slightly shaking my head.
“Yeah, that’s a good trait.”
“You didn’t seem too surprised today when they announced they were married in Vegas. Why is that?”
I eyed Mitch suspiciously. A grin spread across his handsome face, his eyes crinkling in the corners.
“I already knew, sweetie.”
“What? How did you know and I didn’t?” I couldn’t believe it. Natalie was one of my best friends.
“You’re on an as-needs-to-know basis,” he said, glancing over at me, his eyes lit with mischief. That
was my man. He always had a way of knowing things. He could read people and find out just about
anything about them.
I rolled my eyes. “When did you find out?”
“Mac told us when we went golfing.”
“You mean to tell me you’ve known about this for the last few weeks and didn’t tell me? I can’t
believe you, Mitch Hawkins,” I said, pretending to punch him in the arm. It was really just a tap, since I
didn’t wanna hurt my hand on his steely muscles. “I can’t believe Mac couldn’t keep a secret when
Natalie could.” Men. And they say we talk too much. I had to laugh to myself.
“Apparently so. I promised not to tell, so I didn’t,” he said, continuing his cat-that-swallowed-thecanary
grin. He was having way too much fun knowing about something I hadn’t known.
“Well, the important thing is Natalie’s very happy. Mac brings out the best in her,” I said, a little teary
eyed. We pulled into our garage and Mitch turned off the car. Looking over at me, he said, “How are you
feeling about your two best friends getting married so quickly and extravagantly?”
“I’m thrilled for them,” I said, but deep down I was a little envious. I didn’t really want to admit that to
anyone…even my fiancé. But Mitch was a perceptive man and had a way of pulling things out of me, even
when I didn’t want to divulge them. One of the many things I loved about him.
“Charlie,” Mitch said, taking my hand. “It’s only human to feel a little jealous.”
Damn it! “I’m not jealous. They both deserve to be happy, really,” I insisted. Am I trying to convince
him or myself?
Mitch tilted his head, his ruggedly handsome face looking at me with all the love in the world. His blue
eyes pierced right through me—and my defenses. “I don’t have the kind of money Neil and Mac have.
We’re never gonna own an oceanfront home or a yacht or fancy cars.”
I pressed my fingers lightly to his lips. “What we have is far more precious than anything that can be
bought, Mitch. I wouldn’t trade you for all the money in the world. You’re the only man for me. You’re the
only thing I need.”
Mitch took hold of my fingers and kissed them. “Let’s go inside, beautiful,” he said, his desire for me
alight in his eyes. No one could love me like he did.
Chapter Two
MITCH
I watched as Charlie got out of the car, taking in the view of the curve from her waist to her hip, her
long dark hair cascading down her back. She was the most gorgeous creature on the face of this earth. I
was going to do everything in my power to love her like she deserved and make her happy. I had loved
her since the moment we met, and she was the only woman for me. She was the perfect combination of
submissive with some sassy mixed in.
Right now, I knew exactly what she needed. After opening the door that led inside our townhouse, I
scooped her up over my shoulder.
“Mitch,” she squealed.
I swatted her perfect ass. “You’re not gonna think about anything but me for the rest of the night. Trust
me.”
I continued to our bedroom and put her feet on the floor. Turning her body around, I whispered,
“Sweetie, you look so hot in this little tight dress. I’ve been waiting all day to lift your skirt up and do all
sorts of things to you.” My hands slid up her side and found their way to her breasts that I loved to have
my hands and mouth on.
Her moan let me know I was headed in the right direction. I walked her toward the wall so she could
steady herself, lifted her skirt, and pulled down her thong. Making my way to her sweet spot, I slid my
finger right in.
“Mm…you’re so ready for me,” I said, my breathing becoming heavy. There was nothing like being
with my girl.
Nipping at her ear, I undid my belt, unzipped my pants, and pulled them down along with my boxers.
“Turn around,” I whispered. Without a word, she slowly pivoted on her heel, and I stepped out of my
pants. I pressed her against the wall, kissing her while my hands tightened around her ass. Sliding her up
the wall, I whispered, “Wrap your legs around me.” As she did, I slipped inside her, filling her like I
always did, hearing the moan I loved so much.
My fingers dug into her hips as I thrust in and out of her slowly. She kept her gorgeous eyes on me like
she always did when we were together. “Charlie. You. Feel. So. Good.” Each word came out slowly as I
thrust into her.
“So do you, baby,” she said after a deep sigh.
“This is just the beginning, baby.”
Chapter Three
CHARLIE
Mitch did as he promised and I thought of nothing but him for the rest of the night. He had a way of
taking over and ruling me—heart, mind, body, and soul. He was an in-charge kind of guy and I loved that
about him. It was evident from the moment we met at San Diego State.
I was in class with my soon to be ex-boyfriend, although my ex hadn’t known it at the time. It was the
first day and I was excited to have classes with my friend, Kate. She and I had gone to middle school
together but not high school, so we’d lost touch for years before running into each other at the Del Mar
Fair during the summer. She was with her boyfriend at the time, David, and I was with—I don’t even
wanna think of his name—Eric. Kate and I picked up right where we’d left off, the sign of a true
friendship.
I was deep in thought thinking about how to break up with Eric when Kate, David, and Mitch arrived
in class. David introduced Mitch to me, and from the second my hand was in his, I felt it. Chemistry.
Something about Mitch beckoned me to him like a ship to a lighthouse in a storm. Something in his kind
face and handsome smile made me feel safe.
Eric felt it too, because jealousy and anger oozed from his body. I could tell by his stance. He was
almost in fight mode, although fighting with Mitch would’ve been pointless. Mitch was like a mountain
compared to Eric.
It was undeniable—the pull Mitch and I had between us. It was like two magnets having to connect
because there was simply no choice. I attempted to downplay the smile on my face while we exchanged
the common pleasantries. Mitch’s expression was one of warmth, with a hint of invitation, making me melt
on the inside. There we were, having a private moment. The only problem was it was in front of
everyone.
More students came into the classroom, and Kate, David, and Mitch found seats. So, there I was, with
Eric to my left and Mitch to my right. I could feel the tension emanating from Eric and I knew I was in for
it the moment we were alone. His jaw was tight and his nostrils flared. He had a temper. A really bad
temper. I was beginning to think he might hit me or worse in one of his rages, making me both afraid to
stay with him and afraid to break up with him.
When class was over, we all decided to get something to eat. Eric begrudgingly agreed and I was
grateful to not have to be alone with him yet. He and I were the last ones to walk out of the classroom, and
he grabbed my arm and squeezed so tightly I thought he was going to break it. I couldn’t help crying out
and Mitch heard me. He turned around to see Eric glaring at me, giving me a warning look that said I
better behave the way he wanted me to or else.
Mitch stopped in his tracks, his fists clenched. “Looks like you’re hurting her, man. I suggest you
let go.”
Looking at Mitch, I saw a knight in shining armor swooping in to rescue me.
“I’m not hurting you, am I, Charlie?” Eric asked in a chilling tone.
It was time to find my backbone and be free from Eric. “Yes, you are,” I said in a quiet voice, tears
beginning to well in my eyes.
“Let her go, or you and I have a problem,” Mitch said with a feral look on his face.
When I saw the fierceness Mitch displayed in protection of me, that was it. I chose him. Period. Kate
and David had turned around when they noticed we weren’t behind them and were watching the scene
unfold before their eyes. I could tell by the look on Kate’s face she was worried.
Eric wisely let go. “This isn’t over,” he said against my ear in a menacing voice.
I looked him square in the face, finding courage I didn’t know I had. “Yes, it is. We’re over. I don’t
ever want you to touch me again.”
“We’re over when I say so,” Eric retorted. “And that’s not today.”
Mitch took a step forward, his large muscular frame overshadowing Eric. “Man, if she wants to
break up with you, then that’s what’s happening.”
During a split second, it seemed as though Eric was deciding if he really wanted to tangle with
Mitch, who looked like a linebacker. “It’s not worth it. You’re not worth all this trouble, Charlie,” he
said, and then stormed off. I could feel tears forming, but they weren’t from pain, but from
embarrassment. I was shaking. How had I ever felt good with Eric?
Mitch gently took my hand. “Charlie, are you okay?”
“I am now. Thank you. He’s really become scary in the last few months, and I don’t know what he
might do next.”
“You don’t have to worry about anything. I’ve got you.”
Between the intensity of his words and his gentle blue eyes, which were looking at me in adoration,
I was…his. He already had my heart and I knew I never wanted it back.
Mitch just naturally began guiding me out of the hallway toward Montezuma Hall, where students
ate lunch. He didn’t let go of my hand and I didn’t want him to.
We had lunch with Kate and David, but afterward, Mitch walked me back to my dorm. The entire
time I was on the lookout for Eric, nervous about what he might do to me. But Mitch put his arm
around me and said, “I won’t let him near you ever again. You don’t have to be scared.”
“How did you know?”
“By your expression and how much you’re looking around. You’ve got me, Charlie. I don’t know
how or why, but I just know. We’re meant to be.”
While I stared into Mitch’s handsome face, all I could see was sincerity. I believed him because I’d
felt it too from the second our hands touched. We were meant to be.
I touched my arm in the place where Eric had left a bruise on my body for several weeks. I never had
to deal with him again, at least not up close and personal. He’d watch me from afar, but Mitch was
always a deterrent, causing Eric to maintain his distance. That was seven years ago, and now Mitch and I
were engaged to be married.
Mitch pulled me close to him as we lay in our bed, exhausted from our evening. “What’s going on in
that beautiful head of yours, soon-to-be Mrs. Hawkins?”
I loved it when he called me that. “I was just thinking about the day we met.”
“That was the best day of my life so far,” he said while he nuzzled my ear.
“Mine too,” I replied in complete satisfaction. “I don’t know what would’ve happened if you hadn’t
have been there.”
Mitch turned me on my back so we could look into each other’s eyes. “You’d have found a way to get
rid of him. You just didn’t realize how strong you were back then.”
“Strange how being with someone can actually change you, bring out either your best or worst. I
wasn’t me when I was with Eric. I’d become unsure of myself. He somehow…I don’t know…
brainwashed me, convincing me no one else would want me.”
“Well, you know that’s not true. You’re sexy as hell and turn heads wherever we go,” Mitch said,
looking at me the way he always did, with pure love on his face. It had been his confidence and affirming
love that had helped me become who I was today. I felt strong. I felt cherished. I felt adored.
I smiled and stroked my man’s chiseled jaw. “I only have eyes for you.”
Chapter Four
MITCH
I continued holding my girl until she fell asleep. I couldn’t quite join her, as my mind was reviewing
all we’d experienced in recent days. The last few months, Charlie had watched as her two closest friends,
Kate and Natalie, were swept away by romantic gestures that’d rival those of any romance novel. I was
romantic in my own way, but quite frankly, Neil and Mac had put me to shame. I’d thought Kate and Neil
had a whirlwind romance, but then Mac came along, outdoing Neil in his quest to win Natalie’s heart. It
also didn’t hurt that they were both wealthy and could make anything happen whenever they wanted.
I could do the everyday things like flowers, candlelit dinners, weekend getaways. I knew Charlie said
she didn’t care about money, but part of me felt she deserved more than me. Way more. She could get any
man she wanted. Is she settling for me?
I had to push those thoughts out of my head. I didn’t know why I was feeling insecure, because Charlie
was down to earth and her parents had raised her to be grateful for what she had. She was kind, loving,
generous, feisty, and sexier than any woman I’d ever known. She was the total package and all my friends
over the years had told me how lucky I was to have her. Never once had she indicated she was envious of
what other people had.
All she wanted was marriage and family. That, I could provide. Maybe part of me wanted more for her
than what I could give, but being selfish, I wasn’t about to give her up to a rich guy. She was all mine, and
I was going to take better care of her than anyone else ever could. No other woman in this world
compared to her, and my desperation to have her all to myself had grown exponentially since we’d
become engaged. Charlie becoming my wife was all I could think about.
I continued watching my beautiful girl sleeping until I finally dozed off.
“Mm, I’m so happy, Mitch. What made you think of this, baby?”
“It’s our first year anniversary and I wanted us to have a very romantic evening,” I said, holding
my girl close. She was leaning against my chest and we were both looking out on the Pacific Ocean
from the yacht. All I cared about was her happiness. She meant more to me than I could even measure.
Charlie turned in my arms. “This is the perfect night. I love that you thought of a dinner cruise for
our anniversary,” she said, reaching up on her tiptoes to kiss me.
My plan was to make every anniversary unique and special because Charlie was the most important
person in my life. Knowing she was content was all I needed.
Chapter Five
CHARLIE
January
The excitement in the lives of my two best friends had finally subsided and I was beginning to plan for
my own wedding. Mitch, however, had another idea in mind.
“I know you wanted six months to a year to plan our wedding, but honestly I don’t think we need that
much time.”
“We don’t?” I asked with raised eyebrows.
“No, we don’t.”
I thought for a moment. Perhaps he was right. We were saving for a wedding, but what really mattered
was our marriage.
“What are you thinking?” he asked.
“I’m thinking maybe you’re right. It’s you I want, Mitch. I don’t need anything fancy, just to be your
wife, so I’d be more than happy with something simple in my parents’ backyard.”
“Yeah, we could do that, or I could talk to my mom about having it in my parents’ backyard. It’s quite a
bit bigger than your parents’ yard.”
I willed myself not to roll my eyes. “Are you sure your mom would be up for that? She isn’t exactly
thrilled we’re getting married.”
Mitch began to say something, then stopped himself. He tilted his head slightly and picked up my hand.
“Sweetie, I know she’s been hard on you, but it’d mean so much to me if you kept giving her another
chance. I think she’ll come around eventually.”
“She might, but I don’t feel comfortable having our wedding at her home. I just feel like I’d have to do
things her way.”
Mitch nodded. “I want to promise you something.”
“Promise me something? What do you wanna promise me?” I asked, stroking his arm with my hand,
staring into his handsome face. His piercing blue eyes always kept me captivated.
“You will always come before my mom and I’ll make sure she knows I’ll choose you over her no
matter what.”
I kissed Mitch for his sweetness. “I love that promise.”
“My mom wants to be in control, but I’m not gonna let her control us. I love you more than anyone or
anything else in this world. You know that, right?”
“Oh, Mitch. I’m so lucky to have you. I’m sorry it’s been rough between her and me. I know you’ll
always protect us. Thank you, baby.”
“I will always protect us, baby. No one’s more important to me than you.”
He was a hunk of a man, but had a tender side that melted my insides and I adored him for putting me
first.
“So, getting back to the wedding, your parents’ house sometime in the next six weeks?”
“The next six weeks,” I exclaimed. “That’s not a lot of time.”
“But you already found your dress and have it ordered. When will it be in?”
“Sometime next week.”
“Isn’t that the most important thing?” Mitch asked, grinning.
“Yes, the dress is pretty high on the list,” I said, chuckling at my very smart man. “Well, let’s look at a
calendar and choose a date.”
“Good,” Mitch said. “I can’t wait to make you Mrs. Hawkins.”
How could I argue with that? We had been together since the first day of college. Our relationship had
become seasoned over many years, which had demonstrated just how much we were meant to be. Mitch
was right. Why wait?
Mitch had pulled up a calendar on his phone. “We could get married on February 22nd or push it to
March 1st? What do you think about those dates?”
“Are both of those days on a Saturday?”
“Yes,” Mitch said, handing me his phone.
“Let’s go for February 22nd. I’ll call my parents and let them know.”
After talking with my mom, I was glad Mitch had come up with the idea to get married sooner. My
mom was so excited about having the wedding at my childhood home. It’d be the perfect setting,
especially since Mitch proposed to me there. The change was also good because it’d cost less and mean
the money we had could go toward buying our first place. I wanted a home with Mitch more than I wanted
an elaborate party.
“My parents love your idea, babe,” I said, as I returned to the living room.
“I figured they would.”
“Dad’s excited to spruce up the house. He’s gonna take down the Christmas lights today.”
Mitch scrunched his nose. “Do you think your dad should be up on a ladder?”
“Well, I think he’ll be okay.”
Mitch picked up his phone and began texting. “I told him we’re coming over and I’m gonna take down
the lights. You and your mom can spend time planning while we’re out doing the man’s work.”
“The man’s work?” I questioned sarcastically.
Mitch flexed his right arm, showing off his muscles.
I reached out and felt them. “Nice,” I said, giving him my bedroom eyes.
“Don’t distract me now. Your dad’s expecting us,” Mitch said, pulling me into his arms.
“Love you, Charlie,” he said quietly in my ear.
“Love you too, Mitch. Can’t wait to be your wife,” I said, melting into him.
Chapter Six
MITCH
When Charlie told me her dad was going to take down the lights, I knew I wasn’t going to let that
happen. Her dad had married her mom when he was in his forties, so by my estimation, he was getting
close to seventy. He was still in good shape, but it just didn’t feel right for him to take down the lights I
had put up. If anything happened to Charlie’s dad, I’d never forgive myself.
When we arrived at her parents’ home, Tom was already outside. I could tell he was in his element by
the gleam in his eye. He’d do anything for his daughter. She was the sun in his universe.
“There’s the happy couple,” he called out as we approached.
“Hi, Daddy,” Charlie said, making her way to hug him. I took a second to look around and saw just
how perfect the location was for our wedding.
Tom extended his hand toward me, but I pulled him in for a hug.
“Good to see you, Mitch,” he said.
“You too, Tom.”
“Honey, your mom and I are very excited about having the wedding here. We’ll make it exactly how
you want it. She’s waiting for you inside.”
“We have so much planning to do,” Charlie said, beaming at me.
Stunning. She looked overjoyed and back to the happy girl I adored. I could look at her beautiful face
forever and was thankful I’d get the chance. “I’ll see you two later.”
Once Charlie was inside, Tom grabbed onto my shoulder. “You know I couldn’t be happier that you’re
marrying my daughter, right? Joining our family?”
Tom had always made me feel so welcome. “Thanks, Tom. Charlie means everything to me and I
promise you I will do whatever it takes to make her happy.”
Tom nodded. “I know. You two are so fortunate to have found each other. When I think of who she
could have ended up with, I cringe.”
“That’s funny. We were just talking about Charlie’s ex last night.”
“Yeah, he came to mind when Tamera told me you and Charlie had moved up the date. I never liked
him. When Charlie dumped him and found you, I was so relieved,” Tom said, patting my shoulder.
“I’m the lucky one, Tom. Your daughter makes me a better man.”
“Women have a way of doing that. Tamera makes me better too. Let’s get started,” Tom said, as he
turned toward the garage. I followed him, knowing I needed the ladder to begin my light-removing quest.
Chapter Seven
CHARLIE
Mom and I had been inside discussing how we could arrange the backyard. She was making a list of
things we needed to rent and buy. Obviously, we needed chairs, tables, and all the necessities that go
along with having a wedding.
“Do you know what colors you want?” she asked me.
“I love the jewel tones. Maybe a rich purple or a deep green. I think I’ll know it when I see the
bridesmaids’ dresses.”
“Well, let’s go shopping tomorrow and see what we find. You can invite Kate and Natalie if you like.”
“Natalie and Mac are on their honeymoon, cruising to Hawaii, and Kate and Neil went to Santa
Barbara for a long weekend.”
“Oh, lucky them. Maybe when they get back. We’ll have to see them in the dresses you select. Let’s
make a day of it and go to lunch too. It’s been a while since we’ve gone out together, honey.”
“That sounds good, Mom,” I said, reaching for my mother’s hand. I gave it a light squeeze. “I’m gonna
make some iced tea for Daddy and Mitch.”
“I already have some chilling in the fridge.”
I smiled at my mother, who always seemed to be a step or two ahead of me. I made my way to the
kitchen and poured two glasses of iced tea. “I’ll be right back, Mom,” I said as I began walking out the
front door.
My heart stopped at what I saw, and I dropped both glasses. They shattered on the concrete walkway.
“Mitch!” I screamed, watching the ladder shifting beneath him. He threw his arms out to both sides,
trying to maintain his balance, but the ladder tilted away from the side of the house. I watched him fall in
what seemed like slow motion, an eternity passing before my eyes. Mitch landed hard on his back, and I
heard a loud cracking sound. “Daddy!” I yelled out. “Mitch fell.” I ran toward Mitch, praying to God he
was okay.
I knelt down beside him. “Mitch, talk to me.”
Mitch’s eyes met mine, but he didn’t speak. He also didn’t move. I touched his face. “Sweetie, I’m
here. It’s gonna be okay. Just…just try to breathe,” I gasped out.
I needed to tell myself to just breathe too. I was on the verge of freaking out, but I remained calm for
Mitch’s sake. His crystal blue eyes stayed locked on mine and I continued lightly stroking his face.
My dad ran out from the garage with a hammer in his hands. He dialed 911, told them what happened,
and then knelt down on the other side of Mitch.
I continued to look into the eyes of the man I loved. He mouthed I love you and then closed his eyes.
The moment they shut, a dam burst within me, my shoulders shook, and I couldn’t stop the emotions
flooding my body like a tidal wave. I felt for a pulse, relief surging through me when I felt his heart was
still beating.
“Dad, how long will the ambulance be?” I choked out.
“They’ll be here soon. What happened, honey?”
“I think he reached too far for the lights and he slipped. The next thing I knew he was falling.”
When the ambulance arrived, the paramedics quickly assessed the situation, but didn’t tell me anything.
I rode in the ambulance with Mitch, holding his hand, while my mom and dad followed behind. This isn’t
happening. It can’t be happening. But the blaring of the siren convinced me otherwise. Dread invaded
my body like a plague and all I wanted was for Mitch to be okay again. I didn’t know if that was truly a
possibility.
Once we were at the hospital, he was rushed behind closed doors and I wasn’t allowed to follow. I
felt like my life was being taken away, because it was. Mitch was my life. The thought of life without him
was unfathomable to me. Breathing in deeply, I attempted to calm down. But it was no use; I was too
scared of what might be happening to Mitch while I waited helplessly.
The nurse directed us to the waiting room and all we could do was sit. I was gripped with fear. Please
God, let him be okay.
So many things were going through my mind, but the one repeating visual was my beautiful man falling,
and nothing I could do to stop it. I had no idea what was going to happen when the doctor finally walked
out to talk to me. My insides were trembling and I thought I was going to heave.
My dad sat beside me, taking my hand. “Sweetheart, I’m so sorry. I should have paid a professional to
take down the lights.” His voice was shaky and I could tell he was doing everything in his power to
maintain his composure.
I shook my head. “Dad, it’s not your fault. Mitch wanted to help you. It’s just…just an accident,” I said,
bursting into tears. An accident that could change our lives forever. My dad put his arms around me,
consoling me while my mom tried to find out any information she could. But the nurse didn’t know
anything yet.
My mind wandered to the recent times I’d been right here in this waiting room. Some severe blows had
been dealt to my dear friend Natalie. I didn’t want to call her or Kate to let them know what was
happening. They both deserved a little peace in their lives after everything they’d each been through. But,
I knew if I didn’t call them, they’d be pissed to say the least. I’d have to think about that later.
But, I had to call Mitch’s family. All I managed to say on the phone to his mom was “accident” and the
hospital name. I could barely get the words out and she knew by my voice to get here immediately. Within
a short period of time, Mitch’s parents had arrived.
“What happened, Charlie? Where’s Mitch?” Lillian, Mitch’s mom, asked. His dad, Edward, just stood
there waiting for the answer. I knew telling them what happened wasn’t going to make her dislike me any
less.
“He was taking down Christmas lights and fell off the ladder,” I said, holding back the tears, bracing
myself for her wrath.
“What? Why was he doing that?”
“Mitch was helping out my dad, Lillian. It was an accident,” I said, wrapping my arms around myself
in a protective manner. I knew Lillian wasn’t very fond of me, but I didn’t know why.
Her glare said it all. “So, my son is in the hospital because of your dad? Your dad couldn’t take care of
it himself?”
My dad immediately intervened. “Lillian, I’m so sorry. I should have hired someone instead of
accepting Mitch’s offer to help.”
Lillian’s jaw clenched and her nostrils flared. “Sometimes, sorry isn’t good enough, Tom. I guess all
we can do now is wait.” Lillian and Edward turned and sat in the chairs across from us. So there we
were, waiting together, Mitch’s parents staring a hole through me. Well, Lillian mostly. Edward didn’t
seem to know where to look. The tension was palpable. I wanted to disappear from Lillian’s gaze, but I
couldn’t escape. I could only hope the doctor would be coming out any minute with good news.
Grief was beginning to settle into my bones, making everything ache. When was the doctor going to
appear? The longer it took, the worse I felt. My mind was spinning out of control with heartbreaking
scenarios.
Finally, the doctor walked into the waiting room.
“Doctor, I’m Lillian Hawkins. Is there any news about my son, Mitch Hawkins?” Lillian asked. I knew
she had to be beside herself with worry.
The doctor had a concerned look on his face. “I’m Dr. Grayson. You son is in the ICU. We had to
operate on his brain because he cracked his skull and his brain began swelling. The pressure has been
relieved and all we can do is see what happens in the next twenty-four hours.”
“What does that mean? Is he going to be okay?” I asked.
“A brain injury is very unpredictable. Right now, we don’t know exactly what the prognosis will be.
Not until Mitch wakes up.”
“Can we see him?” asked Edward.
“I think it’d be best if you all went home and came back to see Mitch in the morning. I’m hoping we’ll
be able to move him out of the ICU and into a hospital room tomorrow. He’s heavily sedated, so he won’t
be waking up tonight.”
“Thank you, Dr. Grayson,” Edward said. “Come, Lillian. Let’s go home.”
With that, Mitch’s parents turned and walked out, not even bothering to utter a goodbye. Dr. Grayson
had a puzzled look on his face, probably from their abrupt departure.
“Sweetheart, the doctor’s right. We should go home and come back in the morning,” my mom
suggested.
“Would you be able to leave each other here?” I asked, looking at both of my parents, already knowing
their answer.
My mom pulled me in for a hug. “No, we couldn’t leave each other or you, sweetheart.”
As our embrace ended, my dad touched my cheek. “If you want to come stay in your old bedroom
while Mitch is here, you’re more than welcome.”
“Thanks, Dad. I think I might take you up on that offer. I don’t want to be at home without Mitch.”
I turned to Dr. Grayson. “I know you said he won’t be awake, but you also said brain injuries are
unpredictable. Is there any way I can see him, talk to him?”
Dr. Grayson nodded reluctantly. “Hearing your voice would most likely be good for him. Follow me.”
I said goodnight to my parents and followed Dr. Grayson to the elevator. I couldn’t help but notice his
kind blue eyes that seemed to emanate so much empathy.
“So, have you and Mitch been together very long?” he asked, as the elevator doors opened.
“Seven years,” I said, looking up at him. “We met in college and recently got engaged.”
It was a short ride up to the ICU and Dr. Grayson led the way to Mitch. He didn’t look like himself,
lying there in a hospital bed, his head bandaged and an IV attached to his arm. My insides turned seeing
him in this condition. Mitch was my Superman, with the muscles, dark hair, and handsome face to prove
it.
I exhaled sharply, my mind replaying Mitch falling from the ladder and landing on the concrete below.
Dr. Grayson pulled me from the nightmare replaying in my mind.
“You’re welcome to stay with him for a little while, and then you can check in with the nurses’ station.
They can give you a pillow and blanket, but we really don’t have a place for you to sleep.”
“That’s okay. I don’t think I can sleep right now,” I said, staring at Mitch’s face.
“I understand. I’ll be back later.”
Dr. Grayson departed and I pulled the chair closer to Mitch. I picked up the rugged hand of the man I
loved. “Baby,” I said, kissing his hand. “Oh, I need you to wake up, Mitch. I need to look into your big
blue eyes and see your sexy smile.” I leaned toward him and gave him a kiss on the lips, hoping he was
like Sleeping Beauty and would awaken once my lips caressed his. But he didn’t. I was relieved he was
alive, but the not knowing if he’d be okay until he woke up was going to be hell. All I could do was talk
to him.
“Mitch, I love you so much. Watching you fall today was possibly one of the worst moments of my life.
I can’t imagine my life without you, baby, so I need you to wake up. I need you to come back to me.” I
scooted the chair closer and rested my head on his broad shoulder. A tear streamed down my face and
landed on his hospital gown. I didn’t know what else to do but stay as close to him as I possibly could,
hoping my presence would beckon to him, bring him out of his dormant state. He was the only man I’d
ever loved and I couldn’t imagine my life without him. He was sustenance to my heart and I’d be ripped
to shreds if he didn’t wake up.
I closed my eyes, and our first date began playing out in my mind. Mitch looked so handsome that night
and from the moment he picked me up, I wanted to kiss him. I needed to kiss him…
“You look so beautiful, Charlie,” he said, extending his hand to take mine.
“Thank you,” I replied, beaming. It was a warm September night and I was wearing my favorite
sundress and strappy sandals. Mitch was taking me for Thai food in Pacific Beach. I was looking
forward to holding his hand as we walked along the boardwalk. I had to admit to myself I was a little
scared to go out with him after my experience with Eric. Dating Eric at first had been wonderful, but
then everything changed. Hoping that didn’t happen with Mitch, I took a leap of faith. Kate and David
had assured me Mitch was a good guy and I had no reason not to believe them.
“So, tell me something about yourself. Anything,” Mitch said.
I thought for a second. “When I was a little girl, my parents took me to Sea World. We had passes,
so we went all the time. The day I got to help during Shamu’s show was probably the best day ever. For
a long time after that, I wanted to be a marine biologist and I seriously read every book I could get my
hands on about the ocean. I have all kinds of facts stored away about all kinds of sea animals.”
“So, are you gonna become a marine biologist?”
“No, by the time I got to high school, I’d outgrown the idea. I wanna work for a company in HR.”
Mitch had my hand in his by now. My heart was accelerating just being so close to him, and…
My body jolted and I thought for a split second Mitch had woken up. It was three in the morning, but
Mitch wasn’t awake. I could see his chest rising and falling, reassuring me he was okay. I readjusted
myself to be more comfortable, hoping to resume my dream of our first date. As I drifted off, my mind
brought me to our third Christmas together.
“What’s this for?” I asked as Mitch handed me a small, beautifully wrapped package.
“It’s the first day of Christmas and your true love has a gift for you,” he said with his mischievous
grin.
“What?”
“It’s twelve days before Christmas and I have something for you for each day.”
“Oh, Mitch. You’re the sweetest guy ever,” I said, hugging him. “This isn’t a partridge in a pear
tree, is it?”
Mitch chuckled. “No, baby. I used the idea of the song, but not the presents from the song.”
I beamed up at Mitch. “How did I get so lucky to have such an amazing boyfriend?”
“I’m the lucky one, baby. Don’t ever forget that. Now open your gift.”
I tore the paper off and opened the box. Inside was a lace, heart-shaped potpourri. I brought it to
my nose and inhaled deeply.
“I thought you could put that in your panty drawer,” he said, whispering in my ear.
“I love it so much. And I love you for being so romantic.”
“You make it easy to be romantic.”
I wrapped my arms around Mitch’s neck and began kissing him.
Mitch’s hand slightly moved in mine as I woke up. It was six in the morning and I’d slept next to him,
holding his hand, dreams dancing through my mind. Mitch moaned slightly. Elation coursed through my
body with the hope he’d be waking up. Yesterday had been the worst day of my life, but today there was
hope. Mitch was going to wake up any second. “Mitch, you’re the strongest person I know and because of
you, I’m strong too. Open your eyes, baby.”
As if he were following my commands, his eyes opened.
Chapter Eight
MITCH
I opened my eyes, but nothing was familiar as I strained to look around. My head felt like someone was
jackhammering it, making my vision slightly blurry. It took a couple of seconds for me to adapt to my
surroundings. Slowly glancing around the room, I quickly realized I was in the hospital. Someone, who I
presumed to be a nurse, was holding my hand and talking to me. I wasn’t sure why she was giving me so
much attention, but hopefully when Heather arrived this nurse would be gone. Heather had always been
the jealous type, and this nurse was way too gorgeous for Heather not to notice.
“Oh Mitch, you’re awake. Thank God,” she said, as she tried her best to hug me. Did I know this
woman? I couldn’t place her at all, and since she was so beautiful, I was surprised at myself for not
remembering meeting her before. No guy on the planet would forget this woman.
“Mitch, can you hear me? Can you talk?” she asked, with great concern in her eyes.
“Yes, and yes.”
She laughed. “You’re so cute, even in a hospital bed,” she said, lifting up my hand to kiss it.
Okay, this woman had my attention, and if I were single, I’d be interested even though she was older
than me. She sure seemed to like me.
“Did I get hurt playing football?” I asked her.
Her brow creased and she looked at me like she didn’t comprehend what I was asking.
“Do you know how I got hurt?” I asked.
“Oh, baby. You don’t remember,” she said, softly rubbing the back of her hand against my face. “You
fell off a ladder, taking down Christmas lights for my dad. You scared me to death. You had swelling on
your brain and they had to perform surgery to relieve the pressure.”
“That explains my headache,” I said. “Can I ask another question?”
“Anything.”
“Do we know each other?”
Her eyes grew wide and her smile faded away. “You don’t recognize me?”
“No, I don’t,” I said, slightly shaking my head. That was a mistake. The pain. I needed pain meds
ASAP.
“I’m your fiancée, Charlie. We’ve been together for the last seven years.”
“How’s that possible? I’m a senior in high school. My girlfriend’s name is Heather.”
Charlie’s eyes filled with tears and she covered her mouth with her hand. I wanted to comfort her, but
figured it wouldn’t be cool.
“I better get a nurse or doctor. I’ll be right back.”
I felt lost, waiting there for some woman who claimed to be my fiancée. Maybe she was a patient in
the hospital too and was just confused. I had no way of knowing until I could see Heather or my mom.
Maybe I was hallucinating the whole thing.
Where was my family? My girlfriend? Didn’t they know I was in the hospital? Why weren’t they here
right now? Nothing made any sense, but I was hoping the doctor could straighten things out.
I saw a pitcher of water and a cup on the nightstand next to me. I poured myself a cup of water and then
another. I was so parched, my insides felt shriveled up like a prune.
Charlie returned with a doctor. “Mitch, I’m Dr. Grayson. You were admitted yesterday after you fell
off a ladder. How are you feeling?”
“Honestly, I feel like a truck ran over my head. I’m not sure what’s going on.”
I looked over at Charlie. “Would it be possible for me to speak with the doctor alone?”
“Oh, of course. I’ll wait outside,” she said with a shaky voice. She was visibly upset and it seemed to
be because she thought she should be here. But she had said she was my fiancée, so that’d make sense.
“Let me ask you a few questions,” Dr. Grayson stated.
“Okay.”
“When is your birthday?”
“November 14, 1989.”
“How old are you?”
“Eighteen.”
“What year is it now?”
“2007. Doctor, what’s going on? Who’s that woman and why does she think she knows me?”
“Mitch, this is very common in brain injuries. You’re having some memory loss. You and Charlie are
engaged and it’s 2014.”
Holy shit. I rubbed my hands over my face. “That can’t be right, can it? I don’t remember the last seven
years? I need to see my parents.”
“I’ll have the nurse get ahold of them. I’m going to need to do some testing, but it can wait until after
you see your parents. I’ll also have the nurse give you some pain meds.”
“Okay, thanks Dr. Grayson. Do you have any idea how long it’ll take to get my memory back?”
“Unfortunately, I really don’t. The brain is very complicated, and there’s so much we don’t know about
it,” the doctor said. “We’ll get ahold of your parents and I’ll check back with you.”
The doctor left and I lay there in bed, wondering how any of this was possible. I needed to see my best
friend. Where the hell is he? David would be able to fill in all the missing pieces. We’d been best friends
forever and he knew everything about me. I just needed someone I recognized. Heather, Garrett, my mom.
Anyone.
Chapter Nine
CHARLIE
My heart was in my throat waiting for the doctor to come out of Mitch’s room. Mitch not remembering
me was quite a shock.
“Dr. Grayson, what’s going on? Why doesn’t Mitch remember me?”
“Mitch has short-term memory loss. He thinks it’s 2007.”
Hearing that news caused me to lose my balance and I began falling toward the wall. Dr. Grayson
reached out and grabbed me.
“You better sit down. Nurse, can we get some water over here?”
“Right away, Dr. Grayson.”
Dr. Grayson sat beside me with his hand on my wrist. “Charlie, you need to relax.”
“Is he going to remember?”
Dr. Grayson didn’t say anything. He just looked at me with his empathetic eyes.
“Will he?” I asked again with more urgency.
“There’s no way to know if he’ll remember or not.”
I couldn’t stop the tears, even though I didn’t want to cry in front of the doctor. The nurse brought me
water and Dr. Grayson asked her to get ahold of Mitch’s parents. All of this was happening right in front
of me, but nothing seemed real. I kept expecting to wake up from one of those dreams that can’t be
explained because it’s too weird.
“You look like you could use some food. I was planning on getting some coffee. Why don’t you come
with me to the cafeteria? It may help.”
I nodded. “Thank you. Coffee sounds really good.”
Walking through the cafeteria line, I looked at the food options, but nothing was appetizing. I got a
yogurt, thinking at least it’d be a little something. What I really needed was the coffee. It was going to be a
long day.
Dr. Grayson and I sat at a table. “So, how did you and Mitch meet?” he inquired.
“We met in college. We’ve been together ever since. We’re getting married next month,” I said, the
whole time fighting the urge to put my head on the table and cry until there was no more water left in my
body.
“Well, sometimes memory loss is just temporary…a few days, and then the patient regains their
memories. I’ll run some tests on Mitch and see if I can come up with anything more conclusive.”
While the doctor was finishing his statement, his phone lit up. “I have to go. I’m sure I’ll see you
later,” he said with a nod. He was more compassionate than I’d expected, and knowing he was Mitch’s
doctor reassured me everything was going to be all right.
I drank my coffee, but it didn’t help. I felt exhausted all the way in my bones and every movement was
heavy and awkward. Sleeping for a week didn’t seem like enough time to alleviate my tiredness. What if
he never remembers? That thought made me want to curl up in the fetal position, but I knew now was the
time to fight…fight for the man I love. Lillian would be taking full advantage of this situation and doing
everything in her power to turn Mitch against me.
One day. One day was possibly changing the course of my life. Yesterday morning, we lounged
together in bed, wrapped in each other’s arms. Not a care in the world. Fast forward twenty-four hours
and all I had were cares. I needed Mitch to remember me. He needed to remember me. My coffee became
lukewarm and I knew it was time to get back to him. I wanted to be there before his mother had too much
time alone with him. Making my way back to his room, I realized I was too late. She was already there,
sitting beside him on his bed. He was explaining to her that he was confused about waking up to a woman
he didn’t know. So, he remembered his mother, but not me. Where are my best friends when I need them?
But I had no intentions of interrupting their getaways with their husbands. Both Kate and Natalie would be
home soon enough, but I desperately wished they were here.
Entering the hospital room, I felt a chill in the air. Lillian glared back at me, but I didn’t let her faze
me.
“Charlie, I’d like to speak with you outside for a moment,” Lillian commanded. I followed her into the
hall, preparing myself for a nasty exchange.
“The nurse called us to let us know Mitch was awake. When I arrived, I found out he’s having some
memory issues. I think it’d be best if you gave him some space. He doesn’t need you here confusing him.”
“Confusing him? Lillian, I’m his fiancée. We’re getting married and he needs to see me in order to
remember. Your son loves me and I love him. Please don’t do this.”
“That may be, but he doesn’t remember. Your presence is only going to trouble him. I’ll have you
barred from his room if I have to. You’re not family. But I’d prefer if you could just follow my wishes. I
am his mother.”
There were a thousand different things I wanted to say to her—no, actually scream at her—but I knew
none of them would do any good. “Okay, Lillian. I’ll give Mitch some space. He needs to rest anyway
after all the trauma he’s been through.”
“Yes, he does need his rest, and I’m going to make sure he gets it.”
I couldn’t say another word to her. I simply nodded and began walking away. She returned to Mitch’s
room.
I didn’t know why, but shed disliked me from the moment we met. She was always civil in front of
Mitch, but her disdain emanated from her body language. It wasn’t as bad when we were dating, but as
soon as our relationship became serious, her resentment toward me grew. The only thing I could surmise
was Mitch had been an emotional husband to her and she viewed me as someone who was taking him
away. At least, that’s what I thought. But if I were right about that, why would she love Heather so much?
She brought up Heather every chance she got, telling me what a great girlfriend she’d been. Of course, this
was never in front of Mitch. Surely she wouldn’t try and bring Heather into Mitch’s life like this now?
Hasn’t she moved on? It’s been seven years. This is awful. How am I going to stay away? Can she really
bar me from his room? I am his family. I’m his fiancée.
I called my dad to come pick me up, since I came in the ambulance and didn’t have a way home.
Glancing over at the nurses’ station, I recognized the nurse. “Michelle?”
“Yes. We’ve met before, right?” she replied, extending her hand to shake mine.
“Yeah, I’m Charlie. We met through Kate. It was a couple of months ago.”
“Oh, that’s right. You were all at the hospital when that young woman died.”
“Yes, Natalie’s sister.”
“I just started my shift, but I couldn’t help but overhear your conversation just now. Are you okay? Do
you want to talk about it?”
I told Michelle what had transpired since last night and what I discovered when Mitch woke up.
“Well, his memory loss could just be temporary. Once his brain’s had a chance to do some healing and
process everything, it’ll most likely be okay.”
“Thank you, Michelle. Since Mitch’s mother has asked me to leave, would you call me if there are any
changes or if something important happens?”
“Sure. Give me your number,” she said, as she took out her cell phone.
I gave her my number and she saved it in her phone. We said our goodbyes, and I left. I waited out front
for my dad, who’d be arriving momentarily. Leaving Mitch at the hospital felt so foreign, like I’d entered
an alternate universe where nothing made sense. Staying at our townhouse right now was more than I
could handle, so I was going to stay with my parents.
Both my parents were in the car coming to pick me up. “Sweetheart, you look exhausted. Why don’t
you lie down in the backseat and we can talk when we get to the house?” my mother suggested. I was
more than happy to follow her instructions; my eyelids felt like bricks were weighing them down.
We arrived home, went inside, and then my mother asked, “How’s Mitch doing?”
“Mitch is…Mitch is all right. He woke up, but has lost his memory,” I said, my eyes filling with tears.
Tears I couldn’t hold back any longer.
“He has amnesia?” my dad asked, concern creasing his brow.
The words were stuck in my throat and I couldn’t get them out, so I just nodded. My head throbbed and
all the air was sucked out of my lungs. I took in several deep breaths.
“Honey, sit down,” my mother said, then wrapped her arms around me. Oh how I needed her arms at
that moment. After a few minutes, she said she’d get me something to eat and went to the kitchen.
My dad, who sat next to me on the sofa, wrapped me in his arms, his familiar scent a balm for my
aching heart. I leaned into him and sobbed quietly.
My mom returned with water and toast. “Here, honey. You need to eat a little something and rest for a
while. You look exhausted and you won’t do Mitch any good if you get sick yourself.”
My mom was always the practical one and my dad, the big teddy bear. I did what my mother told me to
do, knowing she was right, even though all I wanted was to be at the hospital with Mitch.
Chapter Ten
MITCH
“Mom, who was the woman that just left? She said she was my fiancée.”
“You don’t need to worry about her right now. You just need to concentrate on getting better.”
How can my mom say I don’t need to worry about the fact I’m engaged? Surreal. “This is so weird
knowing I’m actually twenty-five, but having no memory of the last seven years. I feel bad I don’t know
my own fiancée. Is she coming back? I need her to fill me in on some things.”
“Charlie and I discussed the situation. We agreed you need a little time. She’s going to let you rest and
I can fill in some missing pieces for you.”
The only woman that registered in my life was Heather. But it had been seven years. Surely my mom
hadn’t kept in contact with Heather, but I felt compelled to ask.
“Do you still talk to Heather? Have you let Heather know I’m in the hospital? Is she coming to see
me?”
“Yes. Heather will be here soon.”
Hearing that made me relax a little, but I didn’t know why. Surely Mom would believe I’d need
Charlie around me, yet she sent for Heather? “Mom, I’m not exactly sure what happened. Charlie said I
fell off a ladder. Is that how I ended up in here?”
“Yes. You hit your head on the concrete. Your brain swelled and they had to do surgery to relieve the
pressure. But everything’s going to be okay now.”
“That’s what Charlie told me. Do you know when Charlie is coming back? I don’t want her to be here
when Heather gets here.”
“You don’t need to worry about Charlie or anything else. You know me—I’ve got everything under
control. I’ll handle everything. You need to rest and I’m going to track down your doctor and find out
more. Your father should be here soon. When I left the house, he was talking to your brother.”
“Why aren’t they here yet?”
My mom put her hand to her heart, like she was too choked up to tell me. She stayed quiet for a moment
and I began to think something else was very wrong.
“Your brother lives in New York. He’s booked a flight and will be here in a few hours.”
“What? When did Garrett move to New York? Why would you let him do that?”
“Mitch, it’s been seven years. After graduating college, he took a job in New York. Being a busy
architect, he doesn’t come home very much.”
I wanted to shut my eyes and have them open to the reality everyone else was living, because I had
entered some alternate universe. Seven years. Shit. All I could do was stare at my mom blankly. My older
brother moved across the country. It made no sense to me. He’d always been my best friend, except for
David. My mom squeezed my hand and then got up to find my doctor. All I wanted was to get the hell out
of here, but the last thing I remember was going to prom with Heather, Kate, and David. Hopefully, my
mom called David and he could help me make sense of it all.
Before my mom returned, Heather walked through the door. Recognizing someone other than my mom
was a huge relief. She was tall with long auburn hair that had a slight wave to it. Her piercing blue eyes
locked onto mine. She was breathtaking with her alabaster skin and goddess-like body. Having her here
both calmed me and revved me up at the same time. She was more beautiful than I remembered. She’d
grown into her own and filled out a little more. She was a woman.
“Heather, I’m so glad you’re here,” I said, leaning forward with my arms stretched. She didn’t say
anything. She sat on the bed, melted into my arms, and began to cry. “Don’t cry. I’m okay,” I said, stroking
the back of her hair.
“Mitch, I’m so glad to see you. I…I’ve missed you so much.”
“We haven’t been together for the last seven years, huh?”
“No. We broke up the summer before college,” she murmured.
Heather pulled back so I could look into her eyes. She put her hand on my face. “You’ve always
remained in my heart even though I went out with other people and you settled into a relationship with
Charlie.”
“So, do you know Charlie?”
“I’ve never officially met her. Your mom and I have kept in touch over the years. She’s kept me in the
loop.”
I leaned into her hand. It felt familiar. She said I’d been going out with Charlie for seven years. I’m
engaged to her. But, I can’t imagine anyone but Heather in my heart. Surely I must love Charlie, but right
now, all I know is my love for Heather. If I’m engaged to someone else, what about her?
“Heather, are you in a relationship with someone else too?”
“Mitch, no. I haven’t stopped loving you. I never will.”
I pulled her into my arms again, and the heat from her body soothed mine.
My mom returned. “Heather, I’m so glad you’re here.”
Heather got up to hug my mom. “Thank you for calling me.”
“Of course, honey. Mitch was asking for you and I just knew he needed to see you, be with you.”
“I can’t believe we lost seven years,” I said, looking at Heather. She smiled at me shyly.
“Mom, what did the doctor say?”
“He’s ordered a CT scan to see if there is any damage to your brain and make sure there aren’t any
other complications.”
“Does he have any idea when I’ll get my memory back?”
“It’ll happen when your brain’s ready to remember. No one has any idea when or if that’ll happen.”
“You mean…I may never get back my memory of the last seven years?”
My mom shrugged. “No one knows.”
I nodded, but didn’t ask any more questions. My mom and Heather talked to each other in hushed tones
while I tried to absorb the shocking news. I may never remember my life. It might be lost to me forever. I
sunk a little into my bed. The realization of losing this part of my life forever was crashing over me and I
felt like I was lost at sea in a storm. Yesterday, Heather and I were broken up and I was engaged to
Charlie. My brother had moved across the country. My mom didn’t seem to like Charlie, but sure was
cozy with Heather. If I felt this strongly toward Heather, why did I break up with her? Why would my
mom not like someone I was engaged to? That didn’t make sense. Physically, I know I’m attracted to
Heather—who wouldn’t be?
David. I needed to talk to David.
Chapter Eleven
CHARLIE
Feeling startled, I sat up in bed. Beads of sweat had formed on my brow, and I pulled my knees to my
chest, wrapping my arms around them. Feeling a little disoriented at first, I began making out shapes,
realizing I was sleeping in my childhood bedroom. The drapes were thick, so very little sunlight entered
in. Being here was strange when I should have been with Mitch, his strong arms wrapped around me.
I’d been dreaming, or I should say nightmaring, but that’s not a word. It was about Eric and how he’d
been so wonderful in the beginning, but had become controlling as our relationship grew. He found a way
to alienate me from my friends and became angry if another guy noticed me. I began to really clue in when
he started buying me clothes. Things I’d never wear, because they were just God-awful, matronly. He
wanted me to behave a certain way in public and another way in private. His control was like a noose
around my neck and I was worried he’d snap and hurt me. Why on earth was I thinking about Eric again
after all these years? Was it because of Mitch’s accident?
I don’t know what I would’ve done if I hadn’t met Mitch, and I never wanted to find out. He not only
stopped Eric the day I broke up with him, he stopped Eric period. Eric was afraid of Mitch and even
though he attempted to intimidate me from a distance, he was never again up close and personal. The last
time I saw him, thankfully, was at graduation. Fortunately, San Diego was a large enough city that running
into Eric was extremely unlikely.
Figuring out a way to make Mitch remember me was at the top of my list of priorities. I thought for a
moment. Before returning to the hospital, I was going to make a stop at our townhouse and find some
things to show him our life together.
I got up and clicked on a light. It was eleven in the morning. I’d been sleeping for a couple of hours.
Getting home so I could shower and change was the next thing I needed to do.
I entered the kitchen to get a glass of water and found a note on the refrigerator. My parents had gone to
church. They wrote they’d be praying for Mitch. Church. I hadn’t been there in a long time. Maybe I’d go
with them next Sunday. I needed as much prayer for what was happening as I could get.
I wrote under the note my parents had left for me so they’d know I went home and then to the hospital.
Driving home, my stomach was in knots wondering if by some miracle Mitch had recovered his
memory. When he asked me who I was, it felt like a knockout punch and I wasn’t sure if I was going to be
able to breathe again. Had he really lost the last seven years? How was that even possible? It just
couldn’t be. He had to remember me. I was going to be his wife.
Knowing Lillian could prevent me from seeing Mitch since I wasn’t his wife, I had to be prepared for
anything. I really hoped it wouldn’t come to that, but ultimately, she was in control and there was nothing I
could do about it.
I found a box in the garage when I pulled up. It was sturdy and the right size for me to put framed
pictures of us. Dear God, please let this jog his memory.
Searching through the cards and letters he’d given me over the years, I selected a sampling for him to
read. Maybe these would bring back his memories or at least demonstrate for him that we’re in love.
Once I had found everything I needed, I took a shower and got ready to return to the hospital. Anxiety
gripped me, as I didn’t know what to expect when I arrived. With Lillian in charge, it wasn’t going to be
pleasant or easy.
Walking into Mitch’s room, I was happy to see his dad sitting there with him. We weren’t exactly
bosom buddies, but he was always cordial, never exuding disdain like Lillian. Edward was stoic and
seemed to be watching over Mitch. I’d never seen him so connected to his son as he was in this moment. I
hated to interrupt their private time even though Mitch’s eyes were closed.
“Hi, Edward,” I said softly
He turned and looked at me. “Charlie.”
“Is Lillian around?” I inquired.
“When Mitch fell asleep, she and Heather went to the cafeteria to get some coffee. They should be
back in a few minutes.” Already? Lillian had organized Heather to come already? I think I might be sick.
“How is Mitch feeling?”
“His head hurts and he’s confused. He thinks Heather is his girlfriend and Lillian is going to do
everything in her power to keep those two together. She has some attachment to Heather I’ve never
understood.”
I exhaled sharply. Wow. I didn’t expect that. Interesting that Edward can see what’s going on here. “Oh,
Edward. How could she? Mitch is my world.” He looked uncomfortable, so I brought the conversation
back to neutral territory. “Any update from the doctor?”
“They’re going to do a CT scan, but other than that they just want him to rest. They have no idea if he’s
going to remember anything.”
My heart sank. What if Mitch never remembered me? I don’t think I could endure losing him, I thought,
as I played with my engagement ring on my hand.
“I’m hoping when Garrett gets here he’ll be able to help Mitch with some memories. Mitch doesn’t
remember what happened to David, so we’re trying not to mention him.”
“I understand. Maybe Kate should be the one to tell Mitch when she returns from her trip. She and
Mitch have always been close.”
Edward nodded. He truly was a man of few words and he’d probably used up his quota for the day just
talking to me.
Mitch began to stir and his gorgeous eyes fixated on mine as soon as he was fully alert. The only thing I
wanted in the entire world was to see some recognition when he looked at me, but I could tell my face
didn’t register.
Chapter Twelve
MITCH
There she was again, the beautiful woman who claimed to be my fiancée. Well, obviously it was more
than a claim; I just couldn’t remember having asked her. I wish I could have, but the only face that kept
coming back to me was Heather’s.
She had a box in her hands and I wondered what she was going to show me. Maybe something that’d
help my memory and end this nightmare.
“Hi Mitch,” she said, love emanating from her face. “How are you feeling?”
“As good as can be expected. Dad, could you give us a few minutes? Keep Mom out too.”
“I’ll do my best, but you know your mother.”
I nodded as my dad stood up and left the room. I didn’t know how he’d managed my mother all these
years…Well, I guess it was more like survived.
“Please sit,” I said to Charlie, motioning to the chair next to the bed.
“I brought some things from home. I was hoping…maybe they’d help.”
“Yeah, show me,” I said, nodding slightly.
Charlie took out a framed picture of us together at the beach. We looked happy together. She handed me
another picture of us in formal attire—must have been from a wedding. Then another picture of me
proposing to her, actually slipping the ring on her finger. The look on her face was of pure joy. I stared at
these pictures, but nothing registered. I’m sure she had hope of me having a revelation, but nothing.
Nothing was familiar. Not remembering was so frustrating. I just sat there staring at a life I had no
recognition of, feeling like an idiot. All I could remember had nothing to do with her.
“Does anything jog your memory?” she asked, hope resonating in her voice.
“I wish I could say yes, but I don’t remember any of this.”
Charlie looked down. I knew she must be hurting. I couldn’t imagine if Heather didn’t remember me.
Charlie took a letter out of her box and handed it to me.
“You gave me this letter for my birthday. We’d been together for about six months.”
I read the letter, recognizing my own handwriting, reading my words of love and devotion. She really
meant something to me. I never gave Heather a letter like this. I usually got a card and just signed it.
Sadly, my own words didn’t seem to unlock my memories, either. But this definitely confirmed that I
loved this woman deeply. This was so confusing.
When I was done, I looked at Charlie. Her eyes were filled with expectation, but all I could do was
slightly shake my head.
Charlie took out her phone and brought up the video of me proposing to her on Thanksgiving at her
parents’ house. Every second was accounted for, from me delivering a plate of dessert to her with a silver
covering, to her lifting it up and finding the ring box. Watching myself get down on one knee, telling her
how important she was to me, and asking her to be my wife should have meant something to me. I watched
intently and wanted to slam the wall. I was so angry I couldn’t remember these special moments she’d
brought to me. Falling in love with her would’ve been easy. She was sweet, gentle, kind, sexy. I can’t
imagine how she must feel.
She started to open her mouth, but she could tell by the look on my face her effort had been useless.
“Would you like to keep these in case you wanna look at them later?”
“Yeah, I’ll keep them in the nightstand drawer. I’d hate for anything to happen to them.”
Before anything else could be said, my mom stormed into the room looking like she could slap Charlie
right out of this hospital.
“I told you he needed some time. He’s confused and doesn’t need you filling his head with your
memories of what you think your life was together. He. Doesn’t. Remember.”
“Mom, I’m glad she’s here. I’ve lost seven years and Charlie knows everything about that time in my
life. I want my memory back.”
My mom seemed to calm down, but she was still pushy and demanding. “Well, Heather has come to
see you and you do remember her. So perhaps Charlie can come back at another time, after you’ve been
able to rest.” The intense glare my mom shot Charlie made me feel uncomfortable, so I could only imagine
how Charlie was feeling.
“I can come back later, Lillian. Not a problem.” Charlie turned toward Heather, extending her hand.
“Hi, I’m Charlie, Mitch’s fiancée. It’s nice to meet you, Heather.”
“Nice to meet you too,” Heather managed. She was clearly feeling awkward as well.
“Mitch, I’ll check in with you later,” Charlie said, making her way toward the door.
“Okay, Charlie,” I called back to her.
As soon as she crossed the threshold of the door, my mom started in. “Mitch, you need to focus on what
you know. Heather is what you know. You two were good together and can be again,” my mom said,
bringing Heather’s hand to mine. “I’ll let you two have some time together.”
I had to admit my feelings were torn. My gut was screaming I should have asked my mom and Heather
to leave, and begged Charlie to stay. She’d been in my life for the last seven years. I’d moved on from
Heather. Charlie was kind and gentle, and could have let my mom have it, but she took the high road
instead. A quality I knew was rare and one I admired. Yet, Heather was here. Why was she here? After so
many years? Why? Yet, to me, my heart said Heather was my current love. As I turned to her, although I
felt so confused, it was her I knew.
“So, that was uncomfortable,” Heather said.
“Yeah, my mom was pretty forceful about Charlie leaving.”
“Well, I’m glad she did so we can be alone. I’ve missed you so much.”
“I’d say the same, but I feel like I just saw you yesterday,” I said, taking her hand. Heather sat on the
bed next to me.
“Come here,” I said, tugging her body toward mine. Heather nestled into me, her head resting on my
chest. This was a feeling I remembered and didn’t want to let go of.
Chapter Thirteen
CHARLIE
I couldn’t help but hear Lillian’s words, but I knew she wanted her words to echo in my ears. Knowing
why she disliked me so much would’ve made things easier, but I could never get a straight answer about
it. Mitch said not to worry about it, Lillian just clammed up when I attempted to talk to her, and I didn’t
even bother to ask Edward. He wasn’t going to say even if he knew.
I leaned against the wall for a moment, regaining my composure. I had felt hope, especially when I
showed Mitch his proposal—the most special day of our lives. But, his vacant look said it all. Nothing.
He remembered nothing. Despair cut through me and I wanted to slide down the wall and crumple into a
heap on the floor. How was I going to make Mitch remember me if I couldn’t spend more than a few
minutes with him?
I looked at my watch and decided to head back to my parents’. I had packed a bag while I was finding
memorabilia to show Mitch. Staying with my folks for the next few days would be comforting and I
needed them more than ever. There was no way I was disturbing my two best friends on their trips.
They’d probably be mad at me for not texting them right away, but they’d know soon enough. They both
deserved their alone time with their new husbands. But, how I missed Kate right now. I needed her.
Kate and Neil’s whirlwind romance had more than a few bumps on the road to happiness. They’d been
through more in the last few months than most couples face in years of marriage. Neil was her knight in
shining armor and had made everything in her world good again, after years of being shattered.
I saw Michelle at the nurses’ station and walked over to ask her a huge favor.
“Hi, Charlie. Any news on Mitch?”
“No. Everything is still the same.”
Michelle sized me up pretty quickly. “I’ll call you when he’s alone, so you can come back and have
some time with him. I’m so sorry you’re going through all of this.”
“Thank you, Michelle. I’d be so grateful to come here when he’s alone. But between his mother and
high school girlfriend, Heather, it might be a while before I can see him.”
“I wish there was something I could do or say to make things better. I understand what it’s like to have
your future mother-in-law dislike you. I was in a similar situation with my college boyfriend’s mother.”
“I guess moms are very protective of their sons. But, she seems to love Mitch’s old girlfriend, Heather.
I don’t know. I can’t waste time figuring her out. I need to concentrate on Mitch. I feel like I’ve already
lost him,” I said, putting my hand to my forehead. “I don’t know what I’m gonna do if his memory doesn’t
come back.”
“Try to stay positive. The body has a way of healing itself. Mitch is young and strong. I really think his
memories will return in time.”
“I hope so, but in the meantime, he’s looking at another woman with love in his eyes. They were high
school sweethearts. He’s never really opened up about why they broke up. But, he dumped her, and I’m
pretty sure she wants him back.”
Another woman walked up to ask Michelle questions about her husband. I made a slight waving
gesture toward Michelle and headed to the elevator. Hanging around here was pointless.
Driving home, I had thought about calling in sick for work, but keeping busy would be better than
wondering what was going on at the hospital. Lillian didn’t work, so she’d be able to spend all day at the
hospital if she wanted to.
I parked the car, but didn’t get out. I lowered my head to the steering wheel and began to sob. I hated
what was happening. We’d just planned on being married in a few weeks, and now another woman was in
Mitch’s arms. He was loving her, touching her, probably kissing her. Those thoughts ravaged my brain
and left my head spinning. Comprehending all that was going on was more than I could take. But, I needed
to regain my composure. I was a grown woman and I needed to remain strong if I was going to get my man
back.
Chapter Fourteen
MITCH
Heather had spent most of the afternoon and early evening with me. It was weird to hear about her life,
her career. The hole in my life skewed everything, and I’d been left behind by her emotionally. She’d
grown into a woman and I had to bridge the gap between the current Heather and the girl I knew in high
school.
As evening approached, Heather had to leave. She had work early in the morning, but promised to be
back tomorrow. I didn’t want her to go. I needed the familiar feeling…memories she could provide.
“Come here. Let me just hug you one more time.” I pulled her into the bed with me and she rested her
head against my chest. I needed her body to be close to mine. This I remembered. This I could feel.
Heather put her head back and looked into my eyes.
“Mitch—”
I didn’t let her finish. I pulled her head toward mine and we began kissing. As my tongue swirled with
hers, I remembered making love to her, the sensation of her body connected to mine. I wanted that
sensation again.
“Heather,” I breathed between kisses. “I want you so badly right now.”
“I want you too,” she said, her hand gliding down my chest and over my abs.
The feeling of her hands on me sent sparks throughout my body. I pulled her on top of me, knowing she
could feel what her body had done to mine. She let out a slight moan as she grinded against me. I knew
she was ready, her scent wafting up to caress my nose. I wanted my tongue between her legs. I wanted my
hands everywhere. My hand found its way to cup her breast and the urge to lift her top and lick her
nipples was becoming more than I could take. Suddenly, she pulled back.
“Mitch, I’m a little nervous someone could walk in on us. I’d prefer we be in private, being together as
long as we want, without interruptions.”
I let out a breath. “You’re right. I’ll be out of here soon and we can take our time.”
No sooner had Heather gotten her feet on the floor than my brother came into the room. I was so
grateful she had the good sense to stop. That would’ve been completely embarrassing.
“Bro, I heard you moved to New York. I’m so glad to see you. Thanks for flying out so fast.”
“I came as soon as I could. Mom called me when she left the hospital last night,” Garrett said, reaching
out to shake my hand. The handshake seemed so formal. I was taken aback a little.
“You remember Heather, right?”
“Of course. Heather. It’s good to see you.” Garrett’s expression was confusing. He looked relieved to
see me, but very surprised to see Heather.
“You too, Garrett. Well, I better get going. Mitch, I’ll see you tomorrow,” she said, kissing me softly on
the lips.
Garrett sat in the chair next to my bed. “When mom called and said there’d been an accident…” He
was too choked up to finish his thought.
“Bro, I’m just glad you’re here. Really glad,” I said, reaching out to pat my brother on the hand.
He exhaled sharply. “I haven’t been home for a while.”
“Yeah, Mom told me today. I can’t remember you moving away, so it was quite a shock. How’s New
York? I’ve made it there to visit you, right?”
“No. We haven’t seen each other since I left.”
What Garrett was saying didn’t make sense. How could we not see each other? All I could say was,
“Why?”
“It’s complicated. I’d prefer we talk about it when you’ve regained your memory. It’ll make it easier.”
He wasn’t making any sense, but I wasn’t in the mood to drag it out of him. I was so tired. Maybe when
I finally saw David, he could enlighten me.
“All right. Can you do me a favor, though? Get in touch with David. I don’t think Mom has called him.”
Garrett sighed and looked toward the floor. I could tell he was searching for something to say. Waiting
for him to answer me was becoming infuriating.
“Am I not friends with David anymore? Just tell me,” I said gruffly.
“I hate to be the one to tell you this, but David died in a car accident over three years ago.”
“What the hell are you talking about? What happened?”
“He was on his way to meet Kate, lost control of the car, and crashed. He was killed instantly.”
What? David’s gone? Shit. Shit. What? I rubbed my hands over my face, wondering what other bombs
were going to be dropped on me during my memory sabbatical.
“I can’t believe he’s gone.”
“I know. It was a terrible tragedy.”
“This is such bullshit. I hate this,” I growled.
“Well, I’m sure Charlie isn’t exactly loving this. You’ve forgotten her and you’re hooking up with your
ex. Seriously, bro, that was a kiss I witnessed, right? You’re engaged to another woman. You can’t just
dump her.”
“I’m not feeling up to explaining myself to you, bro. It doesn’t seem like we’re exactly close anymore.”
Now I was pissed. He had a lot of nerve judging me. How dare he come in here, not explain why he and I
hadn’t seen each other in years, and casually mention my best friend was dead? This was too much.
A deafening silence fell over the room. My brother and I had always been so tight, but that was gone.
What we had now was awkward. When did that happen and why?
Before I said anything I’d regret, I decided it was time to have him leave. “I appreciate you coming to
the hospital tonight, but I think I need to get some sleep. How long are you gonna be in town?”
“I have a couple weeks of vacation coming to me, so I’ll be around.”
“Okay. I’ll see you tomorrow?”
“I’ll be here.”
“Good. I’m gonna need your help, bro,” I said, looking my brother in the eyes. He seemed so distant
from me. What the fuck is happening? It was as if we both felt…angry, and the last thing I wanted was to
be at odds with him.
Garrett nodded and made his way to the door. He turned back and said, “It’s good to see you. I hope
your memory comes back quickly.”
He left and I lay there wondering what’d just happened. The blows kept coming, making me feel like a
punching bag. How am I going to get through this without David?
Chapter Fifteen
CHARLIE
Michelle had called to let me know Heather had left so I could come back and see Mitch before he
went to sleep. I knew Lillian wasn’t a night person and turned in early, so she wouldn’t be in my way. As
I stepped out of the elevator, I practically walked right into Garrett.
“Oh Garrett, you’re here,” I said, hugging him. Relief swept over me, knowing he’d help Mitch
recover his memory.
“Yes, Charlie, I’m here,” he said, holding me tight.
He held me in the hallway for a long moment, his muscular frame encasing my body. He kept telling me
in my ear how sorry he was Mitch and I were going through all of this. When he finally let go, I looked up
into his dark eyes.
“It’s been so long. Mitch and I have missed you.”
“I’ve missed you too.”
“Is Mitch still awake?”
“Yeah, I just left him.”
“So, he’s alone?”
Garrett nodded. He and Mitch were a year apart, but they almost seemed like twins; they looked so
much alike and carried themselves in a similar fashion.
“Well, I better get in there before he’s asleep.”
“Okay. I can hang out for a little while and we can get a cup of coffee after.”
“Are you sure? You’re probably tired from traveling.”
“Not really. I’m a night owl.”
“Okay, great. We have so much to catch up on. I wanna hear all about your life in New York,” I said,
touching his arm. “I’ll see you in a few.”
As I made my way toward Mitch’s room, a nurse stopped me to ask whom I was visiting.
“I’m going to see Mitch Hawkins.”
“What’s your name?”
“Charlie Andrews,” I replied, feeling the blood drain from my face as the nurse checked a list.
“I’m sorry, but Mrs. Hawkins has given a list of people who can see Mitch, and you’re not on the list,
sweetie.”
My heart sank. Her threat of barring me from Mitch’s room had become a reality. I wanted to scream at
the top of my lungs, but I managed to contain myself. “Are you sure I’m not on it?”
“Yes dear, I’m sure,” she said. “Perhaps you can talk to Mrs. Hawkins in the morning and get this
straightened out. It’s probably an oversight.”
“Thank you,” I said. If I could have curled up into a ball, I would’ve. The knockout punches kept
coming and Mitch’s mom had quite the left hook. She had beaten me hands down, and there was nothing I
could do about it.
Garrett was standing near me, shaking his head. “That’s Mom for you. She’s gonna take full advantage
of being in control.”
“Looks like we can get that coffee now,” I said, willing myself to keep the tears back.
“I think I remember a Starbucks nearby.”
“I know exactly where it is. Do you wanna follow me there?”
“Yeah, it’s been a while. I might get lost,” Garrett said, with a chuckle.
Driving over, I allowed myself to cry. I even screamed in the car to release some of the anger I was
feeling. Lillian was just cruel and I had no idea what was going to happen. At least Mitch had the pictures
I’d brought. All I could do was pray he’d come back to me. Heather was attractive. But she knew he was
engaged to me. Surely she wouldn’t want to come between Mitch and me?
Walking into the Starbucks, the aroma of coffee gave me some solace. Garrett was right behind me. As
we ordered our drinks, I couldn’t help but notice the girl behind the counter eying Garrett. He was a really
good-looking man and had such a sincere way about himself. I was looking forward to hearing all about
his life in New York and the gorgeous girlfriend he probably had.
We made our way to the sitting area they had set up like a living room, with overstuffed comfy chairs
and a sofa, while our drinks were being made.
“How are you holding up?” Garrett asked.
“Well, I was better when I thought I could visit my fiancé. Now I don’t know what to do.”
“I’ll talk to my mom about it tomorrow. She’s way out of line.”
“Thanks. I can’t believe she doesn’t want Mitch to remember his life. This is a complete nightmare,” I
said, closing my eyes briefly, wishing everything would be back to normal when I opened them.
“Our mother has been known to be controlling,” Garrett said, as he got up to retrieve our drinks.
He handed me my soy chai latte and sat next to me on the sofa. Holding it, smelling it, sipping it, was
like a warm blanket covering me. I let out a slight moan as I took a sip.
Garrett was staring at me intently. “Good?” he asked with raised eyebrows.
“Yes, it is. Just what I needed,” I said, my voice trembling. I couldn’t hold back the tears any longer.
I looked at Garrett, who had always been so wonderful to me. He put his hand on mine and said, “You
don’t have to be strong right now. Not with me.”
With those words, I let go and found myself in his arms. For a split second, it felt like Mitch was
holding me and I sank into him, pressing my body against his. Garrett stroked my hair, as we sat like we
were in our own private space. Peace fell upon me and I didn’t want to let go. In those few moments,
Garrett made my world okay.
“Charlie, I don’t think you should be alone tonight. I can stay at your place if you’d like.”
I looked at his familiar face and said, “I’m staying with my parents tonight. In my old room. I couldn’t
stand the thought of being home alone. Without Mitch.”
“Oh, good. You don’t have to be alone at any time. You have a lot of people in your life who love you.
Including me.”
“I know,” I said, squeezing his hand. “I’m so glad you’re here. So, tell me everything. How’s life in
New York?”
“I love living there. The city is so alive, fluid, something’s always going on. It was a good decision for
me to move there.”
“Well, you couldn’t turn down the amazing job offer with Studios Architecture. I know it was your
dream to work for them.”
“It’s been amazing. I’ve been able to design buildings I’d only dreamt about. I love my job and I’ve
learned a ton.”
“I could never do what you do. I’m not that creative. But I admire your abilities to create something out
of nothing,” I said before taking a sip of my drink. “So, how’s your love life?” It was a relief to talk about
something other than my problems.
“I date,” he said with an unreadable expression.
“You haven’t met anyone special to settle down with?”
Garrett looked down for a second, then back at me. “There was one woman who was extremely
special to me, but she chose some other guy.”
“I can’t believe anyone would choose someone else over you. You’re the total package. I bet you have
the women swarming at your feet.”
“I do okay,” he said.
“I’m sure you’ll find the right person soon. Any woman would be lucky to have you.”
“Well, Mitch is a lucky guy. You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to him. The day he met you, he
was stoked. I could see it all over his face when I met up with all of you for lunch. Then he came to my
dorm room after and couldn’t stop talking about you. I think he was already in love with you from the first
day. I remember specifically how he couldn’t get over that you have one green eye and one brown.”
“It is an unusual feature. I’ve always been so self-conscious about it.”
“Your eyes are beautiful, Charlie, just like the rest of you.”
“You’re so sweet, Garrett. Thanks for cheering me up,” I said, grateful for my old friend. “I’m glad we
ran into each other tonight, but I need to get home. We always have early Monday morning meetings at
work, so I’ve gotta get to bed.”
“So, you’re working tomorrow?”
“I debated about not going in, but since I can’t see Mitch anyway, work’s a good distraction.”
“True. Keeping busy helps. I’m sure in the next few days Mitch will remember you and he’ll be pissed
at our mom for contacting Heather. It’s all gonna work out.”
“When you say it, I actually believe it.”
“Believe it, Charlie. He’s so in love with you. He’ll find his way back and I’m here to help him do it.”
“I hope it happens quickly. We’re planning on getting married on February 22nd.”
“That soon? I hadn’t heard.”
“It was a decision we made yesterday. Mitch asked me why we were waiting until June when we
could start our lives together sooner.”
“Makes sense. Are you ready to get going?”
“Yes,” I said, standing up. “I’ll call you tomorrow to find out what’s going on, if that’s okay.”
“Sure. Give me your phone and I’ll put my number in.”
We exchanged phones and entered our respective numbers.
Garrett walked me out to my car and we said goodbye. Having him here gave me a glimmer of hope.
Chapter Sixteen
MITCH
I woke up to Heather’s smile beaming at me. I wasn’t expecting to see her this morning, but I sure was
glad she was here. Her familiar face had a calming effect on me.
“Good morning, beautiful,” I said, as I pulled her in for a kiss.
“Good morning,” she purred back at me.
“I wasn’t expecting to see you this morning.”
“I decided to take a sick day. I just wanted to be with you.”
“Good,” I sighed. “I need you to be here with me.”
My doctor came in and told me my CAT scan came back normal and he was hopeful I’d regain my
memory soon. But then he slightly retracted his statement by saying there was no guarantee my memories
would be restored. Heather asked him when I’d be released. Dr. Grayson said they had a few more tests
to run, but if everything came back normal, I could be released as early as tomorrow since I was so
healthy. He also said I’d need to take some medication for the next few months or so. Then, he was paged
and left abruptly.
“I just wanna get you out of here,” Heather said.
“Trust me, I’m ready to go.”
“Where are you planning on going?”
“Obviously, it’d be too awkward to live at my current place, so I guess I’ll stay with my folks.”
“You’re welcome to stay at my place anytime you want,” Heather said suggestively.
“I’ll be taking you up on that offer. I do remember what it was like when we were together. It was
really good.”
“Yes it was,” Heather said, with a slight moan. “So, you can stay with me if you don’t wanna stay with
your parents.”
“Good to know,” I said, sliding my hand up her thigh. She leaned down and kissed me again. All I
could remember was how much I liked being alone with her. I wanted to have that experience again.
Breaking our kiss, I said, “I’ll need to get my things, but we can do that when Charlie is working. I’m
assuming she works.”
Heather nodded, then looked at her watch. “I don’t know about you, but I’m hungry. What would you
like for breakfast?”
“I’d love a breakfast burrito with eggs and sausage.”
“I know a perfect place not far from here. Do you want coffee too?”
“Coffee would be great. Maybe after food and coffee I might feel more human again.”
“I’ll be back soon,” she said, kissing me on the forehead.
Garrett walked in the door as Heather was about to leave.
“Heather,” he said with a slight nod.
“Garrett.”
I found their coolness toward each other to be weird. Last I remembered we went out all the time with
Garrett and whomever he was dating at the time. He and Heather always seemed to get along.
“Bro, why are you and Heather so formal with each other?”
“We just don’t get along very well.”
“Did something happen between the two of you?”
“Don’t worry about it, bro. You just need to concentrate on getting your memory back.”
My brother was so indifferent with me and I had no idea why. We had been so close and now he
seemed like a stranger.
“Well, you may not like her, but Heather is here for me.”
“Charlie would be, but Mom barred her from the room. She gave a list to the nurses’ station.”
“What? Does Mom really dislike Charlie that much?”
“Apparently.”
“Why would Mom do that? Has Charlie given her a reason?”
Before Garrett could say any more, our mom walked in, all smiles.
“It’s so good to see my boys together. It’s been too long.”
Mom put her arms around Garrett. “You came in late and left early. I haven’t even seen you yet.”
“I took Charlie out for coffee after she found out you banned her from seeing Mitch and then got up
early to work out. I came here from the gym.”
The look on Mom’s face was terse and I expected her to have a sharp comeback, but she held her
tongue.
“How are you feeling today, Mitch?” she asked.
“Better than yesterday. I’m feeling almost back to normal.”
“Good. You’ve got more color in your face.”
Garrett looked like he wanted to poke his own eyes out. The anger he felt toward our mother shot from
his body like the heat from the sun. Our mother didn’t acknowledge what he’d said, brushing him off like
usual. Memories of her inconsideration toward him came rushing back. Looking back and forth between
them I wondered who was going to break first.
“Mom, why did you make a list of visitors? Mitch should be spending time with his fiancée. She can
help him remember.”
“Garrett, I know you mean well, but until you’re a parent you’re not going to understand my decisions.
I did what I thought was best.”
“Best for whom? Mitch or you?”
“That’s enough, Garrett.”
I put my hand to my forehead. Their bickering was getting to me, pounding on my head like I was in a
boxing match and I didn’t know how to handle it. I didn’t even know how I felt about the fact my mother
was keeping me from seeing Charlie. The only thing that seemed real to me was being a senior in high
school and being with Heather. I didn’t want to deal with any of this.
“Garrett, you’re upsetting your brother. Maybe you should come back later after you have calmed
down about my decision.”
Just as Garrett was about to open his mouth, Heather came in with breakfast.
“Heather,” my mom gushed. “Did you take the day off work?”
“Yes. I wanted to spend some time with Mitch.”
With that, Garrett stood up. “I have some things I need to take care of. I’ll come back later, Mitch.” He
was out the door before I had a chance to open my mouth.
I had no idea why my mother and Garrett were at such odds. “Mom, what the hell’s going on? What’s
happened with Garrett? He seems so angry with both of us.”
“I think it’d be better to tell you about all of this once you’re out of the hospital and on the mend. You
don’t need to worry about family squabbles right now.”
What’s going on? Heather and Mom seem to be best friends. Garrett and I are at an impasse. Garrett
clearly dislikes Heather, but won’t tell me why. This is so fucking confusing. I want to hit a wall.
Chapter Seventeen
CHARLIE
I was physically at work, but my mind was a million miles away. The meeting had been horrendous as
I couldn’t concentrate on anything being said, let alone contribute anything of value. At least my boss
clued in and didn’t ask me too many questions or to elaborate on anything HR had been working on. When
I entered my office, I noticed Chip was at my desk, doing more updates to my laptop.
“Hey Chip,” I managed.
“Hey Charlie, just doing some updates. Hope you don’t mind. I took advantage of the quiet.”
“Not at all.”
“Well, I’m all done,” he said as he practically raced out of my office.
Just like that, I was alone. I collapsed in my chair and put my head down. A long meeting on top of
everything else was not what I needed. I had to try to get it together.
I was staring out the window when Trace Michaels, CEO of TEK Communications, walked into my
office. He was the head honcho and I reported directly to him.
“Charlie, what’s going on? Clearly you’re not yourself today. Are you not feeling well?”
I looked up into my boss’ handsome face, which was etched with concern for me. “Mitch had an
accident…” I said, getting choked up.
“Shit. Is he going to be okay?”
“He has a brain injury and he’s lost his short-term memory. He doesn’t know me.”
By this point, Trace had made his way to my desk and sat in the chair across from me.
“Why are you here right now and not with him? Is he in the hospital?”
“I’ve been banned from his room by my future mother-in-law.”
“What? There must be a mistake. How could she do that?”
Tears spilled from my eyes and all I could do was shake my head. “She hates me,” I whispered.
Exhaustion overcame me and I placed my head on my desk, sobbing quietly. Trace came around and
knelt next to me, placing his hand gently on the back of my head, stroking my hair.
“Come here,” he said, pulling me up from my chair. “You need to lie down and rest.”
Trace walked me over to the sofa in my office and I lay down. He pulled a chair over and sat there
holding my hand. As he stroked the back of my hand with his thumb, silence overtook the space. He didn’t
ask me any further questions and I didn’t volunteer any information. I closed my eyes and began drifting…
drifting into the abyss of sleep.
“Charlie,” I heard him call out. “There’s my beautiful girl. What do you wanna do today?”
I looked up into the face of the man I loved. “I don’t care as long as I get to do it with you.”
“I got the newspaper from the grocery store so we can see what’s going on this weekend. Looks like
there are some bands from the eighties playing downtown. We could invite Kate and David.”
“I’ll call her and see what they’re doing…”
I felt someone touching my face, but I didn’t want to wake up. I wanted to stay with Mitch, but it was
too late. The dream was fading away as I began to open my eyes.
“Garrett,” I said, surprised to see him.
“Hey, Charlie. I thought I could take you to lunch if you were up for it.”
“Okay.”
As I was beginning to sit up, Trace popped his head back in. “Charlie, I want you to take some time
off. We’ll manage without you for a few days.”
“Okay…thank you. Garrett, this is my boss, Trace.” They shook hands. “Garrett is Mitch’s brother.”
“Well then, I know Charlie’s in good hands. Look after her until your brother is back on his feet again.”
Garrett nodded. “Will do.”
“Charlie, let me know if you need anything. Otherwise, I don’t expect to see you back the rest of the
week. Keep me informed as to what’s going on.”
“I will. Thanks, Trace.”
I grabbed my purse and Garrett and I began walking out of my office. Leaving was overwhelming,
because I didn’t know what I was going to do with myself. At least being at work was the norm. Now I
was either going to hang out with my parents or go home to my empty apartment.
Garrett put his hand on the small of my back. “How are you holding up?”
“I keep thinking I’m gonna wake up and all of this will be some crazy nightmare. I can’t stand the
thought of this being my new reality.”
Garrett looked at me contritely. He didn’t say anything, but I wasn’t expecting him to. What could he
say? My life seemed to be going down in flames, and unless Mitch remembered, this was how life was
going to be. Misshapen. Unraveled. Distorted.
“Any idea what you’d like to eat?” Garrett asked.
“Could we just pick up Chinese food? My apartment isn’t far from here. I don’t really wanna be at a
restaurant if that’s okay.”
“Of course. Whatever you want is fine.”
Garrett followed me to Panda Express. We got our food and he followed me home. At least I wouldn’t
be here alone and I could get some more things for staying with my parents. I’d only brought a couple of
outfits there. Wishful thinking I guess. I kept hoping Mitch would snap out of this. I ached to be in his arms
again.
We got back to my place in no time. Garrett carried in the food and I headed toward the kitchen for
plates and silverware. Garrett put the bags on the table and began taking out our order.
“Did you see Mitch today?” I asked.
“I did briefly. I had to leave when I confronted our mother about her list of visitors.”
“Is she gonna let me see him? Did he say anything about me?” I asked anxiously.
Garrett shook his head slightly. “No. She’s cozied up to Heather and they were both there when I left.”
I suddenly wasn’t very hungry. I hated all of it. I just wanted my Mitch back.
“Why does your mom love Heather so much?” I asked, staring down at my food.
“I think it’s because Heather always bent over and puckered up. Plus, Heather is easy for my mom to
manipulate and she gets off on being in control.”
“Why?”
“I’m not sure. It’s just how she’s wired. She hasn’t been able to control me since I moved to New
York. Once Mitch started dating you, she lost her grip on him. Now she only has my dad to control.”
“So that’s why she doesn’t like me? Because she’s lost control over Mitch since we’ve been
together?”
“Pretty much.”
“I guess I don’t see Mitch as someone who’d let his mother take over his life.”
“Mitch changed a lot when he met you. You gave him something he needed.”
“When Mitch and I met, I was a mess.”
“That didn’t matter to him. I know from the moment he met you, you were the only woman he wanted.”
The memory of Mitch protecting me from Eric swept through me. “He saved me, you know.”
“You saved him too, Charlie.”
The look on my face must have been confused, because Garrett continued. “You’re his soul mate.”
“I hope he remembers that.”
“Me too, Charlie.” Garrett looked at my plate. “You need to eat.”
I took a few bites, but I couldn’t get the food down. I ended up running to the bathroom, making it just
in time. Throwing up was the worst, and it shook all the strength from my body. I barely had the ability to
get up from the floor and was washing my face when Garrett knocked at the door. I grabbed the
mouthwash to get the disgusting taste out of my mouth.
“Charlie, can I come in?”
“Yeah, come in.”
“Are you all right?”
“I will be. I’m just exhausted. I couldn’t sleep last night. Too much on my mind.”
Garrett extended his hand to me. “Let me get you to bed. You need to rest.”
I took his hand. He put his arm around me and guided me to my bedroom. When I sat on the bed, he
knelt down and began removing my shoes. I could scarcely keep my eyes open. “Please. Don’t. Go.”

GARRETT
Charlie was sound asleep as I continued taking off her clothes. There was no way I’d leave her,
especially after she asked me to stay. I told myself she’d be more comfortable sleeping without her suit
on, but the truth was, Mitch wasn’t the only one who had fallen for her so many fateful years ago.
I’d felt the pull toward her when I met up with them for lunch on that first day of school. I was in my
sophomore year. If only I’d met her first, things would be different. She’d be my girl, and I wouldn’t have
a huge hole in my heart no other woman could fill. It’s why I moved away—far away—so I didn’t have to
be tortured seeing them together all the time. Mitch knew, but he never told Charlie. My mom knew too.
Another reason she disliked Charlie so much.
How could I tell her any of this? I didn’t want to hurt her any more than she was already hurting.
Moving away was the hardest thing I’d ever done. Not a day went by that I didn’t think about her and wish
things were different. She was the first thing on my mind when I woke up, and the last thing when I went to
sleep.
Was this my chance? If Mitch didn’t remember, would she eventually let go of him and see me? See
that I loved her? I was such a selfish bastard for even thinking this right now. My brother was laid up in
the hospital and all I can do is think about myself.
I unbuttoned Charlie’s blouse and carefully removed it from her body. Her lace bra displayed her
breasts perfectly and I felt a pull in my groin. I wanted her in the worst way, but I had to stay in control at
all costs and not let my overwhelming desire for her get the best of me. Unzipping her pants, I pulled them
down and removed them too. I’d leave her in her bra and panties so she wouldn’t be too embarrassed.
It wouldn’t be the first time I saw her naked. One time, when my parents were out of town for the
weekend, she stayed over. I had no idea she was getting out of the shower when I barged in thinking Mitch
was in there. Thought I’d bust his chops. She screamed and I thought Mitch was going to beat me within
an inch of my life. It was an honest mistake, but one I’ll never forget. Her beautiful body with water
glistening on it would be forever etched in my mind.
I covered Charlie with the blanket and then went around to the other side of the bed and lay down next
to her. Inhaling her hair was intoxicating, and I spooned my body against hers. Hopefully when she woke
up she wouldn’t mind my proximity.
Breathing her in, I remembered back to the weekend she stayed with us. Mitch had fallen asleep while
we watched some chick flick. At the end, someone died and Charlie was tearing up. I put my hand on her
arm and asked if she was okay. That’s when I realized staying in California was out of the question
because my heart was racing just touching her. I was a senior in college and hadn’t gotten over my
brother’s girl. I knew I never would. My love for her had grown and even though I went out with other
women, none of them compared to her. So I began applying to firms on the east coast a couple of months
before graduation. No one knew I’d accepted a job until I was packing up my things.
My mom was livid and I expected her to yell at Charlie about it, inform her that I was in love with her.
But, she didn’t. She closed my bedroom door behind me and didn’t come with me to the airport. She told
me to stay away until Charlie was out of my system. My dad drove me to the airport and I didn’t even
have the guts to say goodbye to my brother. I left him a lame letter saying I was offered a job and had to
start right away. I texted and emailed, but didn’t actually speak to him. We’d had a fight about my feelings
for Charlie a couple of days before I left and I just couldn’t face him, even on the phone.
Now here I was, in bed with his woman, while he was in the hospital remembering his love with
Heather. I’d give up just about anything to be the man she was in love with. Maybe if Mitch rejected her
enough she’d turn to me for comfort. My arms were more than happy to hold her, make her feel safe and
secure. Holding her now made me realize I wanted everything from her: her heart, mind, body, and soul. I
didn’t want to share anymore with my brother.
Chapter Eighteen
MITCH
It was seven in the morning and I was expecting the doctor to give me the green light to go home. All of
my tests came back normal, and he thought being in familiar surroundings could help my memory.
Dr. Grayson finished writing my prescription and handed it to my mom. “Mitch will most likely still
experience acute pain from where his head hit the cement. This prescription will help with the pain.”
“Any special instructions, Doctor?” my mother asked.
“Mitch needs to be in a calm, soothing environment. No stress at all. I’m releasing him because his
tests are normal, but any signs of vision loss or headache, bring him to the hospital immediately. I want
you to come back in a week for a check-up. If anything changes, notify me right away.”
He handed my mother his card. “I’ll make sure he follows your instructions and he stays relaxed.”
The doctor nodded. “Mitch, if you feel anything out of the ordinary, you need to return to the hospital.
Your brain is healing, but it’s not a hundred percent recovered. Take it easy.”
“I will, Dr. Grayson. Thanks for everything.”
Heather wheeled me out and my mother trailed behind. I felt awkward holding the box of pictures
Charlie had brought me to show our life together while leaving the hospital with another woman. I’d seen
some reruns of The Twilight Zone before, and it definitely seemed like I was starring in one of them. Still,
nothing made sense.
“We should stop at the pharmacy on the way home,” my mom said as she followed.
“Yeah, there’s a couple of things I need from the drug store too,” Heather said.
They got me situated in the car and Heather drove us to the pharmacy. I rarely came here for anything
since I hated to take medicine. We walked up to the counter and gave the young woman the prescription.
The pharmacist came up to the front and extended his hand to me. “Mitch, it’s a surprise to see you
here with a bandaged head. Hope it isn’t too serious.”
I shook his hand but had no idea who he was. His nametag read Eric Machado. Must be someone I met
sometime during the last few years.
“Eric, I’m sure I should know you, but I’ve had some memory loss due to my head injury. I can’t place
you right now.”
“Oh, I’m sorry to hear that. We had some classes together in college. I knew Charlie.”
I nodded.
“So, you two aren’t together anymore?”
“Well, apparently we’re engaged, but I simply don’t remember. I can’t remember anything after
graduation from high school.”
“Wow, that sucks.”
“Yeah, the doctor has no idea if my memory will come back. It’s a giant clusterfuck.”
“Mitch, I’m gonna pick up a few items. I’ll find you when I’m done,” Heather said.
“Is that your sister?” Eric asked.
“No, she’s my girlfriend. We haven’t seen each other in a long time, but somehow we’ve picked up
right where we left off.”
“Wow, you and Charlie must have broken up then. You were so into each other.”
“I honestly don’t know where things stand right now.”
“Oh, well, I’m just surprised, is all.”
I was trying to read Eric’s face. His furrowed brow did tell me that Charlie and I not being together
did, in fact, surprise him.
“So, were we pretty good friends in college? I wish I could remember.”
“Yeah, I’d say we knew each other well. Hung out. Studied together. The usual college stuff.”
“And so you became a pharmacist?”
“Yeah. I just started here not too long ago.”
“Well, it’s good to see you, man. I’m gonna check on my girl. Mom, will you wait for my
prescription?”
“Sure, honey. I’ll wait here. You go on and find Heather.”
Twenty minutes later and my prescription was ready. I assumed I had a job, although, with no
knowledge of the past seven years, it’s doubtful I’d be able to do anything there anyway. Would they hold
my job open for me? My mom assured me she had contacted my boss and they were aware of my injury.
I needed to get things taken care of and work out what my new future would look like. Life with
Heather? Well, that felt somewhat normal to me, so it seemed like the most logical choice. I couldn’t
imagine an alternative.
After we settled into my old room, Heather reminded me we needed to get my clothes from my
townhouse. The one I shared with Charlie. How surreal. It was after nine, so perhaps now would be a
good time to go there. She should be at work.
Chapter Nineteen
CHARLIE
When I walked in the door, candles were flickering throughout the living room. Mitch had moved the
coffee table and spread a blanket on the floor. He’d made an indoor picnic for us, surprising me after
a long week at work. My first week with the company. My thoughtful man had struck again and I so
loved him for it.
As I closed the door behind me, Mitch appeared carrying a tray of cheese, crackers, and red grapes.
I spotted a glass of wine waiting for me.
Mitch wrapped his free arm around me, whispering, “Welcome home, baby.”
“It’s good to be home with you,” I responded in his ear, nipping at it a little.
“I want you to relax. I know your first week has kept you on your toes.”
My first week had been insane, but I had survived. Now Mitch was giving me a reward for all my
effort at work. My man seemed to have the gateway to my heart and pulled out the stops just when I
needed him to.
Mitch raised his glass to make a toast. “To surviving the first week at your dream job. I’m so proud
of you, baby.”
We clinked our glasses and each took a sip. Before I could say anything, Mitch was offering me
cheese and crackers. I had a couple of bites before he took me in his arms.
“I hope you’re not too hungry right now. I have something other than food in mind.”
“You know I love all of your ideas, baby,” I said, caressing his face with my hand.
Before I knew it, Mitch had my blouse and skirt removed. He wasn’t one to waste any time. Lifting
his shirt over his head, I gazed at his chiseled chest, tracing the muscles of his abs with my finger. I
didn’t know why, but every time I saw Mitch’s chest, I got weak in the knees. He was…perfect.
Mitch put his hands on my face and began kissing me, slowly, teasingly at first, making me want
him that much more. My hands slid up his abs, over his broad chest, finding their way to his muscled
arms. He pulled us to the floor, unhooking my bra on the way down.
His kiss captured my mouth, making me tremble, and a wave of excitement raced through my body. I
began undoing his belt and Mitch helped with removing his jeans and briefs. There he was, my
gorgeous man, all mine in every way. My Adonis that even Michelangelo wouldn’t have been able to
capture completely.
Slipping off my panties, he found his way to my hot, wet core and inserted one finger inside me. My
sticky juice was all over his fingers as he began stroking my clit, kissing me at the same time. He knew
exactly how I loved to be touched and I knew I’d be screaming out his name in no time. When it came
to my body, Mitch had made himself an expert.
His hand continued as his kisses made their way down my neck and to my left nipple. Swirling
around it with his tongue, a tight rosy bud formed. He scraped his teeth over my nipple and that was
my undoing. Everything crashing around me, I screamed out. Mitch whispered in my ear, “I love
hearing you come.”
Waking up abruptly, I found myself in Garrett’s arms. For a split second, I thought Mitch was holding
me, taking me from elation to disappointment to guilt. What was I doing in bed with Garrett? Had I lost
my mind too?
Garrett was sound asleep, but I couldn’t move with his body holding onto mine. Carefully, I lifted his
arm, placing it on his side. I slipped out of bed and headed toward the bathroom. Grabbing the chenille
robe off the hook on the back of the bathroom door, I wrapped myself up in its coziness. I wondered how I
ended up in just my bra and panties. I guess I should be grateful I at least had them on. It would’ve been
really embarrassing to have Garrett see me completely naked. Once was enough back in college. He was
my fiancé’s brother, after all. He’d always been wonderful to me, but I didn’t want something to happen
that couldn’t be undone. After all, Mitch could be remembering his life right now.
Walking back into my bedroom, I noticed Garrett beginning to stir. “Thanks for staying with me last
night…looking after me.”
“No problem,” he said, sitting up. His shirt was off and seeing his chest reminded me of Mitch. They
were very similar in their appearance—the tall, dark, handsome, muscular type.
“I hope you don’t mind that I undressed you. I wanted you to sleep comfortably.”
“It’s fine. Really no different than you seeing me in my bathing suit,” I said, but somehow it was. We’d
been in bed together and something could have happened. I’d always really liked Garrett and if I had met
him first…I don’t know what would’ve happened.
“Are you okay?” Garrett asked.
“As okay as I can be. I should find my phone and call my parents. They might be worried about me.”
Garrett grabbed my phone off the nightstand next to him. “Your mom called last night. I told her we
were here and I was gonna keep you company.”
I breathed a sigh of relief. “Thanks. I hate for her to worry.”
Garrett sat there staring at me for a moment. I wondered what he was thinking. Tension filled the air
and I didn’t know how to handle it. What to say? What to do? My hands were fidgety from his gaze.
“I make a pretty mean omelet if you have the ingredients,” Garrett offered.
That’d work. We’d get out of this bedroom and hopefully I’d start feeling more comfortable.
“Breakfast is my favorite meal, so I have everything you need. If you’re really hungry, I can make
pancakes.”
“I’m pretty hungry. Haven’t eaten since yesterday afternoon.”
Garrett proceeded to get up and put on his jeans and shirt. “I’ll get things started.”
After he left my bedroom, I got dressed. The awkwardness was beginning to wear off and I hoped by
the time I was done with my first cup of coffee everything would be back to normal.
The smell of eggs and turkey sausage made my stomach rumble as I entered the kitchen. The last thing I
ate didn’t exactly stay put. “Would you like coffee?” I asked, assuming he would.
“Yes, coffee is a must.”
“How many cups?”
“I usually drink two or three.”
I no sooner flipped the switch on the coffee than I heard the front door open. Garrett and I looked at
each other.
“Are you expecting anyone?” he asked.
“No. Whoever it is has a key. Mitch is the only other—”
I walked out of the kitchen to find Mitch and Heather standing in the doorway. What the hell?
“Mitch, you’re back.” I couldn’t stop myself from running to him, practically throwing myself into his
arms. He stood there frozen and didn’t hug me in return. The coldness from him chilled me to the bone and
I let go, even though I didn’t want to. I stood there staring into his eyes searching for the man I knew, but
he wasn’t there. A stranger stared back at me.
“You still don’t remember.”
“No. I’m just here to get some of my things.”
I barely swallowed down my disappointment as his words echoed in my mind.
“I’m glad they released you and you’re up and around.” I didn’t know what else to say. I really wanted
to scream, cry, throw things…have a full-on tantrum, but that wasn’t going to do any good right now.
Remaining calm was my best course of action.
“Yeah, all my tests are normal. They had no reason to keep me. Heather’s gonna help me get some
things if that’s okay.”
By this point, Garrett had come into the living room.
“It’s not what it looks like. Nothing happened between Garrett and me,” I said, feeling guilty although I
didn’t know why.
Mitch shrugged slightly. “Charlie, I’m sure you’re a great woman, but I…I just don’t remember. I only
remember Heather and my feelings for her.”
I tried to catch my breath, but I couldn’t. His words had knocked the air right out of me. I backed up
and sat on the sofa taking in deep breaths. Garrett took over.
“I’ll show you where your things are, Mitch. Come with me.”
All three of them walked down the hall. I sat there, with the room spinning, wishing I could get off this
wild ride. Tears streamed down my face and all I could do was hold onto the sofa. I could hear muffled
voices and finally Garrett was back, but Mitch and Heather were still in my bedroom. The bedroom I
shared with Mitch. The man I was going to marry in a few weeks. This really couldn’t be happening.
“They’ll be leaving in a few minutes,” Garrett said.
I nodded. Words failed me.
“I’m gonna check on the food. I’ll be right back.”
I put my head back on the sofa and closed my eyes. Kate should be home tonight. I needed my best
friend so badly. Maybe she could help jog Mitch’s memory. They’d known each other since their freshman
year of high school.
Mitch and Heather had packed a bag and were about to leave. “Heather, I’ll meet you out front in a
minute.”
“Okay,” Heather said.
Mitch sat on the sofa with me. I looked at him and fought like hell to keep the tears out of my eyes.
“I know this is gonna make me a cold-hearted bastard, but I wanna break up. I wanna be with Heather
and it’s not fair to string you along.”
“Mitch, you lost your memory on Saturday. Don’t you think you need a few days to rest before you
make any big decisions?”
“Charlie, I don’t need you to tell me what to do. I know what I want. Nothing’s gonna change my mind.
You’re gonna have to move on.”
His words were crashing down around me like a hailstorm. They were cruel and nothing he said
sounded like the man I knew. Where is my Mitch?
“Mitch, I’m not trying to tell you what to do. You’ve just had a trauma and maybe taking a few days to
yourself wouldn’t be a bad idea.”
“Again, telling me what I should do. If I wanna be with Heather, then that’s what I’m gonna do. It’s
over for us.”
I looked into his steely eyes. Eyes that used to look at me adoringly, but I saw no emotion. “Take care
of yourself,” I managed.
“You too,” he said, standing and then walking to the door. Suddenly, all my dreams were completely
shattered. Along with my heart. I was no longer Mitch’s fiancée. I was no longer going to be married in a
few weeks. I couldn’t help shaking. He’s gone. He’s left me for her. Just like that. How is that possible? I
could barely breathe with the anguish gripping my heart.
Garrett had returned to the living room, but all he could do was watch as Mitch left. I sat there numb,
in disbelief of what had happened. Mitch just walked out on me. He was gone.
Garrett sat next to me. “Come here,” he said, pulling me into his arms. I couldn’t be strong any longer
and I began sobbing.
“It’s gonna be okay. He’s not himself. He’ll remember you, Charlie. You’re gonna have to be strong.”
I looked up at Garrett. “How do you know?”
“I know because…I’d never be able to forget you.”
“Oh, Garrett. You’re so sweet.”
“No, I’m not. I’m a man tormented by what I can’t have.”
“What are you talking about? What can’t you have?”
Garrett put his hands on my face. “You, Charlie. My brother met you first and I can’t have you,” he
said, eyes filled with longing.
“I…I—”
“You don’t have to say anything. My timing sucks and I’m an ass for bringing this up now. You should
be kicking me out.”
“Garrett, you’re not an ass and it’s probably just a crush.”
Before Garrett could respond, my cell phone rang. “Kate,” I said before answering it. I needed her…I
just needed her.
“Kate, are you and Neil on your way back home yet?” The urgency in my voice was undeniable.
“Yes. Charlie, what’s wrong? You sound upset.”
“Kate, there was an accident. Mitch fell and hit his head. He doesn’t remember me, Kate. He thinks
he’s eighteen and he just broke up with me. I don’t know what to do.”
“Oh my God. Are you serious?”
“Yes, he just left here with Heather,” I choked out.
“He’s with Heather?”
“Yeah, you know her, right?”
“Yes. The four of us hung out all the time. Neil and I are about forty-five minutes away. We’re coming
straight over. I’ll be there soon and you can fill me in on everything.”
I breathed a sigh of relief. “I can’t wait to see you.”
“Me too, Charlie.”
Chapter Twenty
MITCH
“So, do you wanna come back to my place?” Heather asked as she started her car.
“I think I need to go home and rest. Something doesn’t feel right. Maybe Charlie’s right and I should
take a few days.”
“You know, Mitch, my life moved on after we broke up, so if you’re not interested in being with me,
just say so. I have no problem getting dates.”
I put my hand on Heather’s leg. “No, baby, I want you. I’m just tired and I need to lie down.”
“Of course,” she said, placing her hand on mine. “I’ll take you home right now.”
“Thanks, Heather. I appreciate you driving me and helping me. I just feel bad for being such a dick.”
“Being a dick to whom? Me or Charlie?”
Confusion spread over me and I had no idea where Heather was going with this. But somehow I knew I
better be apologizing to her.
“Heather, in my mind we haven’t broken up. Yet, we have in reality, but you’re here with me now. I
feel I should apologize to you. For Charlie. It seems everything would be different if I hadn’t broken up
with you.”
“You’re right. We’d probably be married right now with a family of our own. Instead, you’ve wasted
years with someone else. I’m not even sure if this is gonna work.”
What is she saying? “Heather please…please forgive me. I want you, no one else.”
“Hopefully you’ll be able to show me that soon instead of just telling me. I couldn’t help but notice the
nice rock on Charlie’s left hand. That should be mine, Mitch,” she said, glancing over at me with a slight
glare in her eyes.
“You’re right. I fucked up,” I said, putting my hand to my head. All of this stress was giving me a
headache.
“Well, we can talk more after you’ve had a chance to rest,” she said, pulling up in front of my parents’
house.
We walked in, not saying much. My mother greeted us enthusiastically.
“Mitch, are you all right?”
“I just have a headache. The doctor said I’d have some.”
“Have you taken your meds yet?”
“No.”
“I’ll bring it to you with a glass of water. Why don’t you go lie down?”
I made my way to my room. It felt like I’d just been here a few days ago. I couldn’t even imagine living
with Charlie in the townhouse I’d just left. I also wasn’t sure why Heather was saying her life had moved
on. I couldn’t lose her. I loved her so much. Don’t I?
Heather and my mom came in with my pill and water. I took it and then lay on my bed.
“I’m gonna let you rest.”
“Will you be here when I wake up?”
“Of course she will, honey. Heather’s going to visit with me while you sleep.”
I nodded. “Can you give us a minute, Mom?”
“Certainly,” my mom said and then left us.
Reaching my hand up to Heather’s, I pulled her down to the bed to sit next to me. “I’m sorry. I know
things are difficult. Please just promise me you aren’t going anywhere.”
“I’m not going anywhere, Mitch. I love you, even though you broke my heart.”
“Maybe when I’m up to it we can talk about that. I’m gonna make everything up to you.”
“You get some rest. I’ll see you when you wake up. I’m gonna visit with your mom. Catch up on
things.” Heather kissed me on my forehead. Then she left, closing the door behind her.

HEATHER
“How about we have a glass of wine while Mitch is sleeping?”
“I’d like that.”
“White okay?”
“Yes.”
“Why don’t we toast to new beginnings? I’m assuming you did what I told you to.”
“You were right, Lillian. I did your takeaway plan in the car. Mitch apologized and promised to make
things up to me the moment he thought he might lose me. How did you know that would work?”
“Honey, I know how to get my way when it comes to men. They always want what they can’t have.
He’ll work hard to keep you now and Charlie will be out of his life for good.”
“Looks like I have a lot to learn from you.”
“Well, you and I always were two peas in a pod. We’re both women who know what we want and go
after it. It’s just too bad you got greedy in high school.”
“I was an idiot. I never should have cheated on Mitch.”
“You were dumb for getting caught. You’ll learn. I’ve never been caught after all these years being
married. Edward has no idea what I do and he never will. Mitch will be a good husband and you’ll get to
do what you want, just like me.”
“Well, I actually love Mitch more than I realized. I’m not worried about finding someone else right
now.”
“Oh, I know. But you might at some point. And I’ll teach you everything I know. You’re the daughter I
never had.”
“I’m glad you’re here for me. With my mom dying a few years back, I’ve felt kind of lost.”
“Consider yourself found, Heather. You’re part of my family now. I’m your mother and you’re my
daughter.” We clinked our glasses together and continued sipping our wine.
Chapter Twenty-One
CHARLIE
I hadn’t touched the food Garrett brought out to me. I just sat there on the sofa, waiting for Kate, staring
into nothingness. She couldn’t get here soon enough. Garrett had stayed quiet and given me space by
cleaning the kitchen.
Kate was my best friend in the whole world and she knew everything about me, Mitch, and our
relationship. I needed her like I needed air. The forty-five minutes seemed like an eternity.
“I’d like to see Kate, but if you’d prefer I leave, I’ll understand.”
“You can stay,” I said, still staring. Even turning my head seemed like a feat I wasn’t capable of doing.
Every muscle in my body felt weighed down. Even talking had become a chore. Garrett sat next to me and
picked up my hand. “Don’t say it’s gonna be okay,” I muttered. “Mitch just broke up with me and left with
Heather.”
“He and Heather won’t make it. She’s too much like our mother. Very controlling and manipulative.
He’ll see through her.”
“So far, he’s not seeing anything but the past.”
“I wish I could make it better for you, Charlie.”
“Me too,” I said as I heard a knock on the door.
I got up to answer it. Kate and Neil stood there. Kate immediately hugged me, harder than I ever
thought possible. She stood there, holding me. I didn’t want to let go. Finally, I told them to come in.
“Garrett,” Kate called out. He got up to hug her and then she introduced him to Neil.
I filled Kate and Neil in on everything that’d happened right up to the moment Mitch abruptly dumped
me.
“I can’t believe it. Charlie, I’m so sorry you’re going through all of this.”
“Why would Lillian contact Heather?” Neil asked.
“My mom can control Heather, and through Heather, control Mitch. When he got the courage to break
up with Heather, my mom did everything in her power to get them back together,” Garrett responded.
“Yeah, I can see that. Oh, no…” Kate said, but didn’t finish her thought.
“What?” I asked.
“This means Mitch doesn’t remember David dying. He has to go through that all over again.”
“He asked me about David and I told him what happened,” Garrett said. “I’m sure he probably wants
to talk to you about it, Kate. He kept asking about David, so I had no choice but to tell him.”
“Of course. Who knows, maybe after talking to me it might jar his memory? He was just so broken up
over losing David; I hate that he’s gonna have to deal with it again.”
Tears rolled down my cheeks as I thought about everything. Kate put her arms around me and just held
me as I cried.
“Neil, maybe you and Garrett could get us something to drink?” Kate said.
Both of them got up and left us.
I looked at my best friend as she wiped the tears from my eyes. “I know everything has gone dark and
you can’t see a way for this to be okay, but the Charlie I know is strong and no matter what, you’re gonna
get through this. I’ll be with you every step of the way. I promise. Next to Neil, you’re the most important
person in the world to me.”
“I feel the same way. Why does everything you’ve said sound so familiar?”
“You basically said the same thing to me when David died. I couldn’t have gotten through that without
you, Charlie.”
“That’s what this is like. It’s as if Mitch has died. It feels the same. He’s simply gone.”
Kate squeezed my hand. “I wish I could make everything go back to normal. I know your heart is
breaking.”
“I know you would if you could. We’ve been through so much together. With you by my side, I can face
anything.”
“I’ll always be here for you. And just so you know, you can stay with Neil and me if you don’t wanna
stay here or with your parents. I have a guest room with your name on it.”
“You and Neil are newlyweds. You should have your privacy.”
“I’ve already talked to him and he has no problem with you staying in our guest room. The house is
big. We could go for days without seeing you,” Kate said with a chuckle.
“I might take you up on that.”
Neil and Garrett came back in with water for each of us. “How about we go get something to eat?”
Neil suggested.
“Sounds good. It’s getting close to dinnertime. Have you eaten anything today?” Kate asked.
“Garrett made us omelets.”
“Charlie, you really didn’t eat any of the omelet. You need to eat.”
“That settles it. Let’s get some Italian. Have some wine, fresh bread, pasta. We can go to Ciao’s. You
love their lobster ravioli,” Kate said.
The idea of going anywhere made my head hurt, but the alternative was sitting among friends in my
home, where Mitch would seemingly never return. As much as I didn’t want to go out, it seemed the better
option.
“Okay. But I need to take a quick shower and freshen up. I’ll be right back.”
Chapter Twenty-Two
MITCH
I woke up from a dream I was having about Charlie. I was proposing to her at her parents’ house, just
like she’d shown me on her phone. The only problem was I didn’t actually remember it—I remembered
her telling me about it and seeing the video.
I felt bad about how things had gone down between us. She was a victim in all of this and I had been a
complete bastard to her, for Heather’s sake. Something was off, but I didn’t know what it was. I needed to
talk to Garrett and find out why I broke up with Heather in the first place. And also why he’d spent the
night at my fiancée’s house. That didn’t sit right with me either. Anger was coursing through my veins at
the thought of him touching her.
My bedroom door opened and the light from the hallway shone in. Heather was peeking in.
“I’m awake,” I said so she could enter.
“Are you hungry? I thought we could get some dinner together.”
“Yeah, I’m starved.”
“What sounds good to you?”
“How about Italian?”
“That’s my favorite.”
“Okay, I’ll get dressed and be out in a minute.”
Heather drove us to a quaint restaurant I had no memory of. “Have we been here before?” I asked.
“No, I only discovered it a few years ago. The food is really delicious and they have a great wine
selection.”
“I probably shouldn’t mix my meds with alcohol. It’s not a good idea. Plus I’m not old enough to drink
anyway.”
“Oh, I’m sure it’ll be fine. Besides, you’re probably not gonna get carded—no one would mistake you
as underage.”
“Oh, yeah. I keep forgetting I’m twenty-five. How do you always know what I’m thinking? Losing my
memory has been surreal. It seems like we should be about to graduate.”
“Well, you’re already a college graduate. It’ll take a little bit of time, but you’ll get used to the
changes. You’re smart, Mitch—you’ll catch up.”
“I hope so.”
We made our way into the restaurant and I stopped dead in my tracks. Kate was sitting at a table with
some guy and I could see the backs of Charlie’s and Garrett’s heads. I just wanted food. I didn’t want to
deal with all of them right now, but Kate saw us and began making her way over to me.
“Mitch,” she said, pulling me in for a hug. Of course I knew who she was: my best friend’s girl. I
needed to know everything that happened to David.
“Kate, I’m glad to see you. I really need for us to talk, but not here, not tonight. We just came for a
quiet dinner. You remember Heather, right?”
“Of course. Hi Heather.”
“Hi Kate.”
“You have my number in your phone, so why don’t you call me when you’re up for a visit. I can be
available anytime.”
“I’d like us to talk tomorrow if that’s good for you.”
“Sure. Just tell me the time and place.”
“Can you come to my mom’s house around two, maybe?”
“Yes, I’ll see you then. Enjoy your dinner.” Kate returned to her table.
I asked the hostess to seat us away from Kate and Charlie. I really didn’t want to be in Charlie’s view.
I didn’t want to hurt her any more than I already had. I wasn’t that man. Somehow Heather had beguiled
me. Is that how it’d always been? I had to figure out what was bugging me about the situation. But for
now, all I wanted or needed was lasagna.
Chapter Twenty-Three
CHARLIE
Knowing Mitch and Heather were just tables away from us was excruciating. I downed my glass of
wine and then another. We’d already been served our food, so there was no leaving until we finished
eating.
Garrett leaned over and quietly asked me if I wanted him to take me home. But what would that
accomplish? I couldn’t just run away every time I saw Mitch. In fact, I wanted him to see me. Maybe, just
maybe, seeing me would bring forth some memory. We’d dined here together many times. There was no
way I was leaving.
“Thank you, Garrett, for being so considerate of my feelings, but I’m fine.”
“Just checking.”
I poured myself a third glass of wine. I needed to numb the pain in a hurry. Neil ordered another bottle
of the Riesling Kate and I liked since I’d already killed the bottle. He wasn’t just attentive to her—he
seemed to be very attuned to what I needed as well.
“So, tell us about your trip to Santa Barbara,” Garrett said.
“We had such an amazing time staying at the Four Seasons. It’s an incredible resort. We rented bikes
and rode on the boardwalk, walked along the beach…it was beautiful and romantic,” Kate said, beaming
at her husband.
“Sounds great. I do miss California.”
“You’re living in New York, right?” Neil inquired.
“Yes, for the last few years.”
“Kate told me you’re an accomplished architect. We’ll have to come out and see some of the buildings
you’ve designed when everything gets back to normal.”
“Yeah, I’d like that,” Garrett said.
“It’ll get back to normal, Charlie, and when it does, we can all do another trip together like Vegas,”
Neil said, as though he was reading my mind.
I looked over at him. “Thanks, Neil,” I said, nodding. He was so much more than smart and handsome.
He was kind and compassionate. I was grateful my best friend had such an amazing man in her life. For so
long, I’d been the only one with a love life. Now Kate was a wife and I imagined would be a mother
soon, too. Seeing her beaming glances toward her husband did my heart good. She made me believe in
happily ever after.
We continued eating, but I couldn’t help but peer in Mitch’s direction every chance I got. He and
Heather seemed quite cozy and all I could do was have another glass of wine to soothe my broken heart.
The buzz was helping take the edge off. I had a feeling Garrett was going to have to physically escort me
out of here when it was time to leave. Neil had just flagged the waiter for our bill. Within moments, we
were heading toward the door and Garrett had his arm around me, steadying me so I could put one foot in
front of the other. I couldn’t remember when I’d ever had this much to drink.
Neil and Kate dropped us off, leaving me in Garrett’s very capable hands. Once we were inside, I
wrapped my hands around his neck and asked him what he wanted to do.
“How about we get you to bed?”
I scrunched up my face and slurred, “Okay, but only if you’re gonna stay with me, otherwise I’m going
to my parents’ house.”
“I’ll stay. You’re in no condition to go anywhere.”
Staggering down the hall to my bedroom, I began taking off my clothes, dropping things along the way.
By the time I was standing next to my bed, I’d removed everything but my bra and thong. I heard Garrett
breathe in sharply. Everything was hazy as I fumbled with unhooking my bra, but I finally got it. When I let
it fall to the floor, Garrett just stood there, frozen. I skimmed my thong off and there I was, stark naked.
Garrett pulled the covers back for me and I got into bed. He covered me up quickly.
“Please tell me you’re not leaving me? I don’t wanna be alone. Stay with me?”
“Of course I’ll stay. I don’t want you to be alone either.”
I scooted into the bed and made space for him to get under the covers with me. “Garrett, I want you to
make me forget everything. Can you do that?” I asked, gazing up at him.
“Charlie, if I do, everything will change between us. I’m not sure you’re ready for that. But I’ll stay
and hold you, make you feel safe and loved. But we don’t have to make love for you to feel better. I don’t
want you to do anything that’s gonna betray your relationship with Mitch.”
“What relationship?” I choked out. “You were here when he broke up with me. Do you think Mitch and
Heather are just holding hands? That he’s waiting to be with her? He can’t even comprehend anything past
high school. I’m not on his radar.”
Garrett stripped down to his briefs and got into bed with me, not answering my question. But how
could he? We both knew the answer anyway. I always knew he was a good guy and he was proving it
tonight by not rushing to take me to bed. I had just offered myself to him, but he put Mitch before himself.
Another great quality they shared.
It was so good to have his body next to mine. I put my head on his chest and nestled under his chin. My
body was pressed against his, but I wasn’t taking into consideration what he could be going through. I
closed my eyes and began falling asleep. I knew I’d sleep well with Garrett by my side.
***
GARRETT
Charlie had wrapped herself around my body and I couldn’t help but have a reaction. If this was a test,
I was beginning to fail. Making love to her had been something I’d wanted for so long. She was the only
woman I’d ever loved. Sure, I’d dated my fair share of women and had more than my fair share of sex, but
I’d never felt about any woman the way I felt about her. I wanted her to actually want to be with me. To
love me.
Through our college years, we had a few times when Mitch went to bed and we stayed up. Tension had
always existed between us, but I figured it was more on my side than hers. Of course, I’d never make a
move on my brother’s girl, but what was happening now was different. He didn’t want her to be his girl
anymore and she was brokenhearted. If I did anything, she’d most likely feel taken advantage of and any
chance we could have might be ruined. I didn’t want to be the cause of any pain in her life. Garnering her
love meant too much to me. Damn it. Why do I have to be a good guy?
Not realizing how tired I really was, I began drifting to sleep, joining Charlie in slumber.
Chapter Twenty-Four
MITCH
“That was awkward,” Heather said after we got in the car.
“Which part?”
“You making plans to see Kate. You know she’s just gonna bring more confusion, don’t you?”
“Actually, I think talking to her will help. I’ve known her for so long and she was my best friend’s girl.
I need to talk to her.” I still can’t believe he’s gone. There’s a fucking hole in my heart.
“Well, I wish it wasn’t at a time when I’ll be working. Maybe you should reschedule for when I can be
available.”
“Heather, I’m not a child. I don’t need a chaperone for a conversation with Kate. She’s my friend and I
trust her. She’s like a sister to me.”
Heather stayed quiet for a moment. “I know you’re a grown man, but I’m just looking out for your best
interest. You have to keep in mind she’s Charlie’s friend as well. She’s gonna try to sway you to spend
time with Charlie.”
“Is that what you’re worried about? Kate’s influence over me?”
“Yes. Can you say with one hundred percent certainty she doesn’t have an influence in your life?
You’ve known her for years.”
“Exactly. She cares about me and has my best interest at heart. I think you’re overreacting a little.”
We pulled up in front of my house. I knew Heather was pissed, but I needed to talk to Kate and I
needed to do it alone. After a long silence, Heather reached out and took my hand.
“Don’t you think I have your best interest at heart?”
“Of course I do, Heather. I know you’re on my side.”
“Then can you trust me that spending time with Kate isn’t good for us?”
“But what if it’s good for me? I’m the one lost here. I’m missing years, Heather. It’s not like I got drunk
and can’t remember something I did. I’ve lost part of myself and Kate knows that part of me. I need to talk
to her about David too. I need you to understand.”
Heather exhaled loudly, giving in to my request. “Do what you have to do. At least your mom will be
there with you.”
Her statement lodged in my gut. I didn’t need my mommy to babysit me. All my mom had managed to
do was keep me from knowing what had happened in my life. Leaving the house to talk with Kate was
now very important. I didn’t want my mom to interfere.
“It’s been a long day and I need to get some sleep,” I said, leaning over to kiss her on the cheek.
“Do you want me to come in?” Heather asked with a hopeful voice.
“I’d love that, but I’m just exhausted. Can I see you tomorrow night?”
“Sure. I’ll come over after work.”
“Great. See you then.” We kissed goodnight and I made my way into the house.
It occurred to me entering my bedroom I should slow down. Everything was happening in fast forward
and if I was going to make a life with Heather, I needed to get to know her now. I was expecting the girl I
dated, but she had changed. I had changed too, but I didn’t know the man I’d become. Maybe the meds the
doctor prescribed would help my brain heal and I’d eventually remember my life. But where would that
leave me and Heather if I did?
Chapter Twenty-Five
CHARLIE
My senses were awakening even though our bedroom was completely dark, maybe still the middle of
the night. Feeling my body pressed up against Mitch, relief surged through me. My dreams, or should I say
nightmares, had been so vivid and heartbreaking. Right now, I just wanted to love him and know he was
mine. All mine. His back was to me and my arm was wrapped around his torso. Beginning to stroke his
taut abs, I heard him moan slightly. Hearing his guttural sound, I reached down farther and found his
hardened shaft through his underwear. He was ready.
Propping myself up, I put my hand on his shoulder, causing him to lie flat on his back. I tugged his
briefs off his body. Climbing on top of him, I leaned forward and began kissing him, rubbing my breasts
slightly against his chest. Moaning in Mitch’s mouth, I took the head of his shaft and began sliding it back
and forth against my clit. I was so wet and feeling a little wild for him. His head rubbing against me gave
me a slight pulsing sensation. Sounds of pleasure escaped each of us as he began slipping inside of me.
Slowly, I slid up and down, my nipples grazing over his chest. I loved having him inside of me. I was still
a little hazy from all the alcohol, but one thing I knew was how much I wanted him—the feel of his body,
his hands digging into my hips. Even when I was on top, he still liked to have a little control. I didn’t mind
because the things he did to my body were electrifying.
I sat back and Mitch’s big hands found my breasts. He pulled at my nipples, sending waves of pleasure
through my body. The throbbing between my legs was getting stronger and stronger. Mitch pinched and
pulled at my nipples as I moaned from his expert touch. Then, his mouth captured my right nipple,
scraping it with his teeth. He knew I was almost ready by my loud moan. Mitch rolled us over and he was
on top of me, thrusting inside me ever so slowly. His lips found mine, kissing me with so much passion. It
was like he had been dying to, but hadn’t had the chance. Moving down to my neck, he slid his tongue
along the spot that made my toes curl. He always knew just what to do and exactly how to do it. I loved
having his body connected to mine, his skin against mine, his hands and mouth roaming every inch of me. I
couldn’t help but scream out as an orgasm ripped through me. I didn’t know how it happened so fast, but it
was magnificent.
“Oh, God, baby,” I cried out. I could feel myself pulsating between my legs, squeezing him tightly.
I knew Mitch was getting close, feeling him slide in and out of me. His pace quickened, thrusting in
and out of me. Slamming into me. Fuck, he felt so good.
“Oh, baby, I’m gonna come again.” Another orgasm. “Your turn,” I said, tugging on his earlobe with my
teeth.
Mitch kept slipping in and out of me, faster and faster until his body collapsed onto me as he choked
out, “Charlie. You. Feel. So. Good. I love you so much.”
The whole world stopped the moment I heard…Garrett’s voice. I wasn’t making love to Mitch. Mitch
wasn’t in bed with me, coming inside of me. He was somewhere else and I wasn’t even in his memory
bank. Reality came crashing down around me, my heart sinking into the depths of my stomach.
“Oh my God. What have I done?” I practically yelled as I tried to move away from Garrett. He moved
off me quickly, clearly discerning how upset I was. I leaned over and turned on the lamp next to the bed.
“Charlie, it’s okay. You didn’t do anything wrong.”
“I didn’t…I didn’t do anything wrong? Are you kidding?” My heart was pounding so hard in my chest I
thought I would pass out. I couldn’t catch my breath. I was with my fiancé’s brother. I had cheated on
Mitch. “Shit. What have I done?”
I immediately put on my robe that was at the foot of the bed. Garrett stared at me wide-eyed, obviously
uncertain of what to do. It wasn’t his fault. I pushed him down, climbed on top of him and…I couldn’t
finish my own thought. I was disgusted with myself.
“Charlie,” Garrett said, reaching out toward me. “This isn’t your fault. I should have stopped you.
Don’t blame yourself for this.”
I had curled up into a ball on my bed and my back was to Garrett. He was trying so hard to console me.
But I didn’t want to be consoled. I didn’t deserve it.
“Charlie, please turn around and look at me. I need you to listen to me.”
I begrudgingly turned to look at Garrett. His eyes were full of concern and love for me. I could see
how hurt he was by me pulling away from him.
“Come here. Just let me hold you.” Tears streamed down my face as I moved toward Garrett. He
wrapped his muscular arms around me and held me tight. “You thought I was Mitch. You had a lot to drink
last night and when you got into bed, you asked me to stay, so I did. I couldn’t leave you. I wanna be here
for you, help you through this. Please don’t blame yourself. If you’re gonna be mad at someone, be mad at
me.”
In a very small voice, I asked, “Did you know I thought you were Mitch?” I was afraid of his answer.
“I was sleeping, so I wasn’t sure what was happening. But, I’m not gonna lie, I wanted you to want me.
I’ve loved you for so long and wanted to be with you, so part of me didn’t care who you thought I was.
I’m sorry for being such an ass, Charlie.”
“I know you’re just trying to be honest with me, but I just can’t take on your feelings right now. Maybe
it’d be best if you left. Everything that’s happening is just beyond what I can take.”
Garrett began to get up. “This isn’t happening. No, I’m not leaving. I’m not gonna leave you here
distraught like this. Don’t…don’t shut me out.”
“Garrett, don’t you get it? Everything’s fucked up beyond repair right now. I can’t return your feelings.
I’m devastated over Mitch. I care about you, but I love Mitch. I’ve planned out my whole life with him.
Now I’ve gone and done the unforgivable.”
“Charlie, give yourself a break. It’s not like you planned to do anything. You thought I was him. Damn
it,” Garrett said, running his hands through his hair. “What I’ve done is unforgivable. You must think I’m a
complete asshole for allowing this to happen.”
“I don’t even know what I think. I appreciate you being here for me, but I need to be alone to sort
things out.”
“Okay, I’ll go. But know one thing, Charlie: I’m not giving up without a fight.”
With those words coming across like a promise, Garrett walked out of my bedroom. I heard him shut
the front door as I was getting out of bed. What have I done? Shit. I cheated on Mitch. But, I couldn’t
deal with Garrett’s feelings for me. I was still too raw about Mitch leaving me.
I’m not giving up without a fight. A fight. He was right. I was blind to what Garrett felt for me, but it
was time to fight and stop feeling sorry for myself. I needed to fight for Mitch. I loved him and didn’t want
to accept his decision to leave me. Leave us. I needed information about Heather. I didn’t know her and
had no idea what I was dealing with. I knew she and Lillian were going to do everything in their power to
manipulate Mitch, and I wasn’t going to sit back and let that happen. He was worth fighting for. We were
worth fighting for. Even after what I just did.
Chapter Twenty-Six
MITCH
I’d taken another pill before going to bed, so I slept like a rock. It was almost ten when I opened my
eyes and looked at the clock. My body had needed the extra rest and I was beginning to feel better, at least
my head was. My emotions were another thing altogether. Last night, seeing Charlie, it felt like I was
supposed to be with her, even though I still had no memories of her. Hopefully, meeting with Kate would
give me the insight I needed. Being attuned to situations was something I remember coming naturally to
me, so being off like this was making me a little crazy.
My phone started ringing and I saw it was my girl calling.
“Hey, beautiful.”
“Hi yourself. How are you feeling this morning?”
“My head’s hurting less, so I’m getting better.”
“Oh, that’s so good, Mitch. I wanted to let you know the offer still stands for me to be there with you
when you talk to Kate. I can take a late lunch or just leave work early.”
“That’s really sweet of you to offer again, but I need to see her alone.”
“Well, if you just want to know about David, I can fill you in.”
“Heather, I’m meeting with Kate. I already told you last night I didn’t need you to go with me, and I
haven’t changed my mind. I’m a grown man and capable of talking to an old friend.” I heard Heather sigh.
“Heather, what’s your real issue here?”
“I’m concerned Kate’s gonna tell you all kinds of terrible things about me and tell you how wonderful
Charlie is.”
“Sweetie, you have nothing to worry about. I’m not gonna believe anything terrible about you. I know
you and I trust you.”
“Okay. Do you think you might wanna stay over at my place tonight?”
“Probably. I’ll let you know how I feel later. I just woke up and am starved. Can I call you later?”
“Yeah, I’ll talk to you then.”
I put my phone down on the nightstand. I didn’t remember Heather being this insecure. She seemed
very concerned about what Kate was going to say. It made me start to wonder what I’d be learning from
Kate this afternoon—she’d know the truth. I’d known and trusted Kate for so long, in my heart, so I’d
listen carefully to what she did and didn’t say.
Making my way to the kitchen, I found my mom pouring a cup of coffee. “Would you like some
coffee?” she asked.
“Yeah. That sounds like a good start.”
“How about I fix you breakfast and you can tell me all about going to dinner with Heather last night.”
“Sure,” I said, finding a banana to tide me over while I waited for breakfast.
My mom began cracking eggs and cooking bacon. “So, where did you go for dinner?”
“Some Italian restaurant. I can’t recall the name.”
“That doesn’t matter. Was it good?”
“The food was, and we ran into Kate and her husband.”
“Kate’s married now. Well, I hope she’ll be happy.” My mom had a way of saying things to have more
than one meaning.
“Why wouldn’t she be happy?”
“Guilt has a way of eating at your happiness.”
“I’m going to see her this afternoon, so I’ll find out how she’s doing. And what do you mean by guilt?”
“I hate to be the one to tell you this, honey, but Kate is the reason David is dead.”
“How could Kate be the reason David’s dead?”
“He answered her text while driving to get her and he crashed, dying instantly. David’s mom didn’t let
Kate attend his funeral and she’s never spoken to Kate again.”
I let my mother’s words sit with me for a moment. Could this be true? Is she the reason I lost my best
friend? Now talking to her was even more urgent.
“I’ll let Kate tell me about what happened. She’s going to pick me up so we can have some time
together.”
“Do you really think that’s a good idea? Maybe it’d be better to hear her news here so if you get tired
you can just rest.”
“We’re going out for coffee mom, not to run a marathon.”
My mom nodded. She pushed her agenda, but somewhere along the line I’d started standing up to her.
She knew when to give up.
Two arrived faster than I expected. Seeing Kate was going to be helpful, I hoped. For some strange
reason, an alarm sounded in my head when both Heather and my mother wanted to have some control over
my time with Kate.
The doorbell rang and before I could get it, my mom was greeting Kate.
“It’s so lovely to see you, dear. I hear you’re married. Congratulations.”
“Thank you,” said Kate. “I couldn’t be happier.”
“I can tell. You have a radiant glow about you.”
“Kate, thanks for coming. Mom, I’ll see you later,” I said, giving her a kiss on the cheek.
“Did you remember to take your pill?” my mother asked.
“Yes, I just took it. See ya later, Mom,” I said a little more forcefully now.
With that, I whisked Kate out the door before my mom could invite her in for coffee or a piece of pie. I
wanted our conversation to be just between us.
“Your mom’s looking well,” Kate said politely.
That was something I remembered about her. She was always classy and cordial. David is—shit—
David had been so lucky to have her.
“Yeah, she works at staying fit. She’s at the gym for hours some days.”
“Well, all her hard work is paying off.” We were approaching Kate’s car. “I thought we could go to my
house. We can relax, talk, have coffee or tea. I’ve got all kinds of snacks. How does that sound?”
“That’d be great. I need a quiet environment right now. Restaurants can be so loud.”
On the drive over to Kate’s, we engaged in small talk. She told me about her wedding, even though I
had been there. It seemed so bizarre to me that she was married to someone other than David. I just
couldn’t picture it. Any of it. But I wanted to hear what she had to say. Actually, I needed to hear it. Kate
knew everything that happened over the last seven years.
“We’re here.”
“Wow, Kate. Looks like you’ve married well.”
“Neil is wealthy. We bought this house right after we got married. It’s taking some getting used to,
since I was raised in a small condo. He’s so good to me, Mitch. I’m a very lucky woman.”
We walked through the intricately carved double doors into the main room. I could see straight through
the house to the ocean view.
“We can sit in here and I’ll open up the terrace doors if you like. It’s a beautiful afternoon. We’ll be
able to hear the ocean.”
“Yeah, I like that idea.” I sat where she directed me while she went into the kitchen to get us coffee. By
the aroma, I could tell she’d made it before leaving to pick me up.
Kate placed a tray with coffee, cream, and sugar on the coffee table. She sat beside me and we both
added in our favorite sweeteners to our coffees.
“So, how are you feeling, physically?” she asked.
“I’m feeling good overall. I have a headache now and then, but I take my meds and it goes away.”
“That’s good. I’m sure you want things back to normal as soon as possible.”
“Yeah, whatever normal is. I need you to shed some light on my life, starting with David.”
Kate nodded and took a sip of her coffee. “It seems like a lifetime ago, but I will tell you everything
you wanna know.”
“I was pretty blown away when Garrett told me David had died. I kind of know what happened, but I
really wanna hear it from you.”
Kate had a grave expression on her face as she was readying herself to tell me. “David and I had
decided it was time in our relationship to get married. We loved each other so much. You and Charlie
were very supportive of our decision. He’d rented an apartment near San Diego State so we could finish
school and work our jobs. He was such an old-fashioned kind of guy, so living together was out of the
question. We had a plan to get married at the Justice of the Peace. You and Charlie were meeting us there
to be our witnesses. No one else knew about our elopement.”
Kate stopped for a moment to catch her breath. She swallowed hard and her eyes glistened. I reached
out and put my hand on hers. “It’s okay, take your time.”
“I’m sorry. It’s taken me years to let go of what happened. To accept it.”
“Years, huh?” I asked, wishing I were caught up with everything.
“We were all devastated by what happened. For a long time I blamed myself.”
I continued staring at Kate, willing her to go on, giving her a slight nod.
“David was running late and I was growing impatient. Finally, I texted him to find out when he’d be
picking me up. I was an anxious bride, waiting for my groom. In the middle of him texting me back, he hit
the median and his car flipped several times. He was dead before the ambulance could get him to the
hospital. I found out what happened when a nurse pried David’s cell from his hand and she called me. I
thought it was some sick joke at first, but it was real. David was gone.”
Tears welled up in my eyes. “I hate this, not remembering and having to relive what I’ve already
accepted. I can’t believe he’s gone. We were so close…since elementary school.”
“I know. Some days I still wake up and for a brief moment I think about calling him. Until Neil came
along, I didn’t let anyone get close to me. It felt like a betrayal to be with someone else, even though I
can’t go back and change anything. I spent a lot of time in therapy to let go of the guilt I felt over his
accident.”
“So, you felt like it was your fault…that he died?”
“Yeah, if only I hadn’t texted him. David would still be alive and we’d be together.”
I thought about her statement for a moment. When my mom blamed Kate earlier this morning, I felt
some anger toward her. But now, just compassion. “Kate, it was an accident, just like me falling off the
ladder. No one made it happen. It just did.”
Kate looked at me with such gratitude in her eyes. “You said basically the same thing back then. You
never blamed me even though you could have.”
“David would want you to have a great life. He was so crazy about you.”
“I was crazy about him too. You know, back then, I couldn’t have gotten through this without you and
Charlie.” Kate wiped some tears away from her eyes.
“I hope talking about this isn’t too much for you. We’ve known each other for a long time and other
than family, you’re the only other person who can fill in the blanks.”
“Of course, Mitch. I wanna help you any way I can. I can’t imagine how frustrating it must be to not
remember.”
“Yes, it is. I feel like I’ve made impulsive decisions because of my memory loss. Without even
thinking, I broke up with Charlie and went back to Heather. I’m not even sure how it happened. It’s like a
tidal wave has crashed over my life and I’m holding onto a raft, trying not to drown.”
“Well, you’ve made decisions based on what you know. But, you’re missing a lot of information…
important information.”
“Okay, so why did Heather and I break up? Can you tell me that?”
“You never fully disclosed what happened between you two back then. You just kept saying what she
did was unforgivable. That you were moving forward and never looking back. I assumed maybe she
cheated on you, but I never knew for sure and as far as I know, you didn’t tell David either. You were very
angry though and you told her to stay out of your life for good.”
“I guess I need my brother to fill me in. I would imagine I told him exactly what happened. He and I
have been on the outs, which I didn’t know, so I’m not sure how much help he’ll be.”
“All you can do is ask him. Maybe he’ll surprise you,” Kate said.
“Maybe. So, how do you know Charlie? Is she a good person? I guess that’s a stupid question. I
wouldn’t be with her if she wasn’t a good person.”
“Mitch, Charlie is the best person I know. She’s been there for me through everything. We were friends
in middle school, but not high school because she moved. We became friends again the summer before our
freshman year at SDSU.”
“Okay. Tell me about Charlie and me together.”
“Your relationship is the strongest one I know. You adore her, and Mitch, she loves you something
fierce. You two were meant for each other from the moment you met.”
I couldn’t help but smile at Kate. She was how I remembered her and she was in my corner. Her love
and support for me was oozing from her pores. “How did we meet?”
“We all had a class together and you met her on the first day of school. She was dating some terrible
guy named Eric, who she wanted to get away from, but of course he’d signed up for the same classes she
had. He was controlling and manipulative, but you got in his way. Charlie broke up with him after class
and you were there to make sure it stuck. I watched as you did what you do best. You protected her from a
bad guy and I think she loved you from that moment. You two have been inseparable since then.” Eric.
Obviously not the Eric I met at the pharmacy. He’d said we were friends.
“Wow, so you could see we were meant for each other on that first day?”
“Yes, the way you looked at each other was like watching a movie, the characters having an unspoken
connection. You two have that. She’s the one for you. You believed that so much you proposed to her and
you’re supposed to be married in a few weeks.”
“I know. She showed me the proposal on her phone. I could see how happy she was to say yes.”
“She was beyond happy. I know you remember Heather, but is there any way you could spend some
time with Charlie, get to know her before you make decisions that change everything? What have you got
to lose?”
Heather came to mind. I could lose her if I spent time with Charlie, but everything Kate was saying
made sense. I had asked Charlie to marry me. Obviously, I believed she was the one. And obviously, at
some point before I met Charlie, I’d realized Heather wasn’t. “You’re right. I’ve been rash. All I can
remember is Heather. But if I broke up with her once, it would’ve been for a good reason. And you say I
said it was unforgivable? Then cheating sounds about right. I don’t have the last seven years’ worth of
adult understanding to apply to this, but it feels as though my mom is trying to control me or manipulate me
in some way. Both she and Heather were opposed to me talking with you. It’s confusing, Kate.”
“Mitch, you’re not the kind of guy to be controlled. Do you want them to run your life or do you want to
decide for yourself what’s right for you?”
Kate sat there waiting for my answer. I knew she was right and some hard decisions were ahead of me.
“Kate, you’re right. I don’t wanna be controlled. Does Charlie ever try to control me?”
Kate giggled. “No, I’d say Charlie’s a very strong woman, but she lets you be the man. Her personality
complements yours; that’s why you put a ring on her finger. Before this accident, there wasn’t anything you
two wouldn’t do for each other.”
I put my hand on my forehead, recalling what a douche I’d been to her when I went over to get my
things.
Kate put her hand on my shoulder. “What is it? What’s wrong?”
“I was a cruel ass when I went over with Heather and picked up my stuff, breaking up with Charlie.”
“She’s gonna forgive you. She knows you’re not yourself right now.”
“You think?”
“I know. She loves you.”
I nodded. “Yeah, I saw it in her face when she visited me in the hospital.”
“So, what are you gonna do? You have two choices. You can go back to the safe haven of the past, or
you can take a risk on what I know will be an amazing future.”
“You’ve given me a lot to think about. I don’t know what I’m gonna do right now, but thanks for this
afternoon. I’m probably gonna need more days like today.”
“I’m here for you. Anything you need, anytime you need it. I want you to be happy and I believe in my
heart your happiness is with Charlie.”
The afternoon had faded and early evening was settling in. Kate was driving me home when I realized
I wanted to see Charlie. I wanted to spend some time with her and I didn’t want my mom or Heather to
interfere.
Chapter Twenty-Seven
CHARLIE
I’d spent most of my day attempting to wrap my mind around what’d happened with Garrett. I had
cheated on Mitch and that was worse than him not remembering me. How was I going to face him? Would
he understand if I told him? What if Garrett told him first and Mitch never forgave me? The bleakness of
the situation shrouded me in darkness, but I had…I had to figure this out. I had to get Mitch back and it
was time to stop being pushed around by Lillian and Heather.
My mom had called me to check in. I couldn’t face her either with what I’d done. I told her I was
planning on staying at my place and just taking some time for myself to sort through things. She seemed to
understand and made it clear I could come home any time I wanted. I loved her so much. She’d always
been there for me and had a way of letting me make my own decisions without interference or judgment.
Occasionally, she gave guidance, but she was confident in the job she and my dad did raising me. We had
a great relationship.
I hadn’t eaten all day and had virtually no food in the house, so I decided to go get some Mexican food.
I drove down to a local place to get a chicken burrito. As I walked into the restaurant, I felt a familiar
presence in the air. An evil presence…Eric. He was standing behind me in line; I could tell by his
cologne. Knowing there was no way around this, I glanced back and sure enough, there he was.
“Charlie, it’s so good to see you,” he said in a delighted voice.
“Hi Eric,” I managed. I was less than enthusiastic to see him. My skin was crawling and my appetite
was plummeting.
“How are you and Mitch doing? I saw his mom at the pharmacy a few days ago.”
So, Eric had found out Mitch and I were no longer together. He’d already found me and was swooping
in. Typical…and unnerving.
“Well, all relationships go through challenges. We’re working it out.”
“Oh, then the girl I saw him with is out of the picture?”
It was my turn to order, so I didn’t have to answer Eric’s question, thank God. I placed my order and
moved out of the way to wait for my food. Please God, let them make it quickly.
Within seconds, Eric was standing next to me waiting for his food too. “So, what are you up to
nowadays, Eric?” I asked, attempting to steer the conversation away from me and Mitch.
“I’m a pharmacist at Walgreens. That’s where I saw Mitch, his mom, and his girlfriend.”
“I see,” I said, nodding slowly.
“You know, Charlie, I’ve really changed since we were together. I went to anger management classes
and I don’t have to control women anymore. I’m really sorry for everything I put you through back then,”
he said with a sincerity I didn’t quite believe. Control and abuse were in his nature and him breaking free
of that would’ve taken a miracle.
“Thank you for the apology, Eric. I really appreciate it,” I said, with a forced smile.
“Do you think there’s any chance we could go out for coffee or something?”
“I don’t think so. I have so much going on right now; I’m not up for getting together. I hope you can
understand.”
“Oh, sure. Maybe down the line when things settle down for you.”
“Maybe.” They called my number and my food was ready. I’d never wanted to get out of a place so
much in my life. Just standing in his presence gave me the chills. And there was no way on God’s green
earth I was getting together with him. Ever.
“Well, I’m gonna go. Have a good evening.”
“You too, Charlie. I’m sure we’ll be seeing each other around.”
My heart was heavy when I entered my townhouse alone. My plan was to eat my dinner and watch
some mindless TV so I wouldn’t have to think about…anything. Especially what I’d done with Garrett. I
took a few bites of my food, but thoughts of what a horrible person I was kept flooding my mind. Wishing
I could rewind time, I put my burrito in the fridge so I could eat it tomorrow. I’d lost my appetite thanks to
my own blatant selfishness.
I knew Natalie would be back in a few days from her honeymoon and I hoped she and Kate could
maybe spend an evening with me devising a “get rid of Heather” plan. All sorts of things were going
through my mind when I heard a knock on my door.
I got up quietly and looked through the peephole. I didn’t like to answer the door when I was home
alone. To my surprise, it was Mitch on the other side.
“What are you doing here?” I asked as soon as I opened the door. Kate was standing next to him with a
compassionate look on her face.
“I spent some time with Kate today and decided I wanted to see you. Can I come in?”
“Of course,” I said, beginning to shake on the inside. I hoped Mitch couldn’t see it or hear it in my
voice.
“I’m gonna take off. I just wanted to make sure you were here before I left. Can you take Mitch home?”
“Absolutely,” I said to Kate. Then I mouthed “Thank you” to her. She nodded and left. I guess I was
going to find out if Kate had gotten through to him.
“Make yourself comfortable. Do you want something to drink?” I didn’t know what else to say. My
guilt was making me rigid…nervous…freaked out.
“Water would be great.”
I walked into the kitchen to get water for each of us. I didn’t know if I should be ecstatic or scared to
death he was here. I returned with the water and sat beside him.
“How are you feeling?”
“I wish I knew. It seems like I don’t know…I’m in unchartered waters trying to find my way.”
“I’m so sorry you’re going through all of this,” I said, attempting to be cognizant of what I said. I didn’t
want to do or say anything to scare Mitch away. Then my mind flashed back to this morning. I hated
myself for what I had done.
“After talking to Kate, I realized we are going through this. Not just me.”
I took in a deep breath, hoping this was the beginning of our way back to each other. I wanted to reach
out and touch him, but I decided to wait. Maybe he’d take my hand. A girl could hope. “This is a lot to go
through.” I sighed.
“It is, but I treated you pretty badly yesterday when I came over with Heather.”
“It’s okay. She’s who you remember,” I said, my stomach in knots just thinking about him breaking up
with me.
“I think it’s more than that. I felt riled up for some reason. Everything’s just distorted right now. But
being here with you has a familiar feeling.”
“It does?” I asked, trying not to leap into his arms. Hope was beginning to well up inside me.
“Yes. It’s easy to be with you. I don’t feel like I have to put forth a lot of effort.”
I nodded, too choked up to say anything. Mitch put his hand on mine and all I could do was just stare
into his eyes. Then he picked it up and looked at the ring he’d given me.
“Did we set a date?” he asked, continuing to look at my ring.
“We were gonna get married on February 22nd.”
“It’s January now, right?”
“Yes.”
“I think I’m gonna need a little more time. I hope you understand.” Then he gave me his sexy grin. The
same smile that made me weak in the knees. I wanted to climb on top of him and start kissing him, but I
didn’t.
“What are you saying?”
“I’d like to have the chance to get to know you again and hopefully my memory will come back in the
process.”
“I’d love that. I know this must be so hard for you, Mitch, and I won’t put any pressure on you. Of
course…well…of course I want you back. I love you. But it’s completely okay to take it one day at a time.
I’m just glad you want to…try.”
“You’re so understanding,” he said, putting his hand to his head.
“Are you okay?” I asked, wanting to do anything, anything at all, to make things better.
“My head is throbbing. I need to take my meds and eat something. I hate to cut this short, but I need to
go home.”
“Of course. You need to rest. I’ll get my keys.”
As I drove him home, Mitch held my hand. It felt so good to be connected to him, even if it was in this
tiny way. I wasn’t sure what was going to happen, but at least he hadn’t written me off. I pulled up in front
of his parents’ house, but didn’t turn off my car.
“So, how about we do something on Friday night? I probably need low-key, but I’d like to see you.”
“Why don’t you come over? We can have dinner and just hang out.”
“Perfect. How about six?”
“Okay.”
“I’ll see you then,” he said, as he began opening his car door.
“See you then.”
I sat there for a moment, everything overwhelming me. My emotions today had been like a
rollercoaster. I felt like an emotional wreck.
Chapter Twenty-Eight
MITCH
Walking into the house, I could hear my mom and Heather talking. I had ignored their texts and calls
that had seemed to come at me like rapid fire all day.
“I’m home,” I called out.
“We were beginning to get worried,” my mother said as she began walking toward me. “Have you
been with Kate all this time?”
“I was with Kate for the afternoon, but she dropped me off at Charlie’s house. I needed to talk to her.”
The sour look on my mom’s face said it all. “I see,” she said bitterly.
“Why did you need to talk to Charlie?” Heather asked.
I looked at both of them, staring at me, waiting for answers. They were both intelligent women. They
should’ve known why. I was engaged to Charlie, and had been dating her for seven years. “Right now, I
just wanna take my meds and eat something. I’m not up for any more talking.”
My mom crossed her arms over her chest. She wasn’t happy, but she didn’t say anything. Neither did
Heather. I kind of expected her to leave, but she didn’t. Instead, she followed me to the kitchen and
watched me make a turkey sandwich. My head was hurting so much, I took two of my pills, hoping relief
would find me.
“So, what happened with Charlie?” Heather asked as I ate my last bite.
Answering her question wasn’t at the top of my list. “Why did we break up?”
“What does that have to do with Charlie?”
“We’re not discussing Charlie. I wanna know why we broke up.”
The sigh escaping Heather’s mouth was much louder than I thought possible. Tears filled her eyes and
one rolled down her cheek.
“Do you promise to hear me out without getting mad?”
“I can try, but I can’t make any promises. I need you to tell me, or I’ll find out from someone else.”
Heather seemed to mull over what I was saying and I knew someone besides us had the info I was
looking for. If she wouldn’t tell me, then I’d get it out of Garrett.
“It was right after graduation and I hadn’t been feeling well. I thought it was because of stress of finals,
graduating, getting ready for college. But it wasn’t. I was pregnant.”
“You got pregnant? Did you have a miscarriage?”
“When I found out I was pregnant, I freaked out. I wasn’t ready to have a baby or be a mother. I
assumed you’d agree with me that an abortion was the only thing that made sense for us. We were too
young to be parents.”
“Did I agree?” I asked, knowing what my current answer would be. No.
“No, you said you loved me and we could work it out. We’d get help from your parents and find a
way.”
I had to tell myself to stay calm. Rage was welling up inside of me as I gritted my teeth together.
“What. Happened. Heather? Did you—”
“I went to a clinic and had an abortion without you knowing. Then I lied and told you I had a
miscarriage. You believed me until Garrett started dating my best friend and she ended up telling him.
He’s the one who told you the truth.”
Heather laid her head on the table and began sobbing. Her shoulders were shaking and soft cries
escaped her throat.
I sat there dumbfounded, not knowing what to do. I had an ache in my heart from where she just
dropped her bomb. Comforting her would’ve been a nice gesture, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it.
Now I understood why I had told Kate that Heather had done something unforgivable. She not only went
behind my back, but she lied to me about it.
Heather picked up her head. “Mitch, I’m so sorry. I was young and stupid. Please forgive me for
ruining what we had together.”
I still couldn’t speak. This was as painful as falling off the ladder. My body was racked with despair. I
sat there thinking about how I was twenty-five and I should be mature, but I really wanted to scream at her
and punch some holes in the wall.
Stay calm. Stay calm. “I think I need a little bit of time to digest what you’ve just told me. It’d be good
for you to go home and give me some space. I’ll call you when I’m ready.”
“Oh, Mitch. Please don’t shut me out. Tell me how you feel.”
“You wanna know how I feel?” I asked, standing up from my chair so quickly it made a loud screech
across the floor. “I don’t think I can put into words for you how I’m feeling. I’ll talk to you when I’m
ready,” I said, turning to walk to my room. My mom said something to me, but I didn’t stop to answer her
or listen for that matter.
Closing the door behind me, I leaned against it for support. What else could happen? I couldn’t seem
to move as I put my head back. That’s when I heard them, my mother and Heather talking. Their voices
were low, but I could still make them out.
“You didn’t tell him everything, did you?” my mother asked.
“No, he has no idea you took me to have the abortion.”
“Thank you. If that ever came out, I don’t think he’d forgive me.”
“Well, I know you were just advising me as to what you thought was best, considering you had been in
my situation with Garrett.”
“You were smarter than me. You didn’t get married because you were pregnant. I wish I could say the
same.”
What the fuck? All the muscles in my body tensed up. My mother advised my girlfriend to have an
abortion and took her? She resented getting married and having a family?
“You have to make sure he never finds out the baby wasn’t his. You can still make this work, Heather.
Convince Mitch you were scared and felt you had no choice. Tell him you were thinking about his future.”
“Well, I was. I was terrified and Mitch couldn’t see it. He only considered the good things, not the
bad.”
“He’s always been an optimist. A dreamer.”
I couldn’t listen to any more. My mom. Was this why she didn’t like Charlie? Charlie didn’t strike me
as the sort of woman to be manipulated or controlled easily. What had Kate said? She’s strong but allows
me to be the man. Heather had cheated on me. What a bitch. I was right to leave her. Even if I didn’t get
my memory back, she wasn’t going to be part of my future. That was for certain.
I lay on my bed, putting the pillow over my head. Charlie’s face appeared in my mind. She looked so
beautiful tonight. I was grateful nothing more than kissing had happened between Heather and me. At least
there was that. I could look Charlie in the eye and truthfully tell her nothing had happened between
Heather and me.
Damn it, I wish these pills would work so I could remember the last seven years. I wanted back what
was mine in the worst way. I wondered where the hell Garrett was. I hoped we could talk openly and I
could figure out what his problem was with me. The only Garrett I knew was not just a brother, but my
best friend next to David.
David. Gone so soon. I wanted to scream, hit the wall, strangle my mother. All of this was beyond
fucked up. I was one giant, fucked-up mess.
I heard the front door close and knew Heather was gone. My mom did her standard two knocks and
then opened my bedroom door.
“Are you okay?” she asked with what I assumed was fake concern.
“I’ve been better.” I wasn’t in the mood to talk to her, look at her, breathe the same air as her. How had
my dad done it all these years? Oh, that’s right, by hiding in his office and never saying a word. Maybe I’d
take his lead for right now until I could get a grip on everything I’d learned today about my life.
“Well, I just wanted to check on you. Hearing about David and finding out Heather had an abortion,
you’ve had some blows today.”
“Yeah, I need to digest all of the information. It’s been overwhelming,” I said, doing everything in my
power not to get up and charge her. Keeping my mom in the dark gave me the upper hand in this situation.
She was way craftier than I’d ever imagined. How could she choose Heather over me? I was disgusted by
my own mother. It made me wonder what else she was capable of doing.
“Well, I’ll let you get some rest. Has any of your memory come back, spending time with Kate and
Charlie?”
“No.”
“Have you taken your pills?”
“I did. Good night,” I said curtly.
“Good night,” she said, quietly closing the door behind her.
Chapter Twenty-Nine
CHARLIE
I wasn’t ready to go home, so I texted Kate I was coming to her house. I needed to talk to her and not
on the phone. I also needed Neil’s advice about what I’d done.
As soon as Kate opened the door, I started talking.
“I don’t know what you said to him, but I think we have a chance to get our life back.”
“Oh, Charlie, I’m so glad.”
“We’re gonna see each other on Friday night. Who knows, maybe by then the meds will have helped. I
just need this nightmare to be over.” We sat on the sectional in her living room and Kate had a huge smile
on her face.
“Me too. I want this all to be over so we can get back to planning your wedding.”
“Thanks, Kate. I’m so grateful to have you. Thank you for getting through to Mitch,” I said, placing my
hand on hers.
“Of course. You two are meant for each other. I really believe it’s all gonna work out.”
“I hope so, but a couple of things have happened that I haven’t told you about.”
“Good things or bad things?”
“They’re both bad. I’m gonna need some advice from Neil. Is he home?”
“Yes, he’s in his office. I’ll get him.”
Kate went to get Neil and I contemplated what I was going to say. I knew Kate wouldn’t judge me, but
I didn’t know how Neil was going to react to my news. I hoped he’d be understanding and be able to tell
me what I should do.
“Charlie,” Neil said as they both returned. “It’s good to see you. Kate told me things are looking up.”
They both sat next to me holding hands. I was really anxious about telling them what I had done and my
stomach was twisted in knots. “I’m just gonna come right out with the first problem. Garrett stayed with
me last night and I had sex with him early this morning.”
“Oh Charlie, what?” Kate asked, her eyes widening.
Neil didn’t say anything.
“I thought he was Mitch. It was dark, I’d had so much to drink, and I really thought…” I couldn’t finish,
covering my mouth with my hand. My eyes filled with tears.
“How did you and Garrett leave things?” Neil asked.
“He wanted to comfort me, but I made him leave. He told me he’s in love with me.”
“Oh, shit. Charlie, this is a complication you just don’t need,” Kate interjected.
“I know. I’m so angry with myself. I shouldn’t have had so much to drink. But when I saw Mitch and
Heather, I had to drown the pain. I just couldn’t stand it. But all I managed to do was hurt Garrett and
possibly ruin my relationship with Mitch. I don’t know what to do.”
Kate and I both looked over at Neil, who sat there with his brow furrowed.
“I’m not going to lie to you. It won’t matter to Mitch that you thought it was him and not Garrett. You
slept with his brother. Chances are, he knows his brother has feelings for you. Mitch is really good at
reading people,” Neil said somberly.
“I know,” I said. “Should I tell him and beg his forgiveness?”
“Normally, I’d advise you not to say a word, but it’s all going to unravel if Garrett ends up telling
him.”
“I know. I need to talk to Garrett. I hope he understands.”
“Has Garrett had feelings for you for a long time?” Neil continued.
“Yes. Years.”
“Obviously Mitch doesn’t know right now, but I wonder if he knew before the accident.”
“I need to find that out. I’m gonna text Garrett and suggest we get together,” I said.
“Clearing the air would be really good right now. If he tells Mitch it’s going to be really bad. Mitch
might not forgive you.”
“Charlie, I’m so sorry all of this is happening. What’s the other bad thing you wanted to talk about? Is
it as bad as this?” Kate asked.
“I saw Eric.”
“No. Where did you see him?”
“Who’s Eric?” Neil asked.
“My abusive ex from high school. We broke up the day I met Mitch.”
Neil nodded.
“He was in line at the Mexican restaurant when I went to get dinner.”
“Did he see you? Talk to you?”
“Yes, we had a conversation. He knows about Mitch’s accident and that we aren’t together right now.”
“But…how?” Kate questioned.
“He’s the pharmacist where Mitch got his prescription filled. I guess Heather took him to get it and he
talked to Mitch. I was really stunned to see him and he asked me out for coffee, saying he’d been to anger
management classes.”
“What did you say?” Kate asked.
“I told him I couldn’t right now because there was too much going on.”
“What does your gut tell you? Do you think he was sincere?” Neil asked.
“I had the chills the entire time I was talking to him. I couldn’t wait to get away from him.”
“That’s bad, too. He didn’t follow you, did he?”
“I don’t think so, but I really have no idea. He’s very crafty.” Glancing at my phone, I realized it was
getting late. “I better go. It’s late.”
“Why don’t you come over for dinner tomorrow night and we can talk more?” Neil suggested.
“That’d be great,” I said, getting up. We said our goodbyes and I headed home. Just talking about what
had happened had drained all my energy. I was grateful neither Kate nor Neil had judged me for what I’d
done. I was the worst judge of myself anyway. I couldn’t take their anger too.
***
I wasn’t home for more than two minutes when I heard a knock. I walked to the door, looked through
the peephole, and saw Garrett staring back at me. Looks like we’d be clearing the air sooner than I
thought. I opened the door and let him in.
“Garrett. Come in. Beer?”
“I’d love a beer if you have it.”
“Coming right up.” This gave me a moment to gather my thoughts. The last thing I wanted was to hurt
Garrett. He’d always been so good to me. I felt ill both emotionally and physically. Talking just came
easily for us and I had shared so much with him and he with me before he did his disappearing act. I was
hoping we could have that kind of communication tonight.
Returning to the living room, I handed Garrett his beer and had one for myself. I needed something to
take the edge off and push my heart from my throat back down to my chest.
We had a long awkward pause, which screamed loud and clear just how uncomfortable we both were.
I took a long sip of my beer, hoping the liquid courage would give me some words.
“Have you talked to Mitch today?” I asked. Small talk sucked.
“I haven’t seen him. I needed time to think.”
I stared at Garrett. Hadn’t he come back to spend time with Mitch? Help him? I couldn’t stop my brow
from creasing. Why wasn’t he there for Mitch?
“Okay, I’m gonna come clean with you. I came back for you, Charlie. I’m not proud of myself, but I see
this as an opportunity for us.”
“Garrett, I appreciate your honesty, but I can’t consider us. I want my life back with Mitch.”
Garrett’s nostrils flared slightly. He seemed angry, but was controlling it rather well. “I know this is a
difficult time for you, but I think if you were honest with yourself you’d realize there’s always been a
spark between us.”
“Garrett,” I said, touching his arm. “If I’d met you first, things may have been different. But I met Mitch
first. I can’t explain why fate steered my life in the direction it has, but I’m engaged to your brother. I love
him.”
“But what if he never remembers? What if he stays with Heather?”
“I don’t know. I keep pushing those thoughts away and hoping he’ll come back to me. All of this just
happened a few days ago.”
“Charlie, I want you to leave Mitch and be with me. Come to New York and start a life with me. I love
you. I always have. Please give us a chance.”
“Garrett, I’m so flattered, really, I am. But I’m not leaving Mitch. What happened between us was a
mistake and I need you to forget all about it.”
“You mean, don’t tell Mitch,” he said gruffly.
“Yes. Please don’t tell Mitch. It’ll only hurt him and he doesn’t deserve that.”
“What about what I deserve? We can be happy together.”
“I’m sure we could under different circumstances, Garrett. You’re a wonderful man and I care about
you. I hope you can understand I didn’t do this with malice. I made a mistake.”
“You and I making love was not a mistake. It’s something I have wanted for a long time and I’ll never
accept it as a mistake.”
I didn’t know what else to say. I hated that my actions were hurting Garrett and I had a terrible feeling
he was going to tell Mitch no matter what I said. So, I just sat there staring at him because I couldn’t think
of anything else to do.
“Charlie, I can offer you so much. I wanna give you everything. You’re my everything,” he said,
moving toward me. He pulled my body close to his and held me. I could feel his heart beating rapidly
against mine. “Mitch is with Heather now and we have a chance to be happy together. Don’t throw it
away,” Garrett said softly in my ear.
Garrett seemed unreasonable and I knew I wasn’t going to convince him to keep this a secret. Dread
spread over me like a wet blanket, chilling me to the bone. I wasn’t sure how to handle Garrett, as he was
being so assertive. I’d never seen him this way.
After a few moments, Garrett pulled back and looked into my eyes. “Just give us a chance. Let me hold
you and make you feel safe.”
“Garrett, I can’t. I made a promise to marry Mitch and I wanna keep my promise. I’m sorry.”
“You mean you won’t. You can do anything you want.”
“You’re right, I won’t.”
Garrett got up without another word. He walked out the door, without glancing back. I had hurt him.
Shit. For all I knew, he’d be telling Mitch the moment they saw each other.
I lay on my sofa wondering how over the past few days my entire life had imploded. Mitch was going
to be so angry when he found out, and who could blame him? I texted him to see if he was awake,
desperate to tell him myself, but he didn’t reply. I knew showing up at his house would cause a giant
scene and Lillian would get in the middle and make things even worse. I could only hope Mitch was
asleep and I could talk to him before Garrett did. But somehow, given how things had been going, it
seemed unlikely.
Chapter Thirty
MITCH
I’d been in my room since Heather left. Going out and facing my mother was more than I could stand,
and as far as I knew Garrett wasn’t home. Then, I heard a knock on the door. Begrudgingly, I got up to
open it, thinking my mother was on the other side. But it was Garrett.
“Man, I’m glad to see you. We really need to catch up.”
“Yeah, that’s the plan. You feeling okay?”
“Yeah. My head still hurts at the point of impact, and the headaches come and go.” “Great. I thought if
you were up for it we could go shoot some hoops down at the park.”
“Let’s do it. I need to get some fresh air.”
“Mind if I borrow a pair of shorts and a shirt? I only brought a limited amount of clothes.”
“Sure,” I said, turning to open my dresser drawer. I handed Garrett a pair of black shorts and a longsleeved
blue shirt.
“Get ready and I’ll meet you out front. Let’s be quiet and not wake up Mom.”
“Okay, see you in a minute.” Garrett closed the door and I began changing. Shooting hoops was one of
our favorite things to do together. Just like old times. Even though it felt like we had done it last week, not
years ago. Spending time with him was what I needed.
I met my brother on the front porch like we always did when we snuck out to play basketball. Mom
never knew…it was our secret. Doing this made me feel more like myself again and I was grateful for the
chance to pick Garrett’s brain.
We began walking toward the park and Garrett was pretty quiet.
“So, do you know why I broke up with Heather after graduation?” I asked.
“I’m afraid so.”
“Is that why you were cold toward her at the hospital?”
“Yeah. She didn’t treat you very well back then, but she seems to be better now. Are you two gonna
make a go of it?”
I was surprised at his cavalier attitude. If he knew she’d cheated, lied, and aborted what I thought had
been my child, why would I make things work with her now? Surely he’d know I hated deception. That
wasn’t a new thing, right? Something’s weird. I was going to get to the bottom of this if it took all night.
“Do you think I should make things work out with her?” I asked, realizing I had to be just as careful
with Garrett as I did with my mother. It was becoming exhausting feeling like I couldn’t trust my own
family.
“Well, you do love her, she’s who you remember, and she’s really trying hard to be there for you.”
He wasn’t giving me the answer I expected to hear. I assumed he’d advocate for Charlie and I to be
together. She was my fiancée, after all. “Well, Heather has a lot of great qualities. Do you think she has
my best interest at heart?”
“I actually really do, bro. She does love you even though she made mistakes in the past. Maybe this is
your second chance.”
I wanted to tell him that he was fucked in the head if he thought I was going to be with Heather, but I
didn’t. My gut was telling me there was more to the story. “What about Charlie, then?”
“I think you should tell her to move on with her life. She deserves better than waiting around for you to
remember her, don’t you think?”
By now we were at the court and Garrett began bouncing the ball. With each sound of the bounce, my
head hurt and my anger grew. He wanted my girl and he was disguising it as concern for me when he was
just really concerned for himself. What the fuck! I seemed to be having an out-of-body experience.
Everything was sideways.
“So, then Charlie should end up with you, right bro?” My tone was biting, and I was readying myself
for a fight. The fight of my life.
Garrett stopped bouncing the ball and just stared at me for a moment. “Yeah, she should. You have
Heather and I’ll take care of Charlie.”
“Wow, you’ve got it all wrapped up in a nice, neat package, don’t you?”
“Mitch, I didn’t plan any of this, but I can’t say I’m unhappy that I could be with Charlie. I love her and
always have.”
Shooting hoops wasn’t going to be happening. “What’s happened? You obviously have something else
to tell me. Why would you think Charlie would give up on me and go with you?”
“When Charlie saw you with Heather at the Italian restaurant, she got pretty lit. She was upset, so I
stayed with her.”
“What do you mean, you stayed with her?”
Garrett just raised his eyebrow and gave me a look.
“In our bed?”
“Yes. During the night, she reached out to me and we made love.”
“You fucked my fiancée?” I practically shouted. “What the fuck were you thinking, Garrett? How could
you betray me like this?”
“Look, my desire and love for her were more important than my loyalty to you. I’m sorry. I’ve been in
love with her for years. Plus, you dumped her for Heather.”
“But that doesn’t make it right, you asshole.”
I lunged at Garrett, catching him off guard, knocking him down to the ground.
“You son of a bitch. I should kill you for this,” I shouted in his face. Garrett pushed me off and got up.
My head was pounding, adrenaline surging through me. We were both fighting for the same woman, and I
was going to be damned if he was going to take Charlie away from me. What the—? I’m fighting to keep
Charlie? Is this why he left in the first place? He was in love with her and couldn’t have her?
I delivered a right hook, hitting Garrett in the eye. He took my punch, but gave me an uppercut to the
ribs.
“She wants me, Mitch. You’ve already lost her. I don’t wanna have to beat you within an inch of your
life. You can have Heather.”
All I could see was red. I picked up my brother and slammed him to the ground. Then I got on top of
him and started pummeling his face. That bastard wasn’t taking Charlie from me.
Garrett turned us over and had me pinned, paying back what I’d just done to him. I could feel my face
being shredded with each blow he delivered. I had to play this dirty to get out from under him, so I
grabbed his balls and squeezed as hard as I could. He screamed out and fell over.
He was crawling away from me and I had my hands on my knees, attempting to catch my breath. My
vision was blurry and Garrett was spitting out blood when they showed up. What had begun as a fight
between brothers turned into something else entirely.
Chapter Thirty-One
CHARLIE
Sweat had beaded upon my brow as I awoke from my dream. The guilt from having sex with Garrett
was wreaking havoc on my mind. Mitch knowing what I’d done would be the undoing of our fragile
relationship, but stopping Garrett was beyond my control. Everything about this was now beyond my
control. All I could see was the hurt that was going to be on Mitch’s face when Garrett told him. I had no
doubt whatsoever Garrett was going to tell—it was just a matter of when. This mistake was going to haunt
me for the rest of my life.
Sitting up, I decided I’d sleep the rest of the night in bed, rather than on the sofa. That’s when I heard it.
The jiggling of the doorknob. Someone was outside my door. Fear shot through my body and I tiptoed to
the door to look through the peephole. Maybe it was Garrett and I didn’t have to freak out. But if it
wasn’t…Someone was trying to break in. My mind went blank. I didn’t know what I was going to do if
someone got into my townhouse.
All I could make out was that it was a man. He was wearing some sort of ski hat on his head and I
knew it wasn’t Garrett or anyone I knew. Why I thought it’d be Garrett at two in the morning was
completely stupid. Panic was setting in.
I ran to the kitchen and grabbed a butcher knife out of the block. If he got through the lock, I’d stab him
before he broke the chain. It was the only thing I could think of. So I stood there, watching, listening,
waiting…scared shitless. I had a plan, but didn’t know if I could follow through with it. But, my years of
taking marital arts in college came rushing back to me and calm spread over me. I could hear my teacher’s
voice telling me to breathe and strike hard. Within seconds, the door was ajar and the chain was the only
thing between me and my assailant. The ski mask was pulled over his face, so I had no idea who I was
about to stab. Holding the knife firmly, I jabbed it through the six-inch space and hit my target.
“Son of a bitch!” he yelled out.
I retracted and stabbed again. And again. And again. Each time he yelled out. I kept the knife in my
hand and grabbed my cell phone, dialing 911.
“911, what’s your emergency?”
“A man is trying to break into my townhouse and I just stabbed him! Please…I need the police.”
“Is he inside?”
“No. I stabbed him before he broke the chain on the door. But he’s trying to break the door down by
ramming into it. They need to hurry.”
“You stupid bitch. I’m coming for you!” he screamed at me.
“You need to get away from the door and lock yourself in another room. Tell me your address.”
I rattled off my address as I ran down the hall. I locked my bedroom door and then went into the
bathroom and locked that door. “Okay,” I said huffing, “I’ve locked myself in my bathroom. Are the police
coming?”
“Yes. They’ll be there in five minutes. I’m Gina. Tell me your name.”
“Charlie.”
“Stay on the phone with me, Charlie. I’m going to be right here with you until the police arrive. Do you
still have the knife?”
“Yes.”
“Do you hear him in your place?”
At that moment, I heard a crashing sound, like glass breaking. “Where are you, you fucking bitch?” he
ranted.
“He’s inside. He’s breaking things. How much longer?”
“Three minutes, Charlie. Stay quiet. Are your lights on?”
“Yes.”
“Turn them off. If he breaks through the door, you’re going to need to be able to see him before he sees
you.”
“Okay,” I whispered. Getting up to turn off the bathroom light, I could hear him beating against my
bedroom door. Tears streamed down my cheeks knowing he’d be at my bathroom door in no time.
“Is he getting closer, Charlie?”
“Yes,” I whispered.
The moment of truth had arrived. The bathroom doorknob was turning and he was banging his body
against the door. I braced my feet against the door, pushing with all my might.
“Open this door,” he commanded. That’s when I knew who he was. I finally recognized his voice.
“Or what, Eric?” I yelled back.
“I know who he is…Eric Machado, an old boyfriend,” I told Gina.
“Are you sure?”
“Yes, I recognize his voice.”
“Who the hell are you talking to?”
“911. The police will be here any second.”
Everything went silent, except for the pounding of footsteps. He was running away and I could hear the
sirens coming toward me.
“What’s happening, Charlie?”
“I think he’s leaving,” I gasped out. My voice became high pitched and I couldn’t control it.
“Are you hurt in any way?”
I turned the bathroom light back on. “My arm is bleeding. I scraped it while stabbing him through the
door.”
“Are the lacerations deep?”
“I think so. I’m bleeding a lot.”
“Do you have someone who can take you to the hospital?”
“No.” I was beginning to feel faint. A knock on the door grabbed my attention.
“Miss, it’s Officer Sanders with San Diego PD. Are you all right?”
Beginning to unlock the door, I dropped my phone and fell to the floor. “I think I need…I need help.”
The officer pushed the door open and I gazed up at him. He took the towel hanging on the rack and
began to apply pressure to my arm as I faded out.
Chapter Thirty-Two
MITCH
As I lay on the cold hard ground, searing pain shot through my body. What had begun as my brother and
I beating the shit out of each other turned into us attempting to fend off four young thugs. They appeared
out of nowhere and had caught us off guard. I’d like to think we’d done our best defending ourselves, but
one punch and I was knocked out. The odds were against us since we were outnumbered and had already
been beating on each other. Garrett was lying a few feet away and wasn’t making a sound. He was so
still…so quiet.
“Garrett. Can you hear me?” Nothing. He was motionless and I knew he was hurt pretty badly. The
gang had used the playground equipment as weapons. At one point, I think he’d been choked with the
chains from the swings. What if they killed him? No, no. It can’t be that bad.
Sirens blared in the background. Hopefully someone had the good sense to call the police or an
ambulance. We both needed help desperately. At least we had ended up near the basketball court and
there was some light so we could be seen.
After zoning out for I don’t know how long, I heard voices.
“Sir, are you okay? Can you hear me?”
I tried to say yes in my normal voice, but I couldn’t, so I reached out with my hand.
“Okay Shane, this one is conscious. How’s your guy over there?”
“Unconscious. Looks like he’s lost a lot of blood.”
I kept my eyes on the officer. “We have two ambulances coming. They’ll be here any minute. Just try to
relax. Do you have any identification on you?”
I shook my head. No ID but I had my phone. Never left home without it. I motioned to my pocket,
hoping that in the fight it hadn’t been broken. The officer pulled it out and said, “I’m going to say names
and you nod if that’s who you want me to call.” I nodded. When he said Charlie’s name, I nodded again.
The officer called her. “No one’s answering. I’ll keep scrolling.” When he said Mom, I nodded again.
He began talking to my mother as the paramedics arrived on the scene. They went to Garrett first as he
was in more serious need. Then paramedics came for me. I kept going in and out of consciousness as they
drove me to the hospital. Each time I was lucid, I saw Charlie’s face. Then I saw her in bed with my
brother. The thought of them together made my chest pound and my heart rate go up on the monitor I was
attached to.
“Sir, try to relax. We’ll be at the hospital any moment.”
How could I relax? I’d beaten up my brother after he told me he’d slept with my fiancée and wanted
her for himself. Then we’d been attacked. Relaxing wasn’t in the realm of possibilities.
As we were both being rushed through the hospital corridors, I heard the doctors talking about getting
us into surgery immediately. I also heard my mom’s voice.
“Are they going to be okay?” she asked the doctor.
“Both of your sons are injured pretty badly. We won’t know until we get them into surgery. The nurse
has some forms for you to sign and we’ll let you know as soon as we know anything.”
Chapter Thirty-Three
CHARLIE
Opening my eyes, I realized I was in the hospital. I looked down at my arm and I had a long gash with
stitches. My parents walked in as I was glancing at the IV attached to my other arm.
“Sweetie, we got here as soon as we could. The police told us someone tried to break in? What
happened? You weren’t…he didn’t…?” My mother couldn’t finish her last question as she put her hand
over her mouth.
“No, I’m okay. Nothing happened to me. Well, I cut my arm while shoving a butcher knife through the
crack in the door in an attempt to stop him from coming in.”
“That’s my girl,” my dad said, bending down to kiss me on the forehead. “We’re so grateful you’re
okay. If anything had happened to you—”
“I’m okay, Dad,” I said, putting my hand on his. “At first I didn’t know what to do when I saw the
doorknob turning back and forth, but then I came to my senses.” My parents sat on either side of me
holding my hands as I told them I was pretty sure Eric had tried to break in. I also told them about seeing
him at the Mexican restaurant.
“Did you give his name to the police?” my dad asked.
“Yeah, they’re looking for him. I don’t know if they found him or not. But I’m pretty sure I did stab him
a couple of times. At least I think I did. He yelled out, so I’m assuming his blood is on the door and the
front porch.”
“Well, the police will gather all the evidence. He needs to be locked up,” my mother said.
“Yeah, somehow I think he didn’t go to anger management classes like he claimed.”
“They’ll find him and put him behind bars like he deserves,” my dad stated.
“Honey, we have something to tell you. Something we found out before we came to see you.” My
mom’s eyes were filled with tears.
“What is it? What happened?”
My parents looked at each other, which made me very nervous. “Please just come out with it.”
“When we came in, we saw Mitch’s parents. They were in the waiting room.”
“Did you talk to them? Is Mitch okay?”
“Mitch and Garrett were found in the park both beaten up. They don’t know what happened, only that
they’re both hurt badly enough to each be in surgery,” my dad said, stroking my hand with his thumb.
I lay there speechless, envisioning them pounding on each other because of me. Because of what I did.
Now I’d have to tell my parents and see the disappointment in their eyes. I wasn’t ready to tell them, but it
was going to come out one way or another.
“I…I have a feeling they were fighting.”
“Why would they be fighting?” my mother asked.
How could I tell them? They loved Mitch so much. He’d been part of our family for a long time, and
my dad especially viewed him like a son. This was going to kill my parents. Tears streamed down my
face and I began swallowing hard. Where would I find the words?
My parents waited patiently for me to say something. “You’re gonna hate what I’ve done. I’m a terrible
person.”
“What are you talking about, sweetie? You’re a wonderful young woman. There’s nothing you could
ever do that we’d hate,” my father retorted.
I sighed heavily, bracing myself before I started telling them. “Garrett has been looking after me since
he got back into town.”
My mom nodded naively. “We know. He called us when you’d fallen asleep to say you weren’t coming
over.”
“Yes, he’s thoughtful that way. Anyway, he stayed over and during the night I’d been dreaming about
Mitch. I woke up and thought he was Mitch and…”
My mom looked down. “Oh honey, you were with Garrett.”
“Yes. I cheated on Mitch with his brother, but I didn’t realize it was Garrett.”
“Do you have feelings for Garrett?” my dad asked.
“No, but he told me he’s in love with me. We talked earlier tonight and he said he wasn’t gonna give
up. That he wanted us to be together.”
“Are you thinking he told Mitch about the two of you?” The look on my dad’s face was so sad. My
parents had been together for thirty years and I doubted either of them had ever cheated on the other.
“Well, either Garrett told Mitch when they went to the park or they ran into some kind of trouble.
Garrett seemed pretty insistent when he left that we belonged together and Mitch should be with Heather.”
Both my parents nodded, but grief was written all over their faces. The doctor came in to check on me,
relieving me from continuing the conversation.
“Hi, I’m Dr. Goldstein,” he said, extending his hand to shake hands with my parents.
“We’re Charlie’s parents, Tom and Tamera,” my father said, shaking the doctor’s hand. “When will
Charlie be released?”
“We’re just going to keep her overnight. She lost a lot of blood from the wound on her arm. She should
be able to go home in the morning.”
“Oh good,” both my parents said in unison.
The doctor checked my chart and continued on his way.
“I’m really tired. If it’s okay, can we talk more tomorrow?
“Of course, honey. We’ll see you in the morning,” my mom said. They both kissed me on the forehead
and left.
***
Tossing and turning, I woke up several times expecting to find Eric hovering over me. All I could do
was hope the police would arrest him and he’d be prosecuted. But how long would he go to jail for
breaking and entering? Technically, he didn’t do anything to me. Well, he scared the shit out of me, but I
didn’t think that would carry a long prison term.
Dozing again, I began dreaming. Two men were on separate rocks in the middle of the ocean, both
calling out to me. As I rowed toward them in a boat, I couldn’t discern which one was Mitch and which
one was Garrett. Waves were crashing against the boat and I was having trouble going forward. Still, they
called to me, and I continued my struggle to move in their direction. I had to choose, but which one? All I
wanted was Mitch, but the sun was too bright and they looked virtually the same. Strangely, it began to
feel like the boat was being pulled in one direction and I no longer had control. Fighting the pull of the
boat, my heart was racing, knowing somehow I was headed to the wrong man, but I couldn’t stop it. In one
last thrust of the ocean, my boat was thrown against the rock and I ended up in Garrett’s arms.
“See, I told you we belong together,” he said.
“No!” I screamed as I sat up in bed.
“Charlie, it’s okay. It was just a dream,” Kate said, taking my hand.
“Oh, you poor thing. I can’t believe all you’ve been through and I haven’t been here,” Natalie said,
practically suffocating me with her hug. My two best friends were sitting there, waiting for me to wake
up. I was so glad to see their beautiful faces.
“You’re both here,” I cried, my body shaking. I couldn’t be strong for one more second. Gasping for
air, I let everything go. Natalie kept holding me while Kate held my hand.
“We’ll always be here for you, Charlie,” Kate choked out. Natalie kept hugging me. The three of us
stayed as we were for a long time.
Natalie lifted her head and said, “I’m so sorry you’re going through all of this. I wish I’d been here
sooner.”
“You’re here at just the right time, Nat,” I said, my voice cracking. “How did you two know I was
here?”
“Your mom called me and I called Nat. She and Mac got home late last night.”
I sighed heavily. “So you know about Mitch and Garrett?”
“Your mom briefly told me about that too. I’m hoping to find out more if Lillian will tell me.”
“Who knows? I’m sure she wasn’t happy he spent time with you. She knows how close we are.”
“Well, she can’t keep everyone away,” Natalie said.
“Actually, she prevented me from seeing Mitch when he stayed in here before because he couldn’t
remember me. She’s been using that to her advantage and manipulating him.”
“I’m gonna go see if I can find out anything. I doubt I’m on Lillian’s radar just yet,” Kate said.
“That’d be great since I have no idea how either of them are after surgery.”
“I wish you’d called or texted. We could have come home sooner,” Natalie said, her brow slightly
furrowed.
There was no way in the world I was going to intrude on Mac and Natalie’s whirlwind honeymoon.
She’d been alone for so long and Mac had swept her off her feet. She deserved to be happy and Mac had
moved heaven and earth to make her elated.
I shook my head. “You and Mac deserved to have your honeymoon without interruption. Tell me about
it so I can think about something other than my own problems.”
“It was so wonderful,” Natalie said beaming. Marriage agreed with her. “Cruising there on the yacht
took several days and we just lounged around, spending time together. I’m so blessed to have Mac.”
“He’s blessed to have you, Nat. What islands did you visit?”
“We wanted downtime, so we went to Maui and Kauai. They were both amazing. We took a ton of
pictures and plan on having a luau at the house to show everyone.”
“That’ll be fun,” I said, wishing this were really a distraction, but I couldn’t get my mind off Mitch.
Natalie continued talking, but my brain couldn’t register her words. I just smiled and nodded when it
seemed appropriate.
Kate came back visibly upset.
“Kate, what is it?” I asked, afraid to hear her answer. If Mitch had died, I didn’t know what I was
going to do.
“I spoke with the nurse. Mitch is in a coma. He’s in pretty bad shape…but they have managed to repair
the damage.”
“He’s in a coma?”
“Yes.”
“And Garrett?”
“He almost died, but he’s in ICU right now. They’re not sure if he’s gonna make it.”
“What?” I gasped. “It’s all my fault. They were fighting over me.” No, no, no. This wasn’t happening.
“They both have to make it.” I couldn’t believe this.
“There’s no way this is your fault,” Natalie said.
“Sweetie, you can’t blame yourself. Garrett and Mitch are grown men. There was nothing you could do
to stop them,” Kate said, taking my hand again.
“I don’t know what happened to them. They hadn’t been close for a while. When Garrett moved, they
didn’t speak again. Garrett’s never come home to visit. He would avoid Mitch’s calls.”
“I had no idea. Mitch really never said anything,” Kate said.
“We assumed it had something to do with Lillian. But, it turns out it had to do with me. Garrett
confessed he’s in love with me and he left because he couldn’t stand to see us together.”
“So, you think Garrett finally told Mitch about his feelings?” Natalie asked. “You think that caused the
fight?”
“Well, not entirely,” I said, looking at Kate with raised eyebrows. She slightly shook her head,
indicating she hadn’t told Nat about me cheating.
I looked into Nat’s big blue eyes. I couldn’t sugar coat what I’d done. “Nat, I got drunk, Garrett stayed
over, I thought he was Mitch and we….” I couldn’t finish my sentence as my lips trembled and tears filled
my eyes.
“Oh, Charlie.” Nat squeezed my hand. “It’s not like you knowingly had an affair. You were hurting
from Mitch not remembering you and drank too much. Garrett should have stopped you. He wasn’t drunk,
was he?”
“No, he wasn’t.”
Nat furrowed her brow. “And he let you have sex with him, knowing how much you had to drink?”
“Yes.”
“He just wanted his way and didn’t care what the consequences were. He put you in a terrible
position.”
“But I cheated…on Mitch.”
“Because Garrett put you in that position. Mitch never would’ve done that. He would’ve protected
you. Garrett didn’t protect you—he took advantage of you.”
Taking in Natalie’s words brought me great comfort. My shoulders relaxed and I said, “Thanks for
saying that. I hadn’t thought of Garrett’s role, but somehow I’m not sure Mitch will see it that way.”
“Mitch loves you more than anything. Don’t underestimate him. He’ll be angry, but I really believe
he’ll forgive you,” Kate said.
“I hope you’re right. Did they give you any further information about Mitch’s condition? When he’ll be
awake?”
“No, sweetie. All the nurse said was he was in a coma.”
The doctor on duty came in and checked my chart.
“How are you feeling today?” he asked.
“I feel fine,” I said, attempting a half smile when what I really wanted was to get out of this hospital
bed and find Mitch.
“Any headache or nausea?”
“No,” I said, shaking my head.
“Good. Then I’m going to release you. If you have any numbing or tingling in your arm or a headache,
please come back to the hospital.”
“I will. Thank you, Doctor.”
The doctor left and Kate handed me my clothes from the closet. I got dressed in the bathroom while she
and Nat waited for me in my room. I combed my hands through my hair and tried to make myself feel
presentable.
“Ready to go?” Nat asked when I emerged from the bathroom.
“Sure. I should call my parents and let them know you’re here and taking me home.”
“Actually, they already know. They’re at your place right now packing up some things for you.”
“Oh, that’s so great,” I said, putting my hand to my chest. “I didn’t wanna go back there right now.
Actually, I just wanna see Mitch.”
“Then let’s go see him,” Kate said.
Being with my two best friends was such a huge help. I needed their support more than words could
express. I’d be so lost without them.
Chapter Thirty-Four
MITCH
Everything was quiet except for a continual beeping, but I had no idea where it was coming from. I
was so relaxed I couldn’t open my eyes, instead just drifting in my mind. Am I sleeping? I guessed so. It
felt like sleep, but my senses seemed heightened and I was more aware. Maybe I wasn’t in a deep sleep,
but on the peripheral edges.
“I can’t believe he’s alone right now,” Charlie said. She picked up my hand. “Mitch, I’m here. I need
you to wake up, baby. Please come back to me.” Her voice trembled.
I knew what Charlie wanted from me, but I couldn’t comply. No part of my body would move no
matter how much I wanted it to. I was angry with her and I wanted to yell at her, but I also wanted to love
her. What the fuck is wrong with me? What if Garrett was telling the truth…I couldn’t believe it. There
was no way. He had to have been lying, but why? Why did we end up in a fistfight? Nothing in my world
made sense since falling off the ladder. Nothing.
“He looks pretty banged up,” Kate said. “We need to find out from the doctor how bad it is.”
How bad what is? What the hell is Kate talking about? I wish I could open my fucking eyes right
now. Damn it.
“What the hell are you doing here?” my mom asked.
“I’m visiting my fiancée, Lillian. He needs me and I’m going to be here for him.”
“Not if I have anything to say about it.” Her seething words made the temperature in the room rise.
“That’s enough, Lillian,” said my dad.
“Edward, please.”
“No, Lillian. I’ve stood by long enough. You will not stop Charlie from seeing Mitch. He loves her and
asked her to marry him. That’s good enough for me, and it’s going to be good enough for you.”
“Edward, that girl there has destroyed our family.”
“No, Lillian, you did that a long time ago. And I’ve allowed it. But no more. Either adhere to my
wishes or get the hell out, and I don’t just mean this hospital room. We have two sons fighting for their
lives. Enough with your vendettas.”
I wanted to sit up and cheer my dad on. I’d never heard him talk that way to my mom. But what did he
mean two sons fighting for their lives? Shit. Did I hurt Garrett that badly? If that’s the case, maybe I didn’t
want to wake up. This dream state had just become my worst nightmare. What if Garret died? How would
I live with myself? How could any of this have happened? I had so many questions but couldn’t open my
mouth to get any answers.
“Thank you for defending me,” Charlie said to my dad. “Where do you think she went?”
“I don’t know and I don’t care. When she brought Heather back into Mitch’s life I should have stopped
things then. I’m sorry I didn’t.”
“It’s okay. I get how controlling she is. Has the doctor given you any idea about Mitch’s prognosis?”
“They believe he’s going to pull through. The surgery was a success. He had some internal injuries, but
they were able to…to repair them.” My dad paused for a long moment. “But they have no idea when or if
he’ll come out of his coma.” I’d never heard my dad choked up before. He was always stoic,
disconnected from us, and I didn’t know why. Maybe that’d change now.
“We’re very sorry you’re going through all of this, Mr. Hawkins,” Kate said. “What did the doctor say
about Garrett’s condition?”
“He’s in critical condition. The next twenty-four hours are…they hope to know more then.”
“Where are my manners? Natalie, this is Mitch’s dad.”
“Edward,” he said to Natalie. “Kate, I want you to call me Edward too.”
“It’s so good to meet you,” Natalie said. “Your son is like a big brother to me. He’s helped me through
a lot in the last few years.”
“Mitch has always had a huge heart. One of the best things about him. I’m going to go check in with the
nurses’ station and make sure Lillian isn’t tearing the hospital apart. Please visit with Mitch as long as
you like.”
No one said anything for a moment while I assume my dad was walking out the door.
“I can’t believe Edward stood up to Lillian. I think this is the most I’ve ever heard him talk,” Charlie
said.
“Well, at least you know you can visit Mitch without any problems,” said Natalie.
“I bet Lillian will still give you a hard time. So you probably want to watch your back,” said Kate.
“Yeah, I won’t be letting my guard down, that’s for sure. But I can’t worry about her. All I want right
now is for Mitch to open his eyes. I want us to get married next month like we discussed. I want our life
back.”
“It’ll happen,” Natalie said. “You just have to believe.”
Natalie was right. I was going to believe at some point when my body was ready I’d wake up.
The doctor came in and began talking with Charlie. “Do you have any idea why Mitch would be taking
steroids? Has he taken them in the past?”
“What? No, he doesn’t take steroids.”
“His blood tested positive for three different steroids. The medication prescribed for him by Dr.
Grayson wasn’t in his system.”
“How could that have happened? I know he was taking his meds.”
“I have no idea. The name of the medication prescribed and the names of the steroids are nothing alike.
I can’t imagine any pharmacist making this kind of mistake, but I’m going to get to the bottom of this.”
What? I wasn’t taking the right meds? I almost wished I couldn’t hear anything because the bad news
just kept coming and there was nothing I could do to stop it.
Chapter Thirty-Five
CHARLIE
How was it possible Mitch was taking the wrong drugs? The news was unbelievable. Could the drugs
have triggered his fight with Garrett? I knew steroids made people more aggressive. Maybe Garrett giving
Mitch the news about what had happened between us just pushed him over the edge. All of this was
beyond a nightmare.
Leaving Mitch at the hospital was heartbreaking. Everything was out of my hands, especially when he
would come out of his coma. I knew there was the possibility he may not come out of it, but I wasn’t going
to think about that now. I had to think positive and hope for the best or I wasn’t going to survive this.
Kate and Nat dropped me off at my parents’ house. Relief swept over me just knowing I didn’t have to
stay at my place. Eric had scared me more than I wanted to admit, but I was so grateful he didn’t get to
me. I couldn’t imagine the trauma of being attacked by him on top of everything else. Thankfully Dad had
organized to have the front door fixed and the place cleaned up. I couldn’t bear to go back there to see the
destruction.
The unfortunate thing was he knew where my parents lived from when we dated and I had no clue if
he’d look for me here. My dad had his gun locked and loaded in case Eric showed up. But I was safer
here than anywhere else I could think of, except for Mitch’s arms. My mind wondered at the thought of
being in his muscular arms, resting my head on his sculpted chest. I loved him so much and hated what
was happening to us.
My cell phone went off and all I could think was that Mitch had woken up. “Hello,” I said with
urgency.
“May I speak with Charlie Andrews?” a man asked.
“This is she,” I replied.
“Miss Andrews, this is Detective Morrison. I was hoping you could come down to the station. We’ve
arrested Eric Machado and we need a statement from you.”
“I’ll be there as soon as I can,” I said, a nervous energy surging through me.
Our call ended and I went to the kitchen to find my parents, who were making lunch.
“Mom, Dad, I just got a call from a Detective Morrison and they’ve arrested Eric. I need to go to the
station and give a statement.”
“Okay, let’s go,” my dad said. Knowing my parents would be there with me made this a little easier to
take. I was so blessed to have such supportive, loving parents. They’d always been my rock.
My dad drove us to the station. When we arrived, an officer directed us to a room where we waited
for Detective Morrison. Within five minutes, he arrived with a recorder in hand. My dad stood to shake
his hand and introduce himself.
“Detective Morrison, I’m Tom Andrews, Charlie’s father. This is my wife, Tamera, and this is
Charlie.”
“Pleased to meet all of you,” the detective said. “I know you told the officers last night what happened,
but since we’ve arrested Mr. Machado, I’d like to ask you a few questions.”
“Of course,” I said, grateful they had him in custody.
The questions from the detective were similar to those from last night, but I did my best to try to
remember anything new that I could.
“So, you’re certain it was Eric Machado’s voice?”
“Yes, I even called him Eric when he was on the other side of the bathroom door and when he realized
the police were coming, he fled.”
“Okay. A hearing will be set for him and he may get out on bail. Breaking and entering doesn’t carry a
very stiff sentence, a year at the most, since he didn’t rob you. Any idea why he was breaking in?”
“When we dated, seven years ago, I had always felt fearful around him. He was rough and controlling
with me then. I don’t know what he wants with me now,” I said, the vile thought leaving a bad taste in my
mouth.
“If the district attorney can show intent to cause harm, then he may do some real time. A few years.”
“When will the DA contact me?”
“I’m not sure, but he or one of his assistants will be in touch.”
We said our goodbyes to the detective and promised to let him know if anything else came to me. I
wasn’t looking forward to facing Eric in court and had no idea if the DA could prove intent of harm. Eric
had a way of getting out of things, but maybe with him finding me at the restaurant, intent could be
established.
Driving home with my parents, it dawned on me I had no idea what day it was. I hadn’t checked in
with work. I just felt out of sorts and I knew this feeling wasn’t going to go away for a long time.
With barely enough energy to move from the car to inside the house, I walked at a snail’s pace. I went
to lie down in my room for a while, just to recover from going to the police station. The stress of
everything had taken its toll. At least I had the security of being with my parents. Wrapping up in my
comforter calmed my spirit and the coziness helped me to drift to sleep. I wished I didn’t have to wake up
until everything was back to normal, but I didn’t have luck like that.
***
Tossing and turning all night, I’d awoken several times with thoughts of Mitch. At one point, I could
have sworn he was there with me, holding me, but it was just a dream. That’s all I seemed to have now…
dreams. Morning arrived faster than what I was ready for, and my phone began ringing the moment I
opened my eyes. It was Detective Morrison.
“Miss Andrews, this is Detective Morrison. We just got back the DNA results of the blood found at
your apartment, and Eric Machado’s blood isn’t a match. He’s not the guy who was trying to break in.
Plus, he doesn’t have any stab wounds on his body.”
“What? Are…are you positive?” I couldn’t believe it.
“Yes, there’s no way it was him. Whoever it is was not in our data system. He has no prior record.”
I didn’t know what to say. I had been so certain it was him and now I had some other deranged guy to
worry about. Who would be trying to break into my place? The voice seemed familiar, so I really thought
it was Eric.
“What happens now?” I asked.
“Now we have to try to find the guy based on the evidence we have.”
“But if he’s not in the system, how are you going to do that?”
“One of the things that makes this job so difficult. We’ll do our best to find him, that’s all I can tell
you.”
“I understand. Thank you for the call, Detective.”
“I’ll be in touch as soon as we have anything to go on.”
We said our goodbyes and that was it. I sat there, unable to move for what seemed like an eternity. I
believed in my heart the man trying to break in knew me and I’d most definitely heard his voice before. I
pulled my knees up to my chest and wrapped my arms around them. This was too much. How was I going
to be able to live my life freely not knowing who my would-be attacker was? I had to place his voice.
That’s all I had to go on.
The rumbling of my stomach beckoned me to the kitchen. My parents sat at the kitchen table drinking
coffee, both with empty plates in front of them.
“Honey, I have a plate of food for you staying warm in the oven,” my mom said.
One of the many perks of being home—my mom taking care of me. “Thanks, Mom,” I said as I grabbed
the oven mitt. I sat at the table, placing the plate in front of me.
“Has something else happened?” my dad asked. “You look white as a ghost.”
I looked at my dad, then at my mom. I felt sick to my stomach just thinking about what I was about to
tell them. “You’re not gonna believe this, but Eric wasn’t the one trying to break into my apartment.”
“What are you talking about?” my mom asked.
“Detective Morrison called a little while ago and the blood found at my apartment was not Eric’s
blood.”
“Then whose blood was it?” my dad asked.
“They have no idea. I was so sure it was Eric, but maybe it was my mind playing tricks on me since I
saw him earlier in the week. I really thought I recognized the voice.”
My dad reached out and put his hand on mine. “You’re going to be safe here, sweetheart. I’ll make sure
of it.”
If there was one thing I knew I could count on, it was my dad’s promise.
Chapter Thirty-Six
MITCH
February
Just lying here, I could feel myself becoming weaker and I hated that I couldn’t just wake up. I wished
the nurses would move me more. I’d always been into fitness and I knew each passing moment with me
lying in this bed was another step further away from being in peak shape.
My mother and Heather had been visiting me every day. Didn’t they know I didn’t want to see them or
hear them? Heather had a lot of nerve trying to take advantage of me when I couldn’t remember what had
happened between us. But the real blow was overhearing her and my mom talk about how the baby
actually wasn’t mine. She’d let me believe it was our child.
Oh shit. Here they are again. I really need to wake up so I can get the hell away from both of them.
“He looks like he has more color in his cheeks,” my mom said.
“Yes, he does,” Heather replied somberly.
“Are you okay?” my mother asked.
“I don’t think I can do this anymore.”
“Do what?”
“Come here. Visit Mitch. Pretend to be his girlfriend.”
“What do you mean? You are his girlfriend.”
“No, I’m not. He loves Charlie. They’re engaged and I horned in while he wasn’t himself. If I really
cared about him, I’d let him go.”
Finally, she was coming to her senses.
“You’re not horning in. You’re fighting for what you want, Heather. Mitch was happy to have you back
in his life. You need to focus on that.”
“Lillian, I appreciate all you have done for me, but I need to go. I hope Mitch wakes up soon and has a
full recovery, but I can’t stick around any longer. It’s only going to cause me and him both a lot of pain.”
“Heather, you’re making a mistake. When he wakes up, we can both convince him that he belongs with
you.”
“That’s just it, Lillian. I don’t want to have to convince anyone to be with me. I want them to love me
for me, not for whatever trick I’m playing on them. Mitch is a wonderful man and I’ll always love him,
but I have to do what is right in my heart. I have to move on because he clearly has and when he wakes up,
he’s going to be with Charlie, not me.”
“He may not remember her, Heather. The doctors don’t know what’ll happen.”
“But what if we become a couple again and he remembers down the road? I can’t go through the pain
of losing him again. It was brutal the first time. It took me years to get over it.”
“Heather, I don’t know what else to say. If that’s how you feel, then I’ll do my best to understand.”
“Thank you, Lillian…for everything.”
My mom didn’t say anything else. I wanted to sit up and applaud Heather for her wise decision
because there was no way in hell I was getting back together with her. Ever. But, I couldn’t move a muscle
and I couldn’t yell at my mom to shut the hell up. Although I’d love to give her a piece of my mind for
bringing Heather back into my life and pushing Charlie out when I couldn’t remember.
Charlie. My beautiful girl. She’d been coming to visit me too. I was so pissed that she’d been alone
and someone had broken in. I really wanted to beat the shit out of that guy. I was so grateful she’d thought
quickly and protected herself. If anything had happened to her…I don’t know what I’d do. Then I thought
about Garrett and the terrible fight we had. I had no idea how he was doing. For all I knew I could’ve
killed him. I wish someone would talk about him. Why did he have to tell me about him and Charlie? I
was furious with both of them for betraying me, but Garrett kept saying it wasn’t her fault. He let her
believe she was having sex with me. He knew while they were…I just couldn’t stand the thought of them
being together. Another thing I wasn’t sure I could live with for the rest of my life. But time seemed to be
standing still. I had no idea if it’d been a day or a week or longer.
“Your brother’s going to pull through. It was touch and go for a while, but he’s going to be okay. He
told me to tell you how sorry he is, but he didn’t say for what.”
My mom stopped talking. Maybe she was choked up? I’d never seen her vulnerable before; she always
put on a front. It took me being incapacitated for her to be real.
She took my hand and held it tight. “I’m so grateful you’re both alive, Mitch. Surviving that attack. The
police are looking for the men who attacked you and Garrett, but they don’t have any leads. That’s our
justice system for you.”
My mom stopped talking again. “We all want you to wake up. Do you hear me? You need to wake up,”
she said, her voice wavering. My mom was crying. I’d never heard or seen her cry before. I was kind of
glad I couldn’t wake up right now. I didn’t want to seem cruel by not comforting her. I just wanted her to
have a clue. All of her attempts to control us had blown up in her face and her family was paying the
price.
“Hi Mrs. Hawkins,” I heard Kate say. “How’s Mitch today?”
“He’s the same, Kate. Come in. I was just about to leave.”
“Please don’t rush off on my account. I can come back later.”
“No, I have some things to take care of, so I need to get going. I’m sure Mitch will be happy you’re
here.”
“I’ve been trying to come visit him as often as I can. I sure do miss him.”
“Me too. I just want him to wake up.”
“He will, Lillian. You just have to have faith.”
“I’m afraid faith has been a difficult thing for me.”
“I think it’s difficult for everyone at some point in their life.”
“Well, you certainly have been through enough to test your faith. I’m glad things are going well for you
now, Kate.”
“Thank you. I’m truly blessed in my life. I’m praying for Mitch, you know.”
“I think we all could use some prayers.”
“I’ll pray for you too, Lillian,” Kate said. I could tell she was being sincere.
“Thank you, Kate. I better go.”
I didn’t hear my mom talking anymore, but I could hear the clacking of her heels on the floor.
“Mitch, it’s February 18th and you need to wake up. You and Charlie are supposed to get married. I
know how you hate disappointing her,” she said, squeezing my hand.
It’s February? I’ve been out that long? She was right. I wanted to make Charlie happy at all costs. She
was the love of my life, and I’d do anything in my power to keep her safe and make her dreams come true.
But this was way beyond my capabilities. I kept willing myself to open my eyes, but it just wasn’t
happening.
“Don’t worry, she’ll marry you whether it’s today or next month. She misses you so much.”
I missed my beautiful girl too. Open your eyes, damn it.
Kate told me about everything going on in her life. She was thrilled to be married to Neil. He was a
good man and I knew David would approve of her choice.
Chapter Thirty-Seven
CHARLIE
March
A few weeks had gone by without any change in Mitch’s condition. It was weeks past our wedding
date with no end in sight of being without my Mitch. I missed him so much. Visiting him in the hospital
and seeing him lifeless in that bed was torturous.
Edward had held true to his word and I was able to visit Mitch, hold his hand, talk to him. At least that
was something, and all I could do was pray that when he woke up, he’d remember me and our lives
together. I did everything in my power to sound positive when I visited him, but it was so hard. I had no
idea if he could hear me and if he could, what he might be thinking. The guilt of what I’d done had been
eating me up inside. I just hoped our love was strong enough to survive whatever Garrett had told him. It
had to be.
Surprising even the medical staff, Garrett had been moved from the ICU into a normal ward within
three days of the attack. The doctors suggested Mitch’s brain required more rest given the short time
between the two head injuries. Within three weeks, doctors declared Garrett fit to travel, even on a plane,
so he decided to return to New York. He had a few friends there who would look after him as he
recovered. I had Kate deliver a message to him, telling him that I wished him well, but I couldn’t offer
him anything more than friendship. I wasn’t sure if I was being cowardly or not, but I just didn’t want to
deal with him. It was too much to take on any more of his feelings. He read my note and nodded. He didn’t
say anything to Kate. I think he knew he’d made everything worse and there was nothing left to say.
The police had no leads on who had attempted to attack me, so I was on the lookout constantly and
wondering every time I saw a man if he was the one. I examined every voice, but couldn’t be sure of
anything with all the stress I was under. Every man’s voice I heard caused me to imagine he was the one.
The one who’d broken into my apartment to do God knows what. My dad didn’t let me go anywhere
alone, becoming my personal guard.
Nighttime was the worst, as I woke up with nightmares of being attacked by this man. Getting away
from him seemed impossible and I was living in fear that he’d come to my parents’ home to finish what
he’d started. Even though he hadn’t physically violated me, he had emotionally on some level because of
his familiarity. Becoming a prisoner of my own fears, I went nowhere alone.
The doctor I’d spoken with at the hospital about the drugs Mitch was taking had found out Eric had
filled the prescription for Mitch, so the ADA had filed charges against him for drug tampering. A trial
hadn’t been set, but I was doing everything in my power to help build the case against Eric. I’d done
several interviews with the ADA, detailing at great length the relationship I had with Eric years ago. I
hated reliving those bad memories and knew I was going to have to testify about them at his trial, but I
was the motive for Eric’s crime and I’d do anything to make him pay for attempting to hurt Mitch.
It’d be interesting to see if Lillian had anything to do with it. I would assume she’d been the one who
filled the prescription. I must be losing my mind, because I knew there was no way Lillian would do
anything to harm Mitch. She’d been a fierce lioness since the moment I met her.
Time had been a whirlwind and I couldn’t seem to get my energy back, but I’d returned to work.
Staring out the window of my office, I daydreamed about marrying Mitch on February 22nd, a date that
had slipped away from me weeks ago, like sand through my fingers. A knock at the door brought me out of
my reverie.
I looked up and saw my boss, Trace, standing in my open doorway.
“I know it’s been crazy here the last couple of weeks, but I wanted to check in with you, see how
you’re doing.”
“I’m hanging in there,” I said, nodding.
“Maybe you need to try a little harder to convince me. I’m concerned about you. We all are.”
“Thanks, Trace. I have to admit, this is the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through. The not knowing when
Mitch is going to wake up is killing me.”
“I can’t imagine. I’d be lost if anything happened to Angelina. She’s my rock.”
I looked down, thinking about how Mitch was my rock, and I missed him desperately. “I know what
you mean.”
Trace came in and shut the door behind him, making his way to my desk. He sat in the chair in front of
me. “You don’t have to put on a brave front for me or Angelina. We’re both here for you. If there’s
anything you need, just say the word.”
“Thank you. That means so much. I’ve been staying with my parents, and they’ve been a huge support.
Plus, my two closest friends have been by my side.”
Trace smiled. He was such a handsome man, but more than that, he had a big heart. Angelina was as
lucky as I was in the man department. I hoped she knew what an amazing man she was engaged to. “So,
how are your wedding plans coming along?”
“Well, I say yes to everything my bride wants and so we haven’t had a single problem so far.”
I laughed out loud. “Smart man.”
“Yeah, I learned when it comes to weddings, it’s all about the bride. My two sisters taught me that.”
“They’re both married?”
“Yeah, and their husbands nodded a lot and gave them their way. So, I’m following their lead. Anyway,
I’ve got a meeting. I’m glad you’re doing okay,” he said, getting up to take his leave.
“Me too.”
Working helped to keep me occupied, but my mind still wandered and I had to put all my effort into
concentrating. I hadn’t been feeling like myself lately and had been sleeping more than usual. My mom
thought it was all the stress, but if I didn’t get back to normal soon, I was going to visit my doctor.
Chapter Thirty-Eight
MITCH
Charlie’s mouth grazed my neck as her hand made its way toward my cock. Wrapping her fingers
around me, she began stroking and every nerve ending was lit on fire. I couldn’t wait to be inside of
her, feeling her grip my cock and her legs wrap around me.
Who is that and why did they have to come here now? I wondered as I heard someone approaching.
Things were just getting good…in my mind.
“Hi, Mitch,” Heather said.
I thought I was done with her and she’d decided to bow out gracefully. I was so frustrated I couldn’t
say this to her out loud.
“I wanted to come by and talk to you.”
Obviously. Just say what you have to say and go. Please. Shit. I sounded like a cranky asshole in my
own mind.
“First, I’m so sorry for manipulating you like I did. I just got caught up in the moment of having you
back. I didn’t think about the consequences and I know I only brought more pain and confusion.”
Heather picked up my hand and held it tight. “I guess this is the only way I can hold your hand now.
You have to be unconscious. I really made a bigger mess of things. If only I’d listened to you when we
were in high school. Trusted you. Things would be different. Now I have to get over you all over again.”
Her heartfelt words made me feel sorry for her. She’d been manipulated by my mother back then and
again now. My mom was a master at it.
“I remember the first time you asked me out. In the hall, by our lockers. When you spoke to me,
everything in the world stopped and all I could see or hear was you. I was so excited. I think I walked on
air the rest of the day. You made me feel special and cherished during our entire relationship, Mitch. I’ll
always love you for that,” she said, her voice cracking.
Please don’t cry. I hate it when girls cry. I wanted to reach out and comfort Heather even though I was
angry with her. If my mother hadn’t have interfered in our lives, we could’ve had a shot at making things
work. But I had moved on and Charlie was the woman I loved. Nothing was going to change that.
Nothing.
“Well, I should go. You won’t be seeing me again. I’ve decided to move to Texas. I have an aunt who
lives there and all my cousins. Being with you again made me realize just how lonely I’ve become here. I
wanna be with family and leave the past in the past. I’ll always love you, Mitch.”
With that, she kissed me on the lips and left.
I was proud of Heather for having the courage to face me and say goodbye. She’d grown up and
decided to be a stand-up person instead of a manipulator like my mother.
Chapter Thirty-Nine
CHARLIE
Waiting for Eric to go on trial had been tedious to say the least. It was finally scheduled, but not for a
few months. I was fortunate I hadn’t run into him, but I had hid away in my parents’ home, so it was
unlikely I’d run into anyone. Fear was still controlling my life and sleep eluded me. But today I was going
to the doctor to get some anxiety medication. I felt ready to jump out of my skin all the time and I knew I
needed some help. Maybe I’d be able to sleep again with the meds.
The nurse called my name and I was escorted into the back. She took all my vitals and weighed me
before showing me to the exam room.
“The doctor will be right with you.”
“Thank you,” I said, grateful that relief would soon be on the way.
A knock came at the door, followed by it being opened. “Miss Andrews, I’m Dr. Flores,” he said,
extending his hand to mine. He had a kind face and seeing him relaxed me somehow.
“Good to meet you, Dr. Flores,” I said as I shook his hand.
“So, I see you’ve come in for anxiety. What specifically seems to be the problem?”
I went on to explain to the doctor my symptoms of being tired, loss of sleep, and general fear due to the
break in. He was very sympathetic.
“Before I give you a prescription, when was your last menstrual cycle?”
Sitting there for a long moment, I couldn’t remember my last period. Strange. It was nearly April, and I
hadn’t thought about my period at all. The stress had been too much with Mitch being hurt and laid up in
the hospital. I couldn’t believe I’d forgotten about having a period.
“Well, I’m not regular, but honestly, I have no idea. I’ve been under so much stress—I just don’t
know,” I said, squinting my eyes.
“Well, a simple urine test will tell us if you’re pregnant.”
“Pregnant? I doubt I’m pregnant.”
“Are you not sexually active?”
“I am. I just always use protection.” The words escaped my mouth, but the thought of Garrett and I
captured my brain. Shit. We didn’t use protection.
Before I could say anything else, the same nurse was showing me to the bathroom and pointing to the
cups on the counter for me to pee into. After closing the door and locking it, I stood there, staring at the
cups. This couldn’t be happening. It. Just. Couldn’t.
A few moments later, I was handing the cup to the nurse. “How long will it take for the results?”
“Oh, just a few minutes. I’ll let you know as soon as I know,” she said, returning me to the exam room.
“Dr. Flores will be with you shortly.”
As I sat in the chair, my mind was spinning, replaying that night with Garrett. I knew I hadn’t slipped a
condom on him before I wrapped my body around his. All I could do was hope I was late because of all
the stress I’d been under. Please, God. Let it be that. But the fact I couldn’t remember my last period had
my heart racing. How had this escaped me? Months had gone by.
Dr. Flores returned. “Miss Andrews, I can’t prescribe anxiety medication for you today because your
test came back positive. You’re pregnant.”
***
Before stepping out into the lobby, I texted Kate that I needed to see her right away. She texted back to
come over anytime.
My dad was waiting for me, reading his Kindle. He looked up as I approached.
“Everything okay, sweetheart?”
“Yes. Everything’s fine. The doctor gave me some instructions on relaxing. He wants to wait to
prescribe any meds.”
“Really?” my dad asked. “Usually they are more than happy to give out drugs.”
“Well, I think Dr. Flores has a more holistic approach. Anyway, Kate texted me, inviting me over for a
visit.”
“Well, let’s go then. I’ll drop you off and I can pick you up when you’re ready.”
“Thanks, Dad.”
I barely said two words to my dad on the drive to Kate’s. He was singing along with the radio and
didn’t seem to notice. He waited in the car while I knocked on her door. When she opened it, he waved at
her, but didn’t drive off until I was safely inside. He’d always been and always would be protective.
I didn’t waste any time delivering the jaw-dropping news to Kate. Especially the part where Garrett
was most likely the father.
“Oh Charlie,” she said, grabbing me and hugging me. “Maybe you’re wrong. Maybe the baby is
Mitch’s.”
I could always count on Kate to be positive. I knew she wanted the best for me and would do whatever
it took to help me.
“Maybe. But somehow I doubt it. I don’t remember using protection with Garrett. Mitch and I had been
together the morning of his accident, but we used a condom. We always do because I’m allergic to birth
control pills.”
“Oh, yeah, I forgot about that. But it’s still possible for the baby to be Mitch’s.”
“I was with Garrett about three days after being with Mitch. So, I guess it’s possible, but with how my
life has been going, highly unlikely.”
“Well, condoms aren’t a hundred percent,” she said, her face riddled with sorrow for me.
“You’re right,” I whispered. Even talking had become too much for me.
Kate put her arm around me and began guiding me to the sectional in the living room. “You sit and I’m
gonna make us some tea. Are you hungry?”
“No. But the tea would be good.”
“I’ll be back in a minute. You just try to relax.”
Kate went into the kitchen and I closed my eyes.
My mind drifted and soon I was seeing myself pregnant with a dark-haired man holding me, telling
me how much he loved me and our baby. Pulling back to see his face, it was Garrett, looking at me
adoringly.
My eyes shot open suddenly, a gasp escaping from my mouth. It was just a dream.
Kate returned with our tea and I literally cried on her shoulder as she tried to reassure me everything
was going to be okay.
“I can’t believe all of this is happening, Kate. It’s just too much. Mitch is never gonna forgive me and I
can’t blame him.”
“I know you’re overwhelmed. Somehow, everything’s gonna be okay, I promise. I really believe Mitch
will understand in time.”
“Would you? If Neil slept with your sister, if you had one? Could you forgive him if she were pregnant
with his child?”
Kate opened her mouth, but then closed it. She breathed in deeply, prolonging her answer. “I honestly
don’t know. I’d like to believe I’d forgive him, but I’m not a hundred percent sure. What about you? Could
you forgive Mitch?”
“I wanna say yes, of course. But I really don’t know either.”
In the midst of our conversation, Neil came home. He kissed Kate on the top of her head.
“Hi, baby. Hi, Charlie. Sorry to interrupt.”
“You’re not interrupting,” I said.
“Sounds like you two are having an important conversation. Has something happened to Mitch?”
“No,” Kate said. “Mitch is the same.”
Neil nodded.
“I didn’t cook anything for dinner, so maybe we could get takeout.”
“Sure, what do you feel like having?”
Kate looked at Charlie. “I think we need some Italian comfort food.”
“I’ll order three or four dishes and we can all share?”
Kate and I nodded. I was too overwhelmed to choose something for dinner, so Neil’s suggestion was
perfect. He had a way of sizing things up and knowing just what to do. Something he and Mitch had in
common.
Neil was back with bags of food in no time. He had enough for a party, even though it was just the
three of us. We gathered around the kitchen island and Kate began helping Neil unpack the bags.
“Did you order enough food?” Kate asked, laughing.
“Well, I got five different dishes, plus salad, and dessert. I think dessert is in order tonight. I’ll pour
some wine for us.”
“None for me, thanks,” I said, wishing I could have some.
Neil raised his eyebrows. “You can stay in the guest room, so you don’t have to worry about getting
home.”
“That’s not the reason,” Kate murmured.
“Let’s dish up the food and talk while eating.” Neil and Kate agreed with that plan. Once we sat at the
table, I began telling Neil what was going on.
He didn’t say much at first—astonished, I assumed.
“Wow, Charlie. I’m sure you’re beside yourself.”
“Yeah, that’s an understatement. So, counselor, what’s your advice?”
“I don’t have any. I wish I could tell you something to do to make everything okay again, but the truth is
you’re gonna have to wait until Mitch comes out of his coma and see his reaction. I can’t predict how he’s
gonna feel about this news.”
“I know,” I said glumly. I put my hand to my forehead. “This is a giant CF.”
“I’ve known Mitch for a long time and, as you know, he has a huge heart,” Kate said. “When we spoke
about you and Heather, he figured Heather had cheated on him and that was why they broke up. But as I
said to him and have said to you, you’re each other’s soul mate. Will he look past the accidental sex?
Probably, but it may take time. I think the same applies to the baby, Charlie. I think he loves you too much
and wouldn’t be able to turn his back on you or the baby. It may take time to get your relationship back on
track, but I feel it should work out in the end. It may take patience.” Kate reached her hand across the
table to squeeze mine. There was my best friend, doing all she could to make me feel better. I could
always count on her.
“Did the doctor determine your date of conception? I think they’re pretty accurate,” Neil asked.
“I didn’t think to ask when I was in his office, but I Googled pregnancy conception dates on my phone
when my dad was driving me over. The conception date is an estimate based on the first day of my last
period. I seriously have no clue when I had my last period, let alone the date it started. I just…can’t
remember. Too much has happened in our lives.”
“But you think the baby belongs to Garrett? Why?”
“Because we didn’t use protection and I used protection with Mitch. But, Kate pointed out condoms
aren’t one hundred percent, so maybe the baby is Mitch’s. God, let it be Mitch’s.”
Neil had such compassion in his eyes. “Charlie, we’re here for you and we’ll do anything to help you
and Mitch through this when he comes out of his coma. Try your best to relax.”
I knew Neil was giving me good advice and I had to calm down. Feeling stressed over this wasn’t
good for the baby or me.
Chapter Forty
MITCH
It was hard to tell when I was sleeping and when I was awake unless someone was in the room with
me. Of course, the nightmares of Garrett and I fighting told me I was sleeping and I couldn’t wrap my
mind around the fact we had come to blows. Things got out of hand so quickly and at one point, I thought I
was going to kill him or he was going to kill me. Some days I wished he had. Living in this state of limbo,
my new existence, was horrible. I was a shell with an active mind, hearing everything going on around
me, but incapable of participating in any way. I knew there was no guarantee I’d ever come out of this,
which made me wish for death on a regular basis.
Someone entered my room and I could sense their presence, smell their cologne, but they didn’t speak.
The scent clued me into the fact it was a man. A woman wouldn’t wear a woodsy cologne like that. Who
was he and why wasn’t he talking? An uneasy sensation spread over me while I waited for something to
happen. I hated being vulnerable like this, unable to defend myself if I had to.
He came closer to me and hovered over me. What the hell do you want? My heart rate had increased
significantly, my instincts telling me something was very wrong. Then he whispered, “After I make her
mine, I’m coming back for you.”
What…the…fuck? Oh my God, he was talking about Charlie. I tried so hard to open my eyes, reach out
and grab this guy, but it was useless. Being a prisoner in my own body meant I couldn’t protect myself, let
alone Charlie.
Then he pulled away and I heard his faint footsteps as he left my room. What’s going on? Charlie had
told me about the break-in. I’d bet my life this was the guy who broke into our place. Since he whispered
it was difficult to get a read on his voice, but I knew I’d remember the scent of his cologne. It was very
distinctive.
If I could come out of my coma just from sheer will, I would. I’d chase the guy down and stop him
from breathing the same air as Charlie. But, there was nothing I could do except wait. Wait for this
nightmare to end and get my life back. Please, God, give me my life back.
Chapter Forty-One
CHARLIE
End of March
Two weeks had gone by before I got up the nerve to actually tell Mitch I was pregnant. I had no
intentions of telling Garrett. I couldn’t deal with him and was grateful he was gone. I’d gone to visit Mitch
every day, but as I sat there holding his hand, the words got caught in my throat and I couldn’t turn them
loose. Today I was determined to tell him even though I had no idea if he could hear me or not. Kate and
Natalie had assured me it’d be good to get it off my chest. They had both been so supportive and believed
no matter what happened, Mitch and I would work out. Holding onto their positive thoughts was all I
could do right now.
Squirting lotion into my hands, I picked up Mitch’s right hand and began lathering him with the thick
mixture. His hands were so dry and I made sure to work the lotion in until they became soft again.
“I miss you so much, baby. I just want you to open your eyes. Will you do that for me?”
I said this to him every day as if he’d answer my request, but nothing happened.
“Work’s been crazy. We have a new product coming out, so everyone has been putting in long hours.” I
wanted to hit myself in the head. Work? Who cares? Having a one-way conversation was so difficult. I
was used to Mitch’s quick wit that always made me laugh.
Looking at him lying there with his dark hair and strong jaw, he was so handsome. I hated that what I
was about to say had the potential of breaking his heart—if he could hear me. I’d read about coma
patients and many of them were completely aware of what was going on around them. I imagined this was
the case with Mitch.
“Mitch, I have something to tell you. Something that is very difficult for me to say. Something I wish I
wasn’t gonna say.”
I paused to gather my courage. I really needed a drink before getting this out, but that wasn’t going to
happen.
“I’m just gonna come out with it. I’m pregnant.”
I had fantasized about saying that to Mitch, but not under these circumstances. In my mind there’d be
celebrating, tears, laughter, cigars. But not in this scenario. At least I had finally told him.
“I can only assume that you and Garrett were fighting over what happened between him and me. It
breaks my heart that I did what I did, but I can’t take it back and there’s a possibility this baby is his. I’m
so sorry, Mitch. I hate this more than anything. All we wanted to do was move up our wedding date and
get married at my parents’ house. Everything’s so messed up. I just hope when you wake up you can
forgive me, Mitch. I love you so much. I never meant for any of this to happen to us.”

Chapter Forty-Two
MITCH
Charlie’s voice trembled as she spoke to me. I could hear her pain, and if it’d been anything else, I
would’ve said of course I can forgive you. But this, this was huge. I might have to look into the face of
what they did…a child. I was supposed to be the father of her children, not Garrett.
No. No. No. No. Stop talking. I don’t want to hear this. Screaming this out in my head did no good
since Charlie continued on.
“I know I didn’t use a condom with Garrett, and that’s why I’m thinking he’s the father. I’m so sorry,”
she said again.
“Sorry? Sorry?” I whispered as my eyes barely opened. Focusing on her was difficult, but I was
awake. No longer drifting in nothingness.
“Oh my God. Mitch, you’re awake.”
“Awake,” I said, astonished, my voice coming through a little stronger.
Charlie attempted to hug me, lying her body over my torso. I didn’t hug her back. I felt weak, and I
really couldn’t move my body much. Fucking muscle atrophy.
“Pregnant? Garrett’s baby?” Why was it so hard to talk?
Tears streamed down her face. “Yes,” she gasped out. “Mitch, I’m so sorry.”
“You said that.” My tone was biting. My breathing had accelerated and words were beginning to flood
my mind. “This is worse than a coma. I could pretend you didn’t sleep together. Now it’s all just a fuckedup
reality. How could you do this to us, Charlie?”
Charlie’s sobs only made me angrier. She had no right to cry. All of this was her fault. I was so angry I
could tear this room apart…that is, if I could move. My body wasn’t exactly complying with my mind.
“I don’t know how everything’s gone so wrong, but you’re right, it is all my fault. I let Garrett take care
of me when you didn’t remember us. He comforted me and I needed him. I had no idea he wanted me. But
you broke up with me and then I saw you and Heather at the Italian restaurant. I think I drank two bottles
of wine all by myself.”
She grabbed a tissue and wiped her nose.
Her excuse was she needed comfort? Kate…Natalie…they couldn’t comfort her? She had to sleep
with my brother? I wanted to say all of this, but it was too exhausting. The words wouldn’t come out.
“I know it’s no excuse, but I was drunk and I thought Garrett was you. I woke up in the middle of the
night and…I really thought it was you and I had been having a terrible dream.”
I exhaled loudly. Through gritted teeth, I managed, “Leave.”
“Please let me stay. We need to talk, Mitch. I know we can get through this.”
I managed to shake my head. As if on cue, a nurse came in to check my vitals. Once she realized I was
awake, my room was swarming with medical professionals.
“I love you, Mitch,” Charlie said as she reached the door. I heard her, but didn’t acknowledge. I
couldn’t look at her.
Chapter Forty-Three
CHARLIE
My dad was waiting for me in the hospital lobby. He stood up when he saw me approaching.
“Sweetheart, what’s wrong? Did something happen to Mitch?”
“Yes, I happened.”
“I’m confused. What do you mean?” my dad asked with a puzzled look.
“Mitch woke up while I was telling him about the baby. Needless to say, he’s beyond angry. He
practically threw me out of his hospital room.”
My dad pulled me into his arms, my body shaking from my sobbing. At least my parents’ reaction to my
news had been met with tenderness. I’d only mustered the courage to tell them I was pregnant about a
week ago.
“It’s going to be okay, Charlie. Mitch will come to his senses once he’s had some time. You just have
to be strong and give him the time he needs right now. It’s going to be hard, but you can do it.”
“But what if he doesn’t? What if he never forgives me, Dad?”
“We’ll have to cross that bridge when we get to it. For now, don’t borrow trouble. Let’s get you home
so you can rest. You have a big day tomorrow.”
“What do you mean?”
“I got a call from the ADA that another trial lacked sufficient evidence, so it was dropped. They
moved Eric’s trial up to tomorrow. Both sides agreed they were ready.”
“Really,” I sighed, almost too tired to even care. I had to face Eric sometime. It might as well be
tomorrow. Could this day get any worse? Time was slipping away from me, going faster than I ever
thought possible.
“I’m sorry to give you more to handle.”
“It’s okay.”
My dad drove us home and I stared out the window aimlessly. Tears were still spilling out of my eyes
and I couldn’t seem to stop them.
When we got home, I lay down in my room and texted Kate and Natalie. I didn’t have it in me to talk to
them. Of course, they were both thrilled Mitch had come out of his coma, but they empathized with me
about our circumstances. I told them both I needed to just get through the trial and then I could focus on
getting Mitch to listen to me. They agreed. I figured Kate would have her say with Mitch when the time
was right. She’d always had a way of talking with him that was so helpful, just like when he was with
Heather.
I barely slept, feeling nervous about the trial starting in the morning. Entering the courthouse, I was
shaking like a leaf in a storm. I had to get a hold of myself and calm down before going on the stand.
Showing up with an entourage in tow, I gave a tight smile to the ADA, Jason Matthews, who seemed to be
making mental notes of who was in my party. It was only four people for goodness’ sake, but he didn’t
look happy. At least he was already familiar with my parents.
“Charlie, a surprise witness was added to the docket this morning. She’s a former girlfriend, testifying
for the defense.”
“Are you serious?” Kate asked.
“I’m afraid so,” Jason replied.
“What are you expecting her to say?” my dad wanted to know.
“I’m assuming she’ll say he was a good boyfriend and didn’t have any anger issues when she was with
him.”
I nodded slightly. What could I say? I had no idea if he’d been a good boyfriend to anyone else. I only
knew how he’d treated me.
I sighed. “Thanks for the heads up. Whatever happens here, I’m grateful Mitch wasn’t on the meds long
enough for them to cause any damage.”
“You have a good attitude. I don’t want your hopes to be too high because I’m pretty sure she’s here to
blow holes in our theory that he was motivated to get to you.”
A woman came up, handing Jason a file folder, and he excused himself, saying he’d see us inside the
courtroom in a few minutes.
I sat with my family and friends as I watched Eric being brought into the courtroom. He didn’t get out
on bail when he was arrested for tampering with Mitch’s drugs. He’d been in jail for the last few weeks.
Somehow, Eric had managed to hire one of the best defense attorneys in San Diego. Neil had told Kate
that I should be prepared for anything. Looks like the surprise witness was going to be that anything. After
I testified to the evening I saw him while getting Mexican food and painting the portrait of an abusive
boyfriend whom I was afraid of, she took the stand. Victoria Tate.
She was a beautiful blonde whom I’d never seen before. If I had, I would’ve certainly remembered.
“Miss Tate, how do you know the defendant, Eric Machado?”
“He’s been my boyfriend on and off for the last three years.”
“Are you currently dating now?”
“Yes, we recently started seeing each other again.”
Miss Tate, as she was called, went on to describe the perfect boyfriend who always put her first,
treated her well, and had never mentioned any ill feelings toward past girlfriends. She went on to say he
simply made a mistake when filling the prescription. She’d kept him up late the night before and he was
tired. The whole thing made me want to puke. For all I knew, he’d paid her to testify for him and
everything she said was a lie. I couldn’t wait for the lunch recess so I could get away from Eric and his
attempt to manipulate the court.
“I can’t believe the testimony from that woman,” Kate said as she was about to take a bite of her
sandwich.
“Surely the jury isn’t gonna believe her over you,” Natalie said, squeezing my hand.
Thank God my best friends were here for me. My parents were still paying for their lunch, so we had a
minute to ourselves.
“Who knows what’s gonna happen. Eric is like a cat. He always lands on his feet.”
“Regardless of what his girlfriend had to say, he’s the one who filled the prescription and I think he’ll
be found guilty.” Kate was right. No one else could be charged because Eric’s name was on the
prescription. It was all on him.
My parents joined us and they got Kate and Natalie talking about being married. It was a good
distraction from me being consumed with my own problems.
When we returned to the courtroom, the prosecution began calling Eric’s co-workers up to the stand.
One by one, they each gave a glowing report about his impeccable work ethic and that he was diligent in
his job. He’d never made a mistake like this before and had even caught mistakes made by others. At first
I thought their testimony was helping to make him look good, but then I realized it was giving credence to
how competent he was and it was highly unlikely for him to make such a mistake.
Eric glanced back at me several times, but I didn’t make eye contact. From my peripheral vision, I saw
him whispering to his attorney. It made me wonder what would happen next because if there was one thing
I knew about Eric, he was cunning.
When Jason finished with his last witness, Eric was called to the stand to testify. His attorney didn’t
look happy, but he began questioning him just the same.
“Mr. Machado, did you have malicious intent when you filled the prescription for Mitch Hawkins?”
Eric looked me in the eyes before he began answering. I couldn’t help looking back at him, surprised at
what I was seeing. Remorse. I had no idea if he was being genuine or not, but he seemed sorrowful
somehow.
“At first, no,” he said, looking down for a moment. “But then I spoke privately with Mrs. Hawkins,
Mitch’s mother.”
“What was communicated during that conversation?”
“Mrs. Hawkins made it clear she didn’t want Mitch to remember his old life with Charlie, that he
belonged with his girlfriend from high school. At that moment, all I could think about was how I belonged
with Charlie, so I said I could switch the medication, which could cause delays in recovery.”
“Then what medication did you dispense to Mr. Hawkins?”
“Mitch Hawkins had retrograde amnesia, and there is no medication prescribed that can bring back
memory. However, what I gave him, Tramadol, a narcotic-like pain reliever, can have side effects of
headaches and nausea, the result of which can cause a patient to have difficulty concentrating. I mixed in
Anavar, Clomid, and Cytomel to give him roid rage, hoping to delay his recovery even further. His doctor
had prescribed Co-codamol, which is a compound analgesic consisting of codeine phosphate and
paracetamol—basically, a low-grade, pharmacy issued painkiller. Mrs. Hawkins was very pleased and
agreed it’d be for the best.” There was a quiet mumbling around us at that revelation. I couldn’t look back
at her. I simply couldn’t.
“So, in your estimation, the drugs you gave Mr. Hawkins would induce side effects like headaches and
nausea, slowing his recovery and potentially thwarting the regaining of his memory?”
“Yes.”
I sat there dumbfounded that Eric was probably telling the truth, but even more astounded Lillian had
struck a deal with him. I couldn’t decide who was the devil, him or her. I knew she hated me, but I never
in a million years thought she would’ve risked Mitch’s health to get me out of his life. I couldn’t listen to
any more, so I got up and quickly made my way out of the courtroom.
I caught a glimpse of Lillian sitting in the last row, her hand covering her mouth. I glared at her. She
made eye contact with me for a brief second and if I could’ve breathed fire on her, I would’ve. The guilty
expression on her face said it all. Eric was telling the truth. But if there was anyone more cunning than
Eric, it was Lillian. Somehow I knew in my heart she’d find a way out of paying for this crime. Edward
sat next to her, shaking his head, disbelief spreading across his face.
Sitting on a nearby bench, I rested my head in my hands and began crying. All of this deception to keep
me away from her son. What kind of a monster is she? The courtroom doors opened and Lillian walked
past me in a hurry. No doubt, attempting to escape being arrested. So many things raced through my mind
that I wanted to say to her, but in the end, I decided she wasn’t worth the energy it would take right now to
say them. I just watched her walk away down the hall until she was gone.
My dad joined me on the bench and wrapped his arms around me. I cried all over his shoulder. He
didn’t say anything; he just comforted me like he’d been doing every time I fell in my life. He’d help me
back up and give me the strength to continue on, no matter what the circumstances. He’d been my rock and
my hero as far back as I could remember.
“Sweetheart, it’s all going to be okay,” he said in a soothing voice.
I looked up at my dad. “How? How’s it going to be okay?” I didn’t believe it and I needed an
explanation.
My dad didn’t say anything. He just stared at me with great concern in his eyes. “This may sound
hollow to you, but I have faith God is going to work all of this out.”
“I just have to have faith. Things worked out for Kate and Natalie. I’m going to do my best to be
positive. It’s just so difficult right now,” I said, slightly shaking my head.
“I know it is, sweetheart. But you don’t need a mountain of faith, just a small mustard seed.”
I thought about all the times my dad had walked me into Sunday school. He raised me to believe in
God. Now, I was being tested and I had to rely on my faith to carry me through this trial…not just the one
going on a few feet away, but the one where the man I loved may never want to see me again.
Mitch being so angry with me, never looking into my eyes again, never laughing with me, never holding
me, was way worse than anything Eric or Lillian could cook up. The thought of not spending my life with
him made me cry even harder against my dad’s chest. He squeezed me tighter and rested his chin on my
head.
“Mitch is going to find his way back to you, Charlie. I believe he’ll forgive you. Trust me.”
“I hope you’re right, Daddy. I need him back so desperately.”
“He needs you too, sweetheart. He needs you too.”
Chapter Forty-Four
MITCH
Hearing footsteps coming near, I wondered who was visiting me. Hopefully someone I wanted to
see…Kate, Natalie. Nope. The perfume said it all. It was my mother.
I had purposely instructed the hospital not to notify my parents I was awake. I wasn’t in the mood to
deal with my mother just yet, so pretending for a day or so was what I intended to do. Plus they’d kept me
busy for hours with tests and probing. The doctors seemed surprised I was able to have coherent thoughts
and communicate so clearly so quickly. They attributed it to my age and good physical condition.
“Mitch, I have something to tell you. I want you to hear it from me and not someone else,” my mother
said, her voice quivering.
What the fuck now? I was so tired of being an emotional punching bag. I waited because there was
nothing else I could do even though part of me wanted to shock the crap out of her.
“I did a terrible thing. I was just looking out for you and Heather, trying to protect your relationship.
You have to understand,” she gasped.
Understand what? She was beginning to freak me out. I wanted her to get on with whatever she had to
say, but she was crying, so it could take a while. It was a lot harder pretending to be in a coma than I
thought it would be. I wanted to yell at her to get on with it.
“Remember when we went with Heather to fill your prescription? Well, I didn’t want you to have the
medication the doctor prescribed, so I made a deal with the pharmacist, Eric, and he gave you something
else. I just wanted you to be with Heather and for Charlie to be out of your life. But Eric got caught and is
on trial for drug tampering. He just testified in court that I’m part of this. Of course, I can finagle my way
out of it, I always do. But I just had to tell you, Mitch.”
Now was the time to open my eyes. “Really? You knowingly had that psycho give me something other
than what the doctor prescribed because you wanted me to be with Heather? Have you lost your mind,
Mother?”
My mother stared at me with her mouth gaping open. It was the first time I’d ever seen her speechless.
What a welcome relief.
“Mitch, you’re awake. It’s a miracle. I need to get the doctor.”
“I woke up yesterday. I just didn’t want to deal with you yet. I was already pissed at you for bringing
Heather back into my life. But now? Now I just want you out of here. Out of my life. You risked my health
and happiness to have your way. What kind of a mother are you? Not one I want to have anymore.”
“Mitch, please…please just hear me out. I was doing what was best for you.”
“What was best for me? Are you kidding? You were doing what you wanted for you. It’s always been
that way. You’ve controlled me for the last time and I don’t want to have anything to do with you.”
“Mitch, you can’t mean that. I’m your mother.”
“Stop reminding me. It sickens me to know you. I heard you and Heather talking at the house. You took
her to get an abortion. I thought she’d aborted my child. But that’s not the worst of it. It was someone
else’s baby and you knew. You betrayed me then, just like now. You wanted me to be with a viper just like
you. Dad’s suffered for years being married to you, a woman who never loved him. You’re vile and you
make me sick. Get out.” My mother didn’t move. She stared at me dumbfounded. “Did you hear me? I said
get out.”
She got up and slowly made her way to the door. “In time you’ll see I was only doing what was best
for you, Mitch.”
Before I could say anything else, she went through the door.
My nostrils flared as I exhaled. Best for me? She was out of her mind. Nothing she’d done was with
my best interest at heart. I was hurt. I was in pain. Not physically, but emotionally. It felt as though I’d
been in some nightmare. The fall, Heather, my mother, the fight with Garrett, the attack, and now the drug
tampering. Plus Charlie’s pregnancy. I have no real idea how much time had elapsed, but I just wanted it
all to go away.
***
Kate and Neil came into focus as I opened my eyes. My friends. Kate had always been a true friend
and I’d always trust her.
She rushed over to me and grabbed onto me. “You’re awake. I’m so happy to see those blue eyes of
yours.”
“I’m happy to see you too. I’m out of my subconscious nightmare, now in the reality of what’s all gone
down.”
“What do you mean? Do you have all your memories back?”
“Yes, and I heard everything that was said to me. I remember everything.”
Neil came around to the other side of the bed. “Man, so good to see you on the mend.”
“Thanks,” I said, shaking Neil’s hand. “I’m not sure how I’m going to mend from all of this. My brain
is on overload.”
Neil nodded. “It’s going to take time. Healing always does. We’ll be here for you every step of the
way.”
A nurse came in to take me to physical therapy, ending our visit. Kate promised to come back
tomorrow. She knew I needed to talk with her. Thank God I had her.
Chapter Forty-Five

The trial was over and I wished things would get back to normal, but I had a feeling it’d be a long road
to normal. Eric had cut a deal with the ADA at lunch that day, giving up Lillian for a lesser sentence.
She’d been arrested and was facing her own trial. Eric was sentenced with three years since Mitch had
woken up and a doctor testified he didn’t have any issues from the drugs Eric had prescribed.
Mitch. My man had been through so much. He was still in the hospital and going through rehab to
regain his strength. The plan was for him to stay with Kate and Neil when he was released. Kate was
doing everything in her power to remain neutral and be both of our friends, which was a difficult task to
say the least, and she must have felt like she was walking a tightrope. I was grateful he’d be staying with
her because if anyone had a chance to help him forgive me, it was her. She knew a thing or two about
forgiveness, having been through her own struggles when David died.
My dad had taken me to the doctor and I was almost four months pregnant. He’d been doing everything
for me that I had hoped Mitch would do when we had our child, but I knew Mitch wasn’t in a place to see
me, let alone take care of me. I was fortunate to have my parents. Moving back home with them was a
huge help and would be even more so when the baby came.
Baby. I was going to be a mother soon to an innocent baby. My love for my little nugget was boundless,
and I was beginning to understand how much my parents loved me. In some ways, I couldn’t wait. My
mom had been taking me shopping on weekends and we were preparing the guest bedroom as a nursery. If
only…if only Mitch could be here with me to enjoy this time.
“Charlie,” I heard someone say. I turned around at my desk and saw Chip standing in the doorway.
“Hey, Chip.”
“Did I catch you at a bad time?” he asked.
“No, just a little daydreaming,” I said, hoping he wouldn’t read into my staring out my office window
in the middle of the day.
“Sometimes those are the best dreams,” he said, coming toward me. “I need to do some updates on
your computer. Is now a good time? It’ll only take a couple of minutes.”
“Sure. I have a couple of things I can do out of my office. The computer is all yours.”
“Great,” he said, but didn’t smile.
I walked out of my office, wondering if Chip had ever had a girlfriend. He didn’t seem to have the
normal social skills, but he made up for it in his brilliance with computers. He was a critical team
member and we’d be lost without him some days. He was a nice guy and I wished I knew someone I
could fix him up with.
Chapter Forty-Six
MITCH
May
Staying with Kate and Neil had been a godsend to say the very least. I didn’t want to live where
Charlie and I had been living and there was no way I was going to live at home. My mom had gotten out
on bail, but her trial would be starting sometime in the next six weeks. Dad had moved out and filed for
divorce. Finally. Maybe he could carve out some happiness in his life without her. He sure hadn’t found
any with her.
Sitting at the table with Kate and Neil having dinner, I couldn’t help but feel a pang for Charlie. My
heart was broken but I missed her desperately. We’d been inseparable for so long—being without her
here was strange. That didn’t mean I was getting back together with her or had gotten over the fact that my
brother’s baby was currently growing in her belly. The thought of it made me sick.
Kate and Neil talked about their day while I remained quiet. I had returned to work, but nothing was
the same as before my accident. Everything was different and I knew I was different. The doctor had told
me head trauma patients could change, and not be themselves anymore.
“Mitch, how was your day?” Kate asked, bringing me out of my reverie.
“It was…okay,” I said. The same old, same old.
Kate sized me up pretty quickly, like she always did. “You’re allowed to miss her, you know.”
Neil looked at me, then at Kate. “Kate, he probably doesn’t want to talk about it,” he said, coming to
my rescue.
Kate tilted her head and gave me her gracious smile. “You don’t have to talk, but it would be good for
you if you did. Bottling it all up isn’t gonna help—it only makes matters worse.”
I mulled over what Kate was saying. She was right. I knew she’d worked hard to get over losing David
and I had to do some work too, to figure things out.
“You’re right. I do need to talk.”
Kate’s face gleamed with excitement, probably because she thought she was finally getting through to
me.
“Neil, do you have time to hang out for a while after dinner?”
“Yeah, man. I’ve got all the time in the world.”
Kate no longer looked so pleased with herself, but I knew she was glad I’d talk to Neil.
After clearing the plates from the table, Neil and I headed out to the terrace and gazed out at the ocean
for a couple of minutes.
“I miss her, Neil.” I couldn’t believe how choked up I sounded. But I was choked up and missing my
girl even though I was angry with her.
“Mitch, the only thing stopping you from being with her is you.”
“I know, but…I haven’t gotten over the betrayal.”
“Maybe it’s not something you get over. Maybe you have to decide to move past it.”
I thought about what Neil was actually saying—let it go. But how?
“You have to ask yourself this: Is the betrayal more powerful than the love you two have shared?”
I soaked in Neil’s question. He had a good point. “You always give me something to think about.”
“I try,” he said, nodding slightly. “Do you think Charlie would forgive you if the situation were
reversed?”
“I’d like to think she would,” I said, running my hand through my hair. Now I knew why Neil was so
good at being a lawyer. He knew how to cut to the core of the matter.
“I’m not suggesting forgiving this would be easy. It’s not. It’s damn hard, but is your relationship with
her worth it?”
“Here I thought I was gonna do the talking, but you have stumped me with your questions.”
Neil laughed. “Sorry, man. I’m here to listen. I just want to help in any way I can. But Mitch, I have to
say this. Charlie would never intentionally cheat on you. And, it was only days after you fell that Garrett
moved in on her. So, if you had sex right before your accident, it’s possible the baby is yours. But, you
need to decide here, man, whether she cheated or was actually manipulated. And does that make a
difference in how you see her?”
“I know you’re right. The baby could be mine and my brother did take advantage of Charlie when she
was compromised. I’ve just needed some time to get my head on straight. I’m not completely sure it’s
Charlie I feel the most anger toward. She isn’t a girl who would manipulate or cheat on me. Intellectually,
I know this. But imagining her with Garrett just rips me apart. I’m sure you can understand.”
“Of course. You’ve had more come at you in the last few months than most people have in a decade.
Take whatever time you need.”
“Thanks, man. You and Kate have been great. I appreciate you letting me stay here and being here for
me. It means a lot.”
“Absolutely. You’re welcome to stay as long as you want.”
“Thanks. You’ve given me a lot to think about.”
After talking with Neil, I went to my room. Knowing Charlie was hurting over what was happening
between us didn’t make me feel good. I hated what we were both going through. I hated everything that
happened from the moment I fell off her dad’s ladder. If that hadn’t happened, we’d be married right now,
enjoying our lives. Instead, we were in a huge mess and I didn’t know where to begin to clean it up.
If only I hadn’t listened to my mother when she brought Heather back into my life. Of course, I’d asked
for Heather, not knowing any better. It was hard for me to distinguish who I was angrier with: my mother,
Heather, Charlie, Garrett, or myself. Maybe it was a tie. We were all participants in this whole ugly
situation. But the person who got the shortest stick was Charlie. I had to figure out if I could get past what
she and Garrett had done. Or rather, what Garrett had done with her. Doing it sooner rather than later
would be good. We had a time limit: resolve prior to the baby’s birth.
I took the anxiety pill the doctor prescribed. At least I could sleep if I had it. Sleep was the only
escape, and I was finding I wanted more and more of it. Perhaps I needed a change of scenery. The Dallas
office was beginning a special project that was supposed to take a couple of months, and I was more than
qualified for the job. It’d be good to sink myself into something new and challenging. It could give me
time to get my head on straight. Maybe it was just what I needed.
Neil’s words were still running through my mind. No matter what I did, I felt life would never be the
same.
Chapter Forty-Seven
She’s so beautiful. Her smile, her eyes, her sweet heart. I hadn’t thought she could be more amazing,
but growing the baby inside of her makes her glow. I can’t live without her. I won’t live without her.
We’re meant to be together, and we will be soon. I’ll do whatever it takes to make her mine.
No more sorrow for you, Charlie. No more sadness. What Mitch couldn’t provide, I’ll make up for.
I’ll love and care for you forever.
Everything was planned. All I had to do now was execute it. I could hardly wait to have her all to
myself and love her the way she deserved.
Chapter Forty-Eight
CHARLIE
June
I was grateful Mitch was staying with Kate and Neil, but it hurt so much not to see him. He’d asked for
some time to sort through everything: David’s death, his brother’s betrayal, his mother’s betrayal on so
many levels, recovering from his injuries, and me. He needed space from me. All I could do was what he
asked. Even though it hurt like hell.
Sitting to eat breakfast, my belly bumped the table and I felt the baby move. I gently rubbed my belly in
a soothing manner and my little nugget settled down. With each bite I took of my cereal, I thought more
and more about setting things right in my life. Time was marching on and forgiveness was the only way I
could think of to set myself free. My baby deserved a mother who could love completely, not an angry one
because of the things that had happened to her. All I wanted was to give my child the very best I could.
The best of me. Nothing short of that would do.
My mind was made up. I was visiting Eric today. For my health, I needed to forgive him. That didn’t
mean I’d buy into his manipulations, but doing this would be a gift to myself and my nugget. Placing my
bowl in the sink, I had a brief chill come over me considering how hard it might be to face a man that had
caused me so much grief. But it had to be done and I wasn’t putting it off another day.
My parents had gone out shopping, so I could do this without any objection from them. I knew they
wouldn’t want me to face Eric alone, but I was a grown woman about to have a baby. It was time for me
to stand on my own two feet.
It’d be the first time since the break-in that I went anywhere alone. I’d come to the conclusion even
though the perpetrator seemed familiar, perhaps the whole thing had been random and I didn’t know the
guy at all. At no time had I been or felt followed or watched. Of course, I’d be cautious and pay attention
to my surroundings. Writing a note for my parents, I was feeling the weight lifting off my shoulders at
making a decision to have some closure. Maybe I’d even work up the courage to talk to Mitch.
An hour later, I was at the prison talking to a guard about visiting Eric. After I handed over all of my
personal belongings, he brought me to a room with tables and chairs.
“Wait here,” he instructed.
I nodded, feeling a twinge in my stomach, not knowing what to expect. Bravery had encompassed me in
the morning, but now that the moment of truth was upon me, I wanted to get up and run for the hills.
As I contemplated fleeing, Eric was brought in. Saying he looked surprised to see me was a gross
understatement. Seeing him made me realize I was doing the right thing and I’d feel good about this
afterward.
“Charlie, what are you doing here?” he asked sheepishly.
“I thought we could talk,” I said, summoning courage from the crevices of my soul.
“Absolutely. Anything you want.”
“I have a question. Well, probably more than one.”
“I’ll answer anything you ask. But can I say something first?”
“I guess,” I said, bracing myself for one of his tactics. Manipulation came as naturally to him as
breathing.
“I know this isn’t enough, but I’m sorry. I’ve been nothing but an ass to you and you deserve so much
better. Can you ever forgive me for the terrible things I’ve done to hurt you?”
Staring at him, my inclination was to wonder what he had up his sleeve. But I’d come here for the sole
purpose of forgiving him and he was sitting here before me asking.
“Yes, Eric. I forgive you. That’s one of the reasons I came today. I don’t want any grudges in my life
since I’ll be a mother soon.”
“Thank you,” he said. I could tell he wanted to reach out to me, but that was against the rules. I was
grateful we had a table between us and guards watching. I might be able to forgive, but I wasn’t going to
forget all he put me through both in the past and in recent months.
“So, what are your questions?”
“I really want to know why you sold out Lillian. You had a chance of maybe getting away with
tampering with Mitch’s drugs. I could tell your lawyer wasn’t happy.”
Eric leaned back in his chair and pursed his lips together. “I looked back at you and could see your
pain. I knew the plea deal was still on the table, so I decided to do the decent thing for once in my life.”
I soaked in his words, uncertain of whether or not to believe him, but no ulterior motive came to mind.
“I’m not sure what to say. Thank you for telling me the truth. Lillian would have gotten away with it if
you hadn’t.”
“You didn’t deserve what she and I did to you and Mitch. My anger and need for control took over and
I did something that has ruined my life. My pharmaceutical license has been revoked.”
Part of me wanted to feel sorry for him, but I was never quite sure if he was being real, or just working
me.
“Anything else you wanted to know?”
“Yes, was our meeting at the Mexican restaurant random or on purpose?”
“Charlie, you’re so sweet,” he said somewhat smugly. “Don’t you know me better? Of course it was on
purpose. Somehow I’d deluded myself into thinking that I could get you back if Mitch were out of the way.
Bumping into you was part of the plan.”
“Wow, if only you used all your brainpower for good…” I said, trailing off.
“Instead of evil?”
“Yeah.”
“I know. But old habits die hard. I learned how to treat women from watching my dad control my mom.
As a kid, I hated how he treated her, but by the time I became a teenager, I was just like him. Now I’m a
man and I have to own up to my mistakes.” He stopped for a brief moment, almost assessing what he was
saying. “I’m so glad you came to visit me today and have generously forgiven me.”
I nodded slightly. “You never talked about your parents’ relationship when we were together.”
“Well, I didn’t want you to figure things out and leave me, but you left anyway. I got out of control with
manipulating you.”
The guard informed us visiting hours were over. I’d gotten more than I bargained for with Eric asking
for me to forgive him and being so forthright. It seemed so out of character.
“Thank you for answering my questions. I guess I better go.”
As I stood, Eric said, “You’re gonna make a great mom. Mitch is really lucky.” His eyes were
glistening and I could see him straining to hold back his emotions.
“Thank you,” I said, quickly turning, practically running for the door. Eric had no idea his kind words
were like daggers stabbing my heart and the last thing I wanted to do was get emotional in front of him.
The guard handed back my personal belongings and another text came through. Three missed calls and
four texts. Clearly my parents were worried. Reading the texts, I smiled to myself knowing I would’ve
been worried too if my little nugget had to face someone like Eric. But a huge burden had been lifted off
my shoulders by talking to him today.
I texted my dad letting him know everything was all right and I was leaving the prison now. I’m sure
they’d be upset with me when I got home, but it was too late for them to have stopped me. I was glad I’d
made this decision to see Eric.
When I walked through the door, both my parents got up to hug me. My dad whispered, “Please don’t
scare us like that again.”
“I’m sorry, Dad. I just had to get closure where Eric was concerned. I can’t have anything hanging over
my head.”
“We understand,” said my mom. She tugged at my dad’s arm softly and my dad nodded.
“I still have unfinished business I need to take care of…with Mitch. I’ve given him his space, but I
think it’s time he and I talked.”
“What are you going to do?” my mom asked.
“I’m going to just show up at Kate’s house and make Mitch talk to me. He can’t hide from me forever.
He might be angry with me, but I know he still loves me.”
“He does love you. You’ve given him time. Now you need to fight for what you want. It might take
everything you have to get him to listen to you.”
“Good thing you made me a fighter, Dad. I’m going to go over right now.”
***
Arriving at Kate’s house, my hands were shaking and my heart felt constricted. Getting Mitch to talk to
me may be one of the hardest things I’d ever have to do, but I wasn’t going to let that stop me. Turning off
the car, I wrapped my arms around myself before getting out. I knew there was the possibility Mitch may
say hurtful things if he were still angry, or worse, say nothing at all.
As I knocked on the door, a rush of heat surged through me and I felt a little clammy, sweat appearing
at the back of my neck and underarms. Too late to go home and take another shower now. This might
prove to be harder than I thought.
Neil answered. “Charlie, great to see you. Kate didn’t tell me you were coming over tonight. Come
in,” he said, opening the door widely.
“Kate doesn’t know. I’m here on a whim.”
“Oh, well, she’s out doing some shopping. But I expect her to be back soon. I can text her that you’re
here.”
“Actually, I came over to see Mitch. He and I really need to talk. Get some things out in the open. I
hope he’s willing to listen to me.”
Neil’s face dropped. “Why don’t you have a seat? Can I get you something to drink?”
“Water would be great.”
“Coming right up.”
I sat on the sofa while Neil played host. He returned with a somber look on his face and sat beside me.
Looking at him, I could tell he had something to say, but maybe didn’t know where to start.
“Is Mitch here?” I asked.
“No, Charlie. He’s gone.”
“What do you mean by gone? Where is he?”
“I hate to be the one to tell you, but he’s in Dallas.”
“Dallas?”
“Yes, his company has an important project they’re putting together and they offered him to be part of
it. He left yesterday.”
“Yesterday.” Time seemed to have slowed down—everything around me felt as though it was in slow
motion. Momentarily, I had thought I might get him back, but now it felt as though he was really gone. I
knew he loved me, but he wasn’t going to forgive me. How am I going to do this alone?
“He made Kate promise not to tell you.”
“Neil,” I said, my voice trembling. “Did he say it was over between us? Did he say anything?”
“Mitch and I had some long heart to hearts, but he didn’t give Kate or me a message for you if that’s
what you’re asking.”
I lay my head on the back of the sofa, no longer having the strength to keep it upright. “I don’t believe
this. How could he leave without telling me?”
“Charlie, Mitch needed to get away from things for a while. He’s overwhelmed by everything that’s
happened. He broke down a couple of times because of it. He just…he just needed this right now,” Neil
said, taking my hand. He was always so kind and I was glad Mitch had confided in him.
“Neil, how was Mitch handling what happened between Garrett and me? Did he share any feelings
about that? About what I’ve done?” As the words came out of my mouth, a searing pain ripped through my
abdomen, causing me to grab onto my stomach and cry out.
“Charlie, what is it? The baby?”
“I don’t know. I’m having a severe pain,” I said, then cried out again.
“I’m taking you to the hospital.” Neil scooped me up in his arms and began carrying me toward the
garage. He placed me in the backseat. “Just hang on, Charlie. I’ll have you there in no time.”
Shards of pain ripped through me again as I lay on the backseat. Neil was already driving and was
talking to someone.
“Yes, we’re on our way. She’s about five to six months pregnant. We’ll be there in ten minutes. Okay,
thank you.”
“What did they say?” I asked, almost screaming.
“Someone will meet us at the emergency entrance with a wheelchair. It’s going to be okay. Try to
relax.”
I didn’t answer Neil. Relax? Has he lost his fricken’ mind? There was way too much pain to relax.
But what did he know? He was a man.
Neil was right. He got me to the hospital faster than I thought possible. I was glad I was lying down
and not watching him drive. All I could concentrate on was the baby and what might be going wrong. My
skin prickled at the thought of something happening to my baby. It was way too soon for him or her to
enter this world.
Neil carefully got me out of the car and the nurse wheeled me into the emergency room. Another sharp
pain surged through me and I held my stomach as if that were going to help. I heard Neil behind me saying
he was going to get Kate and my parents here and not to worry.
All I could do was worry. I desperately wanted Mitch here with me, but he was gone. He’d run away
from me and our life together and there was nothing I could do about it. It felt like I was falling apart
everywhere. In my heart, in my mind, and now my body. When will this nightmare be over?
I was put into an exam room and a doctor came in immediately. He introduced himself, but I really
couldn’t concentrate on his name. He asked me a bunch of questions about what I was experiencing while
a nurse took my blood pressure. After thoroughly checking me out, he concluded I had Braxton Hicks
contractions due to stress. As I began calming down, the pain lessened.
Chapter Forty-Nine
MITCH
I was eager to make a good impression so I arrived to the office early. The opportunity to work with
the Dallas team had come at just the right time. Sinking my teeth into something new could help, and I was
only going to be here for a couple of months. Plenty of time to figure things out, I hoped.
I felt bad for not at least texting Charlie, but she probably knew by now from Kate that I was here. The
elevator doors opened and I was looking directly into my company’s lobby and the receptionist who was
on the phone. I walked up to her desk and waited for a moment.
“May I help you, sir?” she asked. It felt slightly strange to be called sir, but I was in Dallas where
people had old-fashioned values and manners.
“Good morning. I’m Mitch Hawkins. I’m here to report to Devin Sanders.”
“Yes, she’s expecting you, Mr. Hawkins. I’m Janet,” she said, extending her hand to shake mine. “Let
me direct you to her office.”
Janet got up and I followed her down the hall to the end corner office. “Ms. Sanders emailed me that
she was stopping on her way in, but to have you wait in her office.”
“Thank you, Janet,” I said. “And please call me Mitch.”
Janet smiled, but I had the feeling she’d be staying formal, even though she was old enough to be my
grandmother.
“Please make yourself comfortable. Would you like coffee or tea?”
“I’m good for right now, thanks.”
She nodded and began making her way back to her desk.
I took out my laptop and debated on the email I wanted to send Charlie. It would’ve been good if I had
written this last night, but I couldn’t find the words. She deserved some explanation, so I needed to buck
up and provide one for her.
Dear Charlie,
I’m sure by now Kate has told you I’m in Dallas. I needed a change of scenery to get my head on
straight. So much has happened and honestly I’m still messed up over it. I promise I’m not trying to
run away from you and I apologize for not talking to you directly before taking off. I still love you, but
I don’t know if I can be with you. Hopefully over the next couple of months I’ll be able to figure it out.
Please give me the chance to do that. I’d prefer if you don’t respond to my email or try to contact me in
any way.
Mitch
I hit the send button, knowing my letter was cold and would most likely cause Charlie more sadness,
but at least it was an explanation. I hadn’t contacted her since I woke up and found out about the
pregnancy. She’d texted me and left voicemails, but I wasn’t ready to speak with her. I took the cowardly
way out and had Kate relay that message to her.
“Mitch, hi. I’m Devin,” a tall, beautiful blonde woman said with an outstretched hand.
“It’s great to meet you, Devin,” I said, taking her hand in mine. She clearly wasn’t married and had
cougar written all over her.
“I’m glad you made it here all right. How are your accommodations?”
“They’re great. I’m sure I’ll be very comfortable for the next couple of months.”
“Glad to hear it. Everyone is looking forward to meeting you. We have an empty office across from
mine you’ll be working out of. Let me show you.” I followed Devin across the hall. “Why don’t you get
settled in for a few minutes and I’ll be back to get you for our meeting,” she said, looking at her watch.
“It’ll start in about ten minutes.”
“Great, thanks.”
Devin turned and walked out. I took out my laptop and cell. I hadn’t checked it since I turned it off on
the flight. There was something soothing about being a little off the grid. Once it came to life, I saw seven
text messages. All of them were from Kate.
Shit. What the hell is going on? Charlie’s in the hospital? As I scrolled my way down to the last one, I
was so relieved to read that Charlie’s contractions were a false alarm and she was okay. If anything
happened to her…
The feelings surging through me were so confusing. I wanted to go to her, comfort her, make her feel
safe, but at the same time the pain of what she did was still severe. Damn it. If only I could forget Garrett
was the baby’s father. This should be a wonderful time for us, planning to bring a child into the world, but
instead I was thousands of miles away, trying to decide if I could live with all that’d happened. Not just
live with it, but somehow forget my brother had sex with my fiancée. The image was just too hard to move
past. I knew Neil had said I could be the father, but I couldn’t go there. Not yet. Plus, with everything
that’d happened it was pretty clear I wouldn’t be that lucky.
My talks with Neil had been helpful, but maybe he was a bigger man than me with a larger capacity to
forgive. Hard to say since no one really knew what they’d do unless they were in my position. Does it feel
worse because I now knew Heather was unfaithful and aborted a child and had lied to me saying it was
mine? I just felt so wronged.
Devin popped her head in. “Ready?”
“Yes,” I said, getting up from my desk. We walked down to the other end of the floor and entered a
large conference room. Over half the seats were already taken. Devin and I sat down while additional
people were coming in to join the meeting. The chair directly across from me was vacant until…no, this
wasn’t happening. Heather. She sat down, placed her tablet in front of her, and looked straight into my
eyes. Her lips parted for a fraction of a second and her brow knitted together. Neither of us had a happy
look on our faces.
Devin must have noticed, because she leaned over and whispered, “Is everything okay?”
All I could do was nod. This was a disaster. How did Heather end up working for my company?
The meeting began and I mustered all my energy to focus. Would I ever catch a break? I had no clue
how Heather ended up here. I was beginning to feel paranoid when James, our director, announced it was
time to break for lunch. Lunch already? I must have missed half of what was going on from my mind
spinning out of control.
Devin told me a group of people was headed down to the sandwich shop on the first floor. I told her
I’d meet her there. I had the urge to check my email and see if Charlie had emailed me back. I was torn on
what I wanted her to do.
I’d no sooner sat at my desk than Heather showed up, walked in, and closed the door behind her.
“Did you follow me here, Mitch?” she asked curtly.
“What? I thought you followed me,” I shot back at her.
“I told you in the hospital I was moving to Dallas to be near my family. I just got this job and I don’t
want it to get messed up.”
“You told me when? When I was in a coma? And I’m supposed to know what you said?”
Heather paused for a moment and bit her lower lip. “I guess not.”
“I remember bits and pieces of what people said, but much of it is dreamlike. I can assure you I had no
idea you’d be here.” Why the hell would I remember anything she’d said?
Heather exhaled loudly. “That’s a relief.”
“I’m only here for this project. I should be gone in a month or two, so do you think we can manage to
be civil to each other while I’m here?”
“That shouldn’t be a problem. And if I wasn’t so freaked out that you’re here, I probably would’ve
asked you how everything is going. With Charlie, I mean.”
There was a loaded question. “We’re not together right now.”
Heather’s face looked contorted while she processed my statement. “But you two are meant to be
together, Mitch. She’s the one for you. I saw it the first time I met her.”
“Well, things are complicated.”
“Then un-complicate them. You can fix whatever the problem is. Don’t lose her. I know she can make
you happy. You deserve to be happy and you deserve a wonderful woman like Charlie.”
I wondered what Heather’s reaction would be when I told her. “Charlie’s pregnant and since she slept
with Garrett while I’d forgotten her, it’s most likely his baby.”
Heather took a deep breath and tilted her head, as if contemplating what I had just said. She didn’t
know Charlie, but she knew Garrett. Finally she answered, “Mitch, she made a mistake. You broke her
heart and Garrett was there. I’m not saying what they did was right, but are you really gonna punish her
and an innocent baby? She loves you, Mitch, and I know you love her too. Don’t blow this.”
“It’s just hard to get past. I’m not sure I can.”
“Mitch, if you wanna be mad at someone, aim your fury at me. If I hadn’t interfered, then you wouldn’t
have hurt Charlie. I was manipulating the situation to get you back. You should hate me.”
I stared at Heather, her eyes filled with tears. She was so sincere. I couldn’t hate her even if I wanted
to. “I don’t hate you, Heather, but that doesn’t mean I consider you a friend, either. I appreciate everything
you’re saying. I’ll take it into consideration.”
Heather stood up from her chair. “I know we’ll never be friends, but I’m right about this. Charlie is the
one for you and I only hope you see it before it’s too late. Try putting yourself in her shoes.”
Before I could say anything else, Heather walked out of my office. Taking a protein bar out of my brief
case, I leaned back in my chair and pondered what she’d said. Between her and Neil, I was getting the
advice to accept things, not let Charlie go. Heather’s words were spoken from a place of unselfishness.
She surprised me quite honestly. I half expected her to suggest we see each other, but she did me a solid
instead. I had no question that Neil had good intentions. He knew how happy Charlie and I had been
before all of this. I felt like my reason for coming here had just been revealed and it had nothing to do
with my job.
Chapter Fifty
CHARLIE
July
It had been weeks since Mitch had basically vanished. I had read his email over and over again. I felt
obsessed with his words. He was gone and I had no idea if he’d really come back. It was the only
communication he’d given me and as much as I wanted to email, call, text, go out and see him, I didn’t.
Time was moving at a glacial pace and my heartache wasn’t going away. My belly kept growing and I did
everything in my power to focus on my baby. Now that I was six months along, things felt very real to me.
This was actually happening and I was going to be a single mother. I had a lot of respect for women who
had to do it alone. I was fortunate enough to have my parents who wanted to be involved in my life and
the baby’s. No matter what happened, my child would be loved.
My parents had gone to get Chinese takeout for us. They often did that on Saturday nights. It was
tranquil to be alone for a few minutes and reflect on my life, but my solitude didn’t last long, as there was
a knock at the door.
For a brief second, I thought it was strange, but it was probably just someone trying to sell something.
“Who is it?” I called out before I looked through the peephole.
“It’s the Orkin man. We have a special this week.”
I froze in my tracks. That voice. It was him. The same voice I’d heard outside my apartment, the same
man who had broken in. I looked through the peephole, but he was wearing a baseball cap with the word
Orkin on it. I must’ve been paranoid or having some kind of flashback. Then I stepped over to the window
and saw an Orkin truck outside. Come on, Charlie. Get a grip.
I opened the door, about to tell him I could take a flyer for my dad, when his hand covered my mouth
and nose with some sort of cloth and his other hand grabbed me around the neck. Struggling was useless
as I felt myself losing consciousness. Looking into the eyes of my assailant, I was astonished. His face…
***
Opening my eyes, I tried to focus, but it was very difficult. I felt hazy and couldn’t quite focus on
anything. Why was the room spinning? Not spinning. Bobbing? Feeling and hearing the waves lap against
the side of the boat, I realized I was on the ocean. I attempted to move myself to look out the window, but
my hands and feet were bound and I was having trouble maneuvering myself with my belly in the way.
What the hell was happening and why was I here?
It all came rushing back to me. Opening the door, passing out…but the startling part was recognizing
the man who’d taken me. Chip. None of this made any sense. I always thought he was a good guy, but Chip
was the one who’d broken into my townhouse and had taken me now. My mind began racing with all of
the possible scenarios of what could happen to me on this boat. None of them were good. Breaking out in
a sweat, I began taking deep breaths in an attempt to calm myself. Survival had to be my top priority.
I looked down at my belly, hoping whatever I had inhaled hadn’t affected my baby. What was going to
happen to us? What if Chip hurt my little nugget? Looking around the small cabin, I hoped to see
something that would eventually help me to free myself. Everything was neat and tidy. I couldn’t see
anything that would help me. Chip was nowhere in sight, but at some point I was certain he’d show up. At
least he’d bound my hands in front of me and not behind. The rope was cutting into my flesh, so I tried to
keep as still as possible. The bobbing, however, moved me, making the rope cut me a little each time.
I’d always thought Chip was a little unusual, not possessing the normal social graces of the average
person. I had no idea, however, that he was capable of kidnapping or worse. He seemed to appreciate that
I went out of my way to be nice to him when some of the other women working at the company didn’t give
him the time of day. Obviously, that had no meaning now as I was tied up and alone on his boat.
My parents must’ve been wondering where I was, but I had no idea how long I’d been gone. I wasn’t
wearing my watch at the time he took me. Sadly, it would take forty-eight hours before the police would
begin searching for me. No one would have any idea how to find me because no one knew about Chip. My
heart sank at the realization that unless I figured a way out of here, this would most likely be the last place
I’d ever see.
I heard creaking of the floorboards and had the sinking feeling Chip would be appearing any moment.
The door opened, and Chip stuck his head in.
“Charlie, you’re awake. Welcome aboard.”
Was he kidding? He sounded like I was a guest, not here against my will. My options were to act
indignant, or be nice and see what he did. I didn’t know how to play this. Shit.
“Can I get you anything? Something to drink, perhaps?”
“I’d love some water,” I said, unsure if I should take anything he gave me, but my baby was going to
need food and water.
“Coming right up. Sorry to have you tied up, but it just can’t be helped right now.”
“Chip?”
“Yes,” he said, turning back to look at me.
“Why have you brought me here?”
“So we can be together, silly. Like we always talked about. But you were with Mitch, so we had to
wait.”
Oh, no. It was worse than I thought. He was delusional.
“I see. But you know I’m gonna have a baby, right?”
“Yes, our child is going to have a wonderful life. We’re going to sail the world and show him
everything.”
Now I had no idea what to say. The one psychology class I took in college didn’t prepare me for this.
“The baby and I are gonna need some things before we go on a trip. Do you think I could go home and
pack?” I asked, hoping that playing along was the right move.
“I’d be happy to go to your house and pack some things for you. I can do it late tonight.”
My parents. Shit. What if he hurt my parents?
“Let me think about what I might need. Maybe I can just get things as we go.”
“That’s probably a good idea, Charlie. I’d hate to see what would happen if your overprotective father
and I crossed paths.”
His veiled threat struck my heart. I couldn’t risk Chip hurting my family. Not if I could prevent it.
Chip handed me a glass of water. “Would you like something to eat? I picked up some Chinese food. I
have your favorite,” he said, waggling his brow.
“How do you know my favorite?” I asked, trying to keep my voice steady.
“I’m very observant. I’ve learned a great deal about you. I plan on knowing every detail.”
I nodded. I was starving, so eating Chinese sounded good. “I could eat, if it’s not too much trouble.”
Damn it, I sounded like I didn’t have a backbone. Come on, Charlie. You’re only going to survive this if
you take control.
“I’ll be right back. I left it up on deck.”
Chip vanished through the door with the promise of returning sooner than I wanted him to. How was I
going to get him back to reality? It was like I’d entered some other dimension.
Chip returned with a bag filled with Chinese food. I inhaled deeply, my stomach rumbling. As he began
taking the containers out of the bag, my mouth watered. I couldn’t remember ever being this hungry before.
Chip brought me a plate of food, and it was what I always ordered: mushroom chicken. He’d clearly
been studying me. The strange thing was I couldn’t recall getting Chinese food for lunch or ever going out
for it with the people I worked with. It was usually something I got to eat on Friday nights with Mitch.
“It smells delicious. Thank you,” I said, not knowing what else to say. “Could you untie the ropes so I
can eat?”
“I think I’ll be feeding you tonight,” he said, scooping up a fork full to give me.
I opened my mouth and let Chip feed me like I was a toddler. What choice did I have?
Chapter Fifty-One
MITCH
My phone lit up. It was Neil. I had a meeting in a few minutes and I almost ignored his call, but
something told me I needed to answer it.
“Hey, man. What’s up?”
“Mitch, is Charlie with you by chance?”
Neil’s voice was strained, concerned, and it scared the shit out of me.
“No, why would she be here? What’s going on?”
“Charlie went missing yesterday. Her parents went out to get food. When they returned, her car was
there, but she wasn’t. They can’t find her. She didn’t take her phone or purse with her.”
“So, you think someone took her?”
“It’s possible. Charlie’s not the type to worry her family unnecessarily. She wouldn’t be this
irresponsible.”
“Yeah, you’re right,” I said, beginning to wrack my brain on possible reasons she was gone. Nothing
that made any sense came to mind.
“You may not remember, but someone did break into your place while you were in the coma. The cops
never found the guy. For all we know, he could have been stalking Charlie.”
“Shit, this is really serious.”
“Very. We need you to get back here. We’re going to need all the help we can get to find her. I’ve
already hired the team that protected Kate to help with tracking Charlie.”
“Thanks, Neil.”
“You and Charlie are family. I’ll do whatever it takes to find her. Kate is beside herself.”
“I wish I had an idea, but I really don’t. I’ll be on the first flight out. I’ll text you my flight info when I
have it.”
“Great, Mitch. We’ll pick you up at the airport.”
After hanging up with Neil, I began gathering my things. My plan was to go to the airport and get the
first flight to San Diego. I’d search airlines in the taxi ride there. Now I just had to inform my boss what
was happening.
Popping my head into Devin’s office, I was acutely aware my departure would be a problem. I
explained the situation while she stared at me the entire time, not blinking.
“Well, if you must go, you must go,” she finally said.
“I’ll keep in touch.”
“Okay, I hope it all works out and you find her. We’ll have to fill your spot on the project. I’ll message
your boss in San Diego and let him know you’re coming back.”
I nodded. “Thanks. It’s been great working with you and everyone here.”
Devin smiled. “You better go catch your flight.”
***
On the way to the airport, I found a flight on my phone. I had just enough time to check in and make a
run for the gate. Getting back to find Charlie was my only concern. During the flight, I was going to make
a list of any possible suspects I could come up with. So far, no one came to mind.
Boarding the plane was such a relief. Charlie missing was a dagger in my heart. I still loved the
woman. She was my girl and always would be. Why had I been wasting all this precious time? I couldn’t
change anything that had happened because of my accident and it certainly wasn’t Charlie’s fault. She was
a victim in all of this mess as well. Blaming her had been easy when I was angry, but the minute I heard
Neil on the phone, my anger disappeared. I was going to turn San Diego inside out if I had to. No one was
going to hurt Charlie if I had anything to say about it.
I got settled in my seat and took out a notepad and a pen. I just started writing the names of everyone
we knew, even people that would never hurt Charlie in a million years. I just wanted to get as many on the
list so I could start eliminating.
After a while, my anxiety meds kicked in. I always had to take them when I flew, so I put my list away
and leaned back with my eyes closed. Within moments, I was sleeping, dreaming I was back in the
hospital, in my coma.
Someone entered my room and I could sense their presence, smell their cologne, but they didn’t
speak. The scent clued me into the fact it was a man. A woman wouldn’t wear a woodsy scent like that.
Who was he and why wasn’t he talking? An uneasy sensation spread over me while I waited for
something to happen. I hated being vulnerable like this, unable to defend myself if I had to.
He came closer to me and hovered over me. What the hell do you want? My heart rate had increased
significantly, my instincts telling me something was very wrong. Then he whispered, “After I make her
mine, I’m coming back for you.”
Opening my eyes, I gasped. This was the first time I was remembering my visitor. But I didn’t know
who he was. Damn it. I had to think. I had nothing on my hands but time to think. All I had to go on was
his scent and voice. Closing my eyes, I worked at concentrating on his voice. I’d heard it before, but
maybe just a few times. He could be someone from anywhere we went. He wasn’t someone I knew well,
but maybe Charlie did. Could he be someone she worked with? I think I’d recognize voices from the gym
or anywhere else we went together. I’d gone to a few of her work functions.
I kept thinking, mulling through my ideas. Writing down everyone I could remember from her work, I at
least felt like I was doing something productive. I have to save my girl. She’d been through too much as it
was and I’d added insult to injury by leaving the way I did. All I could do was hope she’d understand
when I found her that I had to get away…from everything. But my talk with Heather in Dallas really
snapped me out of my fog. She reminded me what was important in life. Now I was going to have to fight
to have the life I wanted with my beautiful Charlie. I couldn’t lose her. That wasn’t an option.
Chapter Fifty-Two
CHARLIE
“Mitch,” I mumbled, waking up. My sorrow had grown so greatly since he’d left for Texas. Now, I
knew I’d never see him again unless I could find a way to escape. I didn’t even know if my parents had
contacted him or if he even cared I’d been kidnapped or worse. I’d hurt him so deeply because of my
immature, selfish act. If I could only rewind time…but that was impossible.
“Chip,” I called out. I thought he was on the deck above.
I heard him clomping down the stairs. “Yeah,” he said as he popped his head through the door.
“I really need to go to the bathroom. Could you help me?”
“Of course,” he said, coming inside the room. Chip walked over to the bed and picked me up. “I’ll
take you.”
“Will you please untie me so I can wipe myself?”
“If you can’t do it, I’ll do it for you.”
So many things came to mind in that split second. Not no, but hell no was one of them. I didn’t dare say
that, however, as I had no idea what would set Chip off.
“I’ll let you know if…if I can’t manage.” What else was I going to say? This guy was out of his mind.
Chip put me down inside the ridiculously small bathroom.
“I’ll be right out here if you need me,” he said, leaving the door open as he stepped away. Great. I
wasn’t going to get to pee in private. I wondered if I was going to spend the last of my days tied up here
on his boat. Despair draped over me, making me feel heavy and lethargic. Everything seemed hopeless as
I knew no one would have any clue as to where I was.
It took way too long to pee, since I knew he could hear me, but finally, my shy bladder complied and
when I was done, I managed to wipe myself. I had a feeling I was going to have a lot of managing to do. I
had no idea how long it’d take for Chip to trust me and take the rope off.
“Okay, I’m done,” I called out.
Chip returned. After he helped me up, I motioned toward the sink. “I’d like to wash my hands, please.”
“Of course, Charlie.” He said it in such an adoring way, I thought he might actually kiss me. But, I
didn’t give him a chance by sticking my hands under the faucet and turning my head away.
After that awkward situation was done, he carried me back to the bed.
“Can I get you anything?”
“I’d appreciate a glass of water.”
“Coming right up.”
Chip went up to the galley, returning a moment later with the water.
I was able to hold it in my two hands, even though my wrists were burning from the ropes.
“Looks like your wrists are hurting.”
“Yes, they really hurt,” I said, with hope that maybe I’d have some reprieve.
Chip took pity on me and began loosening the ropes.
“I’m only taking these off temporarily because I believe I can trust you. But if you do anything at all to
change that, the ropes go back on.”
“I understand. You won’t regret your decision,” I said, rubbing my left wrist with my right hand. Both
of my wrists were red and swollen.
“I have a few things to do before I go to work, so you can have the ropes off until I leave. I’ll come
back at lunch to check on you and we can eat together.”
“Okay, do you have anything for breakfast on the boat?”
“I’m sure I can come up with something for you. You stay put and I’ll be back in a few minutes.” He
bent down and stroked my hair. Goosebumps rose on my arms and my stomach flipped flopped. When he
touched my cheek, I had to hold in the vomit rising to my mouth. Please stop touching me.
I nodded. Staying put was the only thing I could do. I had to actually gain his trust before I could get
away from him. I knew I couldn’t physically fight him, no matter how much I’d worked out in the past.
Chip closed the door behind him and I peered around the room again. It was small and sparsely furnished.
The bed took up at least half the room. I opened the drawer of the nightstand next to me, but it was empty.
The bookshelf along the wall contained books, but it did have what looked like a heavy stone as a
bookend. That could come in handy if I could hit him hard enough over the head to knock him out. But my
confidence in defending myself was diminished by my little nugget being vulnerable. All Chip had to do
was deliver a hard blow to my belly and my baby could be hurt.
Okay, well I may not have had a perfect plan at this moment, but I had to come up with something
before we left town. Once I was out on the open sea with him, I’d have no escape. My heart sunk as I
realized I was at the mercy of Chip Peterman and his delusions about our relationship. Even more so now
that no one would have any idea where I was or with whom. I couldn’t see any way out of this situation,
and my heart ached with pain thinking I may not see any of my family and friends again.
Chapter Fifty-Three
MITCH
Neil had picked me up from the airport last night. His worry about Charlie kept his jaw tight and he
gripped the steering wheel with white knuckles. I couldn’t keep still in my seat, fidgeting the entire way to
his and Kate’s home.
I gave him my list of suspects and he faxed it over to his private investigator to start running
background checks even though it was late. I told Neil about my dream on the plane about my encounter
with whom I presumed was the man who’d taken Charlie. I just wished I had more details to figure out
who he was.
It wasn’t until the next morning that I could go over and see Charlie’s parents, and I hoped somehow
between us we’d figure all this out.
“Are you ready for this?” Kate asked me.
“As ready as I’m gonna be,” I said, opening the car door. Facing Charlie’s parents’ house, I knew her
parents may not be too happy to see the man who had caused their daughter so much pain. I had no idea
what to expect.
Kate and I approached the house.
“I’ve been such a selfish ass, Kate. They probably hate me.”
“No, they don’t. They love you. What’s happened between you and Charlie wasn’t anything intentional
on either of your parts. Tom is a level-headed man.”
I hoped Kate was right. I couldn’t take Charlie’s parents’ rejection. I’d been so close to them for so
many years. Tamera was like a mother to me, and I think I needed her even more now that I was aware of
all the things my own mother had done.
After pushing the doorbell, we both stood there. Reaching out and squeezing Kate’s hand, I said a
silent prayer that God would give Charlie back to me even though I’d foolishly tossed her aside.
“Thanks for being here with me, Kate.”
“There’s no place I’d rather be. You and I have to find Charlie. We’re her best shot.” Despite her
confident words, I could see from her tired and red-rimmed eyes that she was struggling to hold it
together.
The door opened, the grave look on Tom’s face pierced me. Had something else already happened?
“Thank God, Mitch. You’re here. Come in, you two.”
The minute I crossed over the threshold, Tom grabbed a hold of me and hugged me harder than anyone
ever had before.
“We’re going to find her, Tom,” I kept repeating over and over. I wasn’t sure if I was saying it to
assure him or myself. But I couldn’t fail my girl.
Tom nodded, looking too choked up to respond to me. “Tamera is making coffee.”
We followed Tom into the kitchen. Tamera hugged me before we sat around the dinette table, her eyes
teary. I knew neither of them had slept a wink since Charlie was taken. They looked exhausted. Looking at
Kate, Tom said, “I emailed my list to Neil of anyone I could come up with. I hope he gets a lead.”
Kate put her hand on top of Tom’s. “Neil’s guy is very good. He’s running background checks and has a
team going through the information they gather. Neil has rearranged his schedule to devote time to finding
Charlie. We’re all going to do everything to find her.”
Tom nodded, but he was too choked up to say anything to Kate.
“What did the police say?” I asked Tom.
Tom took in a sharp breath. “We have to wait for forty-eight hours before they can do anything. Sadly
with no leads, I’m not sure how much they can do.”
“They know she’s pregnant, right?” I asked, pissed that every man on the force wasn’t dedicated to
finding Charlie.
“Yes, they know. I contacted Charlie’s office and they’re working on lists of business contacts she has
interacted with as additional leads. Everyone is doing everything they can.”
“I know. I just…Tom, if I’d been here, none of this would be happening. Your daughter would be safe.”
Tom looked down. “We don’t blame you, Mitch. Someone took her and you had nothing to do with
that.”
“I just wish—”
“We all do. Beating yourself up over what’s already happened isn’t gonna change it. Charlie needs you
to be focused right now.”
I didn’t deserve his kindness, but the truth of the matter was I was grateful he’d always been a stand-up
guy and in my corner. Especially now. Something I never really received from my father.
“We’re going to head over to Charlie’s office and do some investigating of our own,” Kate informed
Tom and Tamera.
“That’s a really good idea,” Tamera said. “Even the smallest detail could be helpful in finding her.”
“Yeah, I have the feeling whoever took Charlie knows her well,” I said.
“We agree. I just hope we find her before he harms her or the baby,” Tom said, tears welling up in his
eyes.
“We will, Tom. We will.”
***
“God, Kate. I was so worried Charlie’s parents would be angry with me. We have to find her. I can’t
lose her.”
“We will. Like Tom said, we have to focus. You said you might know the voice, so you’re gonna have
to listen really carefully when we’re at her office. Maybe we’ll get lucky.”
“We have to. If I lose her, my life’s over. She’s everything to me. I just want her back. I just want her
back.” I was a grown man on the verge of crying. I needed to get a grip on myself. Taking in a few deep
breaths, I managed to calm my heart rate. Kate didn’t seem to notice. If she did, she didn’t let on. No
doubt Kate was just as petrified as I was. How she was remaining so calm was beyond my
comprehension. Mind you, with what she’d endured the previous year, it was understandable she knew
not to panic.
Kate parked the car and we went in. She’d called Charlie’s boss ahead of time, so he was expecting
us.
Trace welcomed us into his office and closed the door behind him.
“Any leads on Charlie?” he asked.
Hearing his voice, I knew he wasn’t the one who took her. I took out a small notebook from my pocket
and wrote his name. Making a list of whom it couldn’t be would get me that much closer to whom it was.
“We do have something to go on, but it’s a long shot and we need your help,” I said.
“Anything. Just ask.”
“When I was in my coma, a man visited me threatening to take Charlie and then come after me. I hadn’t
remembered it until Kate’s husband Neil called me to tell me Charlie had gone missing. I’m pretty sure
I’d recognize his voice. It seemed familiar when I heard it at the hospital.”
“Okay, so I’m assuming your plan is to hear everyone that works here?”
“Yes. At least I can eliminate suspects that way. The police won’t be involved for another day because
of their forty-eight hour policy.”
“Is there any way we can get a list of employees?” Kate asked.
“Of course.” Trace punched a few keys on his computer and soon a list was printing on his printer.
“You have full access to everything and everyone.”
“Good, but we’re gonna have to be covert. The last thing we need is for him to know we’re on to him.
He needs to lead us to Charlie.”
“I agree. That’s why I printed the directory, so you’d have a name, picture, and description. Just mull
around and see what happens.”
“Thank you, Trace,” Kate said as he handed the list to her. “We really appreciate your support.”
“Well, we better get to it,” I said.
Kate received a text on her phone. After reading it, she said, “Neil has some men out front to watch in
case someone leaves abruptly.”
“How does he manage to think of everything?” I asked.
“It’s just his way,” she said, attempting to contain her smile. She was so good at not flaunting her
happiness in front of me. I loved her for that.
Kate and I began walking around the office as covertly as possible. After all, the person responsible
knew who I was. One by one, I eliminated nearly every man on the list. Only two were left. Chip
Peterman and Dan Mills. We just needed to track them down. Returning to Trace’s office, I asked about
their whereabouts.
“Dan is on vacation with his family. He’s been gone since last Friday, and Chip should be around here
somewhere. I know I saw him earlier today. I can page him and get him to come in my office. I have a
question about our new server.”
“Great. Can we hide while you talk to him? I don’t wanna spook him. If he’s our guy, I need him to
lead us to Charlie.”
“By all means,” Trace said, motioning to a door in his office. “It’s my bathroom, but you should be
able to hear him with the door ajar.”
Kate and I went in and positioned ourselves. Within minutes, Chip was in Trace’s office, giving him
the 411 about the server. Kate looked at me with her eyebrows raised. I nodded. Chip was the guy. It was
his voice in the hospital. I wanted to kill him.
Kate texted Neil that Chip Peterman was the one. He texted back he would get the address for Chip and
send a team over to his apartment to find Charlie. Kate showed me the screen so I could see what was
happening. I nodded. Now we had to wait. Wait to see if Charlie was at his place or if he’d stashed her
somewhere else. I stood there, wishing Chip would hurry up and finish talking about the server, but he
was explaining everything in great detail to Trace.
Chapter Fifty-Four
CHARLIE
It’d been a long day on the boat all alone. Chip had left food and water for me, but there was still the
issue of going to the bathroom while being tied up. He’d locked the cabin door, but clearly he didn’t trust
me enough to be untied. I’d tried pulling at the door for at least an hour after he left, but it was no use. I
wasn’t strong enough to break the lock.
I kept reviewing the entire situation in my mind, my reality becoming bleaker by the moment. Uncertain
of how Chip would fund our getaway, it didn’t seem like we’d get very far. Suddenly, a conversation a
few months ago with April in accounting flashed through my mind. Money was missing from the company,
but no one had been able to pinpoint who’d taken it. Had it been Chip? I couldn’t do anything helpful
with this knowledge and now I knew we could disappear forever, especially if we lived in a third-world
country. Chip hadn’t exactly given me the itinerary, but I knew he was very smart and had the capacity to
think of everything. At least I had solace in the fact he hadn’t hurt Mitch or my parents to take me. They all
must’ve been so worried about me. Would Mitch be worried? Maybe he didn’t know. He left, so maybe
he wouldn’t want to know.
Placing my hand on my stomach, I wondered what was going to happen when it was time for me to
deliver my little nugget. Not knowing if I’d have access to a doctor, my heart began pounding in my chest.
It all seemed like some sort of nightmare, but it wasn’t. It was real and I was at the mercy of a man who I
had no idea what he was capable of.
Chapter Fifty-Five
MITCH
It seemed like an eternity had passed before we got another text from Neil and we were still stuck in
the bathroom, listening to Chip yammer on. His team had searched Chip’s apartment, but Charlie wasn’t
there. They did, however find an entire wall of pictures of Charlie. Clearly this guy had been stalking her
for a long time—we just hadn’t known it.
Chip sounded so normal talking to Trace. I couldn’t hear anything in his voice indicating he was
anything other than a computer geek.
Finally, their meeting was over and Trace opened the door to the bathroom.
“Well?” he asked.
“It’s him,” I said, ready to punch the wall.
“Shit. Seriously?”
Kate and I both nodded. “It’s definitely him,” I said.
“How do you want to handle this? Do you want me to call the police?”
“No, Neil has security in the lot, ready to follow Chip, and we’re going out to the car right now. We
don’t have any proof he has Charlie, and Neil already sent men to Chip’s apartment. Charlie isn’t there.”
“Okay, well let me know what I can do to help.”
“For now, as much as I hate to say it, we have to wait until Chip leaves and follow him,” I huffed out. I
so wanted to kill the guy right now.
“I’d imagine you don’t want him to see you, so I’ll show you to the back stairwell. You’ll be able to
leave unnoticed.”
Once we were in the car, I looked over at Kate. “Kate, thank you. If it weren’t for you, I don’t know
what I’d be doing right now. You’ve kept me calm.”
Kate tilted her head and gave me a knowing look. “I’ll always be here for you and Charlie, no matter
what.”
“And we’ll always be there for you.”
“Does that mean—”
“Yes. I’ve been a fool. If she wants me back, I’m hers.”
Kate sighed. “There’s the Mitch I’ve been missing. We’re gonna find her and Chip’s going to prison for
a long time.”
Just then, Chip exited the building. He got into his car and I started Kate’s car, ready to follow him.
Kate had already been instructed by Neil’s men to let them follow directly behind Chip and then we’d
follow them. The tension in my body had me ready to boil over. I needed to find Charlie today. No matter
what.
Chip pulled out of the parking lot, followed by Ruiz and Snyder. Then, we trailed behind. I had met the
security guys before we got into the car. Both men, having been Navy SEALs, made me feel more
confident about Charlie being safe soon. They were trained for rescue missions.
After about twenty minutes, we ended up at the harbor. Chip parked his car and began walking down
toward the boats.
“He must have a boat,” I said to Kate. “I want you to stay in the car. If anything happened to you, Neil
would kill me.”
“Yeah, he’s a little protective. I already texted him our whereabouts. He’s on his way with another
team.”
“Okay, good.”
I got out of the car and shadowed Ruiz and Snyder. They were up ahead, tracking Chip. I felt pretty
confident Chip was leading us straight to Charlie.
Chip boarded a sailboat, and Ruiz put his hand up like a stop sign. I caught up with them and gave them
a confused look.
“We need to do a little surveillance before we go charging in. If she’s not there, we’re fucked,” Ruiz
said, answering the question I didn’t ask.
“Okay, how do we get eyes on Charlie?”
“Snyder is going in the water, circling the boat, and hoping to get her in his sights looking through the
cabin windows. He’ll let us know what he sees.” Ruiz explained this as Snyder changed inside their van.
Before I knew it he was in the water, swimming toward Chip’s boat.
“After he sees her, then what?”
“We’re going in. Hopefully Chip doesn’t have a gun.”
I texted Neil to ask if he’d noticed that a gun was registered to Chip when he did the background check.
Neil said no, but of course that didn’t mean Chip didn’t have an illegal gun.
Snyder came out of the water from a different point than when he went in. “She’s there,” he simply
said.
Both relief and adrenaline surged through my body. In a few minutes, Charlie would be back in my
arms where she belonged.
Ruiz looked at me. “I know you want to go in there and beat the shit out of him, but let us do our job
and take him down. Charlie needs you.”
I reluctantly agreed. I knew I could take Chip, no problem, but I also was emotionally involved and I
could make mistakes they wouldn’t. Plus, once I started hitting him, I wasn’t going to stop.
“Just hang back until you see us bring Peterman up top.”
“Okay,” I exhaled. Both men were on the boat before I could say anything else. My girl would be safe
any second. Ruiz returned up on deck with a confused looking Chip, zip ties securing his hands. Snyder
had carried Charlie up on deck and I raced over to her. He set her down in a chair, and I began
immediately untying her hands.
“Mitch, it’s really you? You’re here,” she cried. “I didn’t think we’d ever see each other again.”
As I untied the ropes around Charlie’s wrists, I asked, “Baby, are you okay? Did he hurt you in any
way?”
“No, I was just scared. Scared I’d never see you again.”
I put my hand on her beautiful face. “I might have been acting stupidly for a while—well, a long while,
but I love you, Charlie. If I don’t have you, I don’t have my heart. You’re my everything. Please forgive
me for leaving you.”
Charlie wrapped her arms around my neck. “I’m the one who should be asking for your forgiveness.”
“Baby, what happened with my brother wasn’t your fault. He never should have done what he did. He
may have started out trying to be there for you, but he was in the wrong.”
“Right now, can we just get out of here? I wanna be anywhere but here. Please?”
“Of course. Let’s get you to the hospital so a doctor can check you and the baby out. Once we know
everything’s fine, we’ll have all the time in the world together. I love you so much, baby.”
“I love you too,” Charlie said, tears streaming down her face.
Charlie kept holding tightly to my neck. I pulled her close to me, practically crushing her, but she didn’t
seem to mind. My anger had dissipated with the thought of her being lost to me forever. I’d never been so
afraid in my life. It was a good thing Ruiz and Snyder were here to take down Chip. Otherwise, I might
have killed him for hurting my girl. I would’ve done anything to protect her. Now I’d do anything to get
our lives back and have the family we always talked about. I had my girl back. All was right in my world.
How could I ever have thought I could live without her?
Chapter Fifty-Six
CHARLIE
I couldn’t believe I’d been rescued from whatever Chip’s plans were. At first, I thought my eyes were
playing tricks on me when a man came up from behind Chip and knocked him down to the ground,
securing his wrists in one swift move. When the other man picked me up, telling me he was bringing me to
Mitch, I thought I had to be dreaming. Or hallucinating. But it was real. Mitch had come to save me…he
still loved me.
I woke up in the hospital a few hours after being rescued. Mitch was sitting next to me holding my hand
and Kate was on the other side of me. My parents were leaning against the wall.
“It was real? I wasn’t dreaming?” I asked, still feeling uncertain.
“Baby, you’re safe. We brought you to the hospital to get checked out and they sedated you so you
could rest,” Mitch said while he brought my hand to his lips to kiss.
The IV attached to my arm was welcome. I knew I hadn’t received the proper nutrition for my little
nugget the last couple of days.
“Is the baby okay? What did the doctor say?” My heart started pounding rapidly as the worry spread
over me.
“Everything’s fine,” Kate assured me. “Mitch is the reason we found you.”
My parents were now standing at the edge of my bed. “We were so worried about you, sweetheart,”
my dad said. “We’re so grateful Mitch and Kate found you.”
My eyes filled with tears as Mitch and Kate simultaneously told me what’d happened. If Chip hadn’t
threatened Mitch, they never would’ve known who had me. I was so grateful.
The doctor came in to discharge me. I couldn’t wait to get home, take a shower, feel back to normal.
“I have an idea, if it’s okay with the two of you,” Kate said.
We both looked at her with anticipation.
“How about you come back to my house and you can have the guest room all to yourselves, have some
alone time.”
Mitch and I looked at each other. Nothing sounded better than alone time with Mitch. I really didn’t
want our first night back together to be at my parents’ house…but I had given up our townhouse when
Mitch went to Texas. It seemed stupid to keep paying rent when no one lived there, and I couldn’t face
living there alone.
Mitch nodded while I told Kate we’d love to. My parents each kissed me on the forehead, told me how
much they loved me, then left. I got dressed and we left the hospital. Other than having my baby, I never
wanted to see the hospital again.
***
As we walked into the guest suite, the surroundings sang to my soul. It would rival any five-star hotel
and somehow Kate had rose petals on the bed, chocolate-covered strawberries on the nightstand, and a
bottle of what I assumed to be sparkling cider chilling next to the bed. The air was filled with jasmine and
I noticed candles flickering in the attached bathroom.
“Kate, how did you manage all of this?” I asked.
“Neil and I have our ways. We also had food delivered from George’s, so you can eat whenever you
want. Neil and I have our own special plans for the evening, so I doubt we’ll be seeing each other until
the morning.”
I hugged my best friend, too choked up to say anything else.
Once we were alone, Mitch took my hands in his. “I’ve missed you so much. I don’t know what I
would’ve done if we hadn’t found you,” he said. He began trailing kisses down my neck and onto my
shoulder.
“I’ve missed you too, Mitch. We’ve been through so much in the last six months. I can’t believe we’re
here right now. Together.”
“I know,” he said, stroking my face with his hands. “Here, sit and I’ll pour us some sparkling cider.”
I sat on the love seat across from the bed. “This is a huge guest room,” I said, looking around.
“This whole house is huge,” Mitch muttered, handing me a glass of cider. He then went to the
nightstand and brought the strawberries over to me, placing the tray on the small table next to the love
seat. Mitch picked up a chocolate-covered strawberry and brought it to my lips. I took a bite, moaning
slightly at the sweet taste. Mitch finished the strawberry. He fed me another the same way. “Are you
starved? Do you wanna eat dinner now or in a little while?”
“I’m good for now. We can eat in an hour or so.”
“Good. I know you’ve been through an ordeal, but…I need you, Charlie.”
“I need you too,” I breathed out.
Mitch pulled me into his arms and held me close. He stroked my hair and whispered over and over
how much he loved me. Having his arms around me was heaven. I was safe with the man I loved in our
private oasis. Nothing could touch us or tarnish this moment.
Mitch looked at me longingly. “Do you think…would it be all right—”
“If we made love?” I said, cutting him off. Normally Mitch was very assertive in this area of our
relationship. But I am pregnant, so maybe he was thinking we couldn’t or I may not want to.
“Yes. Only if you think it’s okay.”
“It’s more than okay, but I have no idea what to expect. But all I want is for you to love me.”
Mitch didn’t need any further encouragement. He guided me toward the bathroom, turned on the water,
and began undressing me.
“Charlie, you’re so beautiful,” he said, his mouth finding mine. He kissed me tenderly at first, but then
he ran his fingers through my hair, deepening his kiss, taking control of my mouth. It was just like it’d been
before, his passion for me evident in every stroke of his tongue.
I began unbuttoning Mitch’s shirt while he continued invading my mouth, his hands finding their way to
my breasts, which were so sensitive given my pregnancy. Once his shirt fell to the floor, I undid his belt
and jeans. He helped in taking those off.
We stepped into the shower and Mitch began washing my body. His hands gliding over me made my
insides clench. My nipples were erect and I was wetter between my legs than the parts of me under the
water. When Mitch finished, I washed his body while his hand found its way to my clit. Rubbing my
bundle, he whispered over and over how much I meant to him and he couldn’t wait to marry me.
I had my turn lathering up his body. Staring at his chest, I glided the soap across his powerful pecs,
down his eight-pack abs, and to his cock that was getting harder by the second. Once my hand grabbed a
hold of him, I began sliding up and down. His eyes were locked on mine intently. We were both more than
ready to get out of the shower now.
Mitch shut off the water, grabbed a towel, and began drying me. I got out of the shower, making my
way to the bed while he dried himself. I attempted a couple of sexy poses, but I honestly didn’t know how
sexy I looked with my belly in the way. This was all new territory as Mitch was seeing my naked pregnant
body for the first time. Climbing into the bed with me, Mitch traced his finger around my belly.
“Have you found out what we’re having?” he asked.
His question overflowed my heart with joy. Accepting this baby as his was so important to me. “No, I
haven’t. I thought being surprised would be fun, but now I just really wanna know.”
Mitch laughed. “We can find out if you want, but right now, all I want is to make love to you. We can
talk all you want tomorrow.”
Before I could respond, my man was kissing me again. I loved how he was a take-charge man. The
hand that’d been circling my belly made its way to sweep my slick juice over my folds and then found its
way to my clit. My heart was racing. I was kind of nervous to have sex even though I knew nothing could
happen to the baby.
“I’m not in any rush,” Mitch whispered as his mouth found my left nipple. Having his tongue circling
over my nipple sent sparks through my body. He always knew just what to do to make my body purr. His
fingers continued their onslaught of stroking my clit as his tongue and teeth ravaged my breast. It didn’t
take long for my wet core to begin pulsing and I began screaming out his name, waves crashing over me,
my body quivering uncontrollably.
I arched my back and moaned as I came down from my high. Mitch breathed in my hair. “I could do
that to you all night. I love all the sounds you make when I do things to you, baby.”
“Me too,” I managed to get out. I was pretty sure that’d been the most powerful orgasm I’d ever had.
“That was amazing. You’re amazing,” I said, turning my body on my side to face him. I lifted my hand to
his handsome face and looked into his soulful eyes. The look on his face said it all. He loved me.
Mitch took my hand in his and kissed it. “Baby, I love you so much,” he said.
“I love you too.”
“Are you still with me? We don’t have to do anything you’re not ready for. Even though you’re sexy as
hell being pregnant,” he said, bending down to kiss my belly.
“I wanna feel your body connected to mine, your skin caressing mine, your hot mouth covering mine.”
“That’s all I needed to hear…”
Chapter Fifty-Seven
MITCH
Having Charlie in my arms was the best feeling in the world and I never wanted to let her go. We slept
with her body pressed against mine the whole night. It was the best night’s sleep I’d had since I could
remember. I couldn’t get back the time we’d lost, or change what had happened, but I could get our lives
back on track. I could spend every moment holding her, listening to her, loving her. She was the best thing
that had ever happened to me and I almost lost her for good. I’d taken her for granted and she was almost
taken from me for it. I was never going to let that happen again. She was worth being loved and cherished
all the time.
Morning had come too quickly, like it always seemed to. Charlie began to wake up and turned to face
me.
“Good morning,” she said.
“Good morning, baby.”
“Did you sleep well?”
“I did,” I said, brushing her hair behind her shoulder.
I tried to stop it, but my brow creased and Charlie’s eyes widened a little.
“Why don’t we get some breakfast and talk on the terrace?” I asked.
“Okay,” Charlie said.
We needed to talk about everything that’d happened between us. Having the elephant in the room
wouldn’t make for a healthy relationship. I wanted all of our feelings on the table.
We made our way to the kitchen and proceeded to find a note from Kate. She’d baked a quiche and left
it in the oven warming for us. Coffee was already brewed and she and Neil were gone for the day.
“That’s our Kate,” Charlie said. “She’s always been our best friend.”
“She always will be. I can’t believe all she and Neil have done to get us back together.”
I took out the quiche, cutting a piece for each of us, while Charlie poured the coffee. We also found
fruit and toasted some sourdough bread. When everything was ready, we headed out to the terrace to have
our breakfast…and talk. I could sense Charlie was nervous. I had to admit I was on edge too.
We settled into the chairs on the terrace and took in the view of the Pacific for a moment. It was so
tranquil, listening to the ocean crashing down below while the sun caressed our faces. We ate our
breakfast, making small talk about the weather and what a beautiful day it was shaping up to be. The strain
was terrible as we had a difficult conversation hanging over us.
Deciding to dive in, I said, “I love you, baby, but I’m still struggling with you and Garrett being
together and the fact the child you’re carrying probably isn’t mine and it should be. I hate that there’s any
doubt and we might have to deal with Garrett if it turns out to be his baby.”
Charlie looked at me, her eyes filled with tears. “I know,” she choked out. “I’m ashamed of myself for
allowing this to happen. I’d give anything to go back in time, but I can’t. I just can’t,” she said as she
began sobbing, her hands covering her face. “You left me. You promised you’d always put me first, but
then you were gone.”
“I know, baby. I wish I could go back in time and not have opened myself up to Heather. I’m so sorry I
hurt you by spending time with her. Will you please forgive me?” I asked, pulling her hands away from
her face. I’d decided I was going to man up and make everything right between us again.
“I’m the one who should be asking for forgiveness, not the other way around. I didn’t lose my memory.
You relied on what you knew…what you remembered. It just hurt so much to be abandoned by you.”
I pulled Charlie from her seat and sat her on my lap. With one of my hands stroking her face, I asked
her again, “Baby, will you forgive me?”
Tears streamed down Charlie’s cheeks. “Yes, I forgive you. Will you forgive me, Mitch?”
I stayed quiet for a moment. Of course I would, but a child coming forth from their union was so much
to take. I was concerned I wouldn’t be able to handle it when the time came even though I wanted to.
“I already forgave you. The minute I heard you were missing, nothing else in this world mattered to me
but finding you…being with you,” I said, bringing her hand to my lips, kissing each finger.
Charlie tilted her head as she looked at me. “I still can’t believe you actually did find me. I can’t
believe you can actually forgive me after what I have done.”
“Believe me, Charlie. I’m still incredibly angry at Garrett, but I know you’d never intentionally hurt
me. We’re gonna be okay.”
Charlie still had concern in her eyes. “Will you be able to accept…?” She placed her hand on her belly
and began gently rubbing. “Our little nugget is very active this morning.”
“Little nugget?” I asked with a raised brow.
“I don’t know what the baby is, so it’s little nugget for now.”
My beautiful girl. Oh I’d missed her so much.
Placing my hand over Charlie’s, I said, “This little nugget is a part of you, so I have no choice but to
love him or her no matter what. I want you and I want our baby.”
“Our baby?”
“Yes, our baby. Everything I have is yours and everything you have is mine. We belong together no
matter what’s happened in the past.”
“So, are you sure you’re ready to be a dad?”
I pulled my girl in for a kiss. “With you? Most definitely.” I watched her face soften as she accepted
we were okay. I felt complete. Whole. Home.
Chapter Fifty-Eight
CHARLIE
September
Relief had spread over me when Mitch made it clear he wanted me and the baby. I’d had so many
nightmares he wouldn’t be able to accept the child I was carrying, but he was more of a man than I gave
him credit for. I counted my blessings every day.
Looking at myself in the mirror, I couldn’t believe it was my wedding day and I’d be Mrs. Mitch
Hawkins within the hour. The last couple of months had been tough. Having Mitch back in my life was
wonderful, and for the most part, we continued to exist just as comfortably and lovingly as we had prior
to his fall. However, at times, I could see the pain behind his eyes. We’d spent the time working on our
relationship, realizing that forgiveness is a process, not an event. Long talks, spending time together, and
getting ready for the baby had done our relationship so much good.
He’d opened up to me about what Heather had done to him in the past, and what his mother had done
as well. Betrayal was something he truly struggled to accept. And, whether intentional or not, I had
betrayed him. I’d always be sorry, but I knew in my heart, I hadn’t betrayed him intentionally. I’d never
been attracted to Garrett physically or in love with him. He’d always been a dear brother and friend to
me. So, I knew I hadn’t overstepped that boundary. Still, Mitch was hurting, and we needed to continue to
work through that. We knew we loved each other, and we knew we were on the right path marrying each
other. Hopefully, time would heal, and we’d only grow closer together. I had relished imagining getting
ready for my wedding day in my own bedroom growing up. Kate and Natalie had been feverishly helping
me to prepare for the wedding. I wanted to be married before the baby came, even though it ultimately
didn’t matter. Mitch and I would be together forever.
“You look so beautiful, Charlie,” Natalie said.
I smiled at my dear friend. “Thank you,” I replied.
“What did you get Mitch as a wedding gift?” Kate asked.
My mouth fell open. “I didn’t get him anything. It completely slipped my mind.”
“Oh, I’m sure he won’t care. All he wants is you,” Kate said.
“I have an idea,” Natalie chimed in. “You’ll just have to give it to him later.”
“Well, I’m up for any ideas, Nat.”
“I think you need to do a paternity test and prove Mitch is the father of your baby,” Natalie said. She
seemed very sure of herself.
“But what if he isn’t?” I whispered. I didn’t dare hope he’d be the baby’s father even though it was a
possibility. I wasn’t sure if I could take it if I just proved Garrett was the father.
“You’re gonna have to have faith on this one, Charlie. I just have a gut feeling Mitch is the father. I
don’t know why, but it’s something I’ve felt from the very beginning. Trust me on this,” Natalie insisted.
“It’s a good idea,” Kate chimed in.
“I know you’re both right. I’ve just been scared to hope for…I mean, so many bad things happened
from his accident that almost tore us apart. I can’t take more bad news.”
“Well, are we all gonna live the rest of our lives not knowing? Wondering? What if there’s a medical
problem and your child needs something genetically from the father? Don’t you want to know? Don’t you
just want confirmation Mitch is the father? I believe in my heart that’s what you’re gonna find out.”
Natalie sure seemed certain. “Wow, Nat. You seem so sure.”
“I am. Mac’s uncle is on the board of directors for the hospital. I talked with him about it and he said
all you needed was a sample from Mitch and a swab from the baby’s cheek. It could be done as soon as
the baby is born. He offered to have it expedited for you in the lab. It normally takes two days, but he’ll
make a call and have it done in a day for us. My gift to you, your gift to Mitch. It’s that simple.”
“Really? That’d be amazing. I wanna know so badly…I just have to get over my fear of not getting the
outcome I want.”
“Great. What room is Mitch staying in? I’ll get a hair sample from his brush.”
“That’s all you need?”
“Yep.”
A knock came at the door. Kate opened the door and was faced with a large bouquet of flowers.
“Come in,” Kate said.
The flowers entered being carried by Lillian. When I saw her, my heart fell out of my body. Her
appearance at my wedding was unfathomable. I never knew anyone who had this kind of nerve. Mitch had
told her she wasn’t welcome. Shockingly, she’d only gotten community service for her participation with
Eric in tampering with Mitch’s drugs.
“Lillian, what are you doing here?” I asked. Natalie made her way past Lillian and out the door before
Lillian could answer. I knew exactly where she was headed. Mitch would be here any minute.
“I came here to tell you what a rude little bitch you are for not inviting me to my own son’s wedding. I
can’t believe you’d be so spiteful. I know it wasn’t Mitch’s idea to cut me out.”
Sitting there with my mouth gaping open, I couldn’t decide what to respond with first. So many
thoughts invaded my mind. All that came out was, “What? You’re unbelievable.”
“Mother, I didn’t want you here, not Charlie. This was my decision,” Mitch said, standing in the
doorway. “I want you to leave now. Sadly, no one wants you here and you only have yourself to thank for
it.”
“Mitch, please. You’re all I have left.”
As she began to plead, fear wrapped around me like a boa constrictor that she could manipulate Mitch.
I began to stand up, but my knees buckled as a sharp pain seared through my abdomen. No, no. Not now.
The baby isn’t due for another month.
Kate rushed to my side as I crumpled to the floor. “Charlie, what is it? The baby?” Her voice was high
pitched.
“I think so,” I cried.
“Neil, Mac, get my mother out of here,” Mitch said as he kneeled down beside me. “Baby, look at me.
I’m here and everything’s gonna be all right. Nat, please call an ambulance.” His words were calming, but
the pain was still intense.
“Kate, go get the minister right now. I wanna have him marry us before we go to the hospital,” I said,
as the pain subsided.
Kate looked at me bewildered, but in best friend form, she made a mad dash out the door.
“Baby, there may not be time for us to get married before—”
“Mitch, get my parents and anyone else you wanna have witness our ceremony. I’m not moving until
we’re married.”
***
Another contraction ripped through me as the ambulance pulled into the hospital. It hurt like hell, but I
kept focusing on the fact I was Mrs. Mitch Hawkins and nothing besides having my little nugget could
make me happier.
The contractions were coming every two minutes and I was doing my best to breathe like Mitch kept
telling me, but it was so hard. The pain was worse than I’d imagined.
I was wheeled into a room with Mitch trailing behind. Once I was moved onto a hospital bed, Mitch
was by my side, holding my hand.
“Any second now, we’re gonna be a mom and a dad,” he said, kissing the back of my hand.
I thought about what Natalie had suggested about the paternity test, but I didn’t know if she could get it
set up to happen right after the baby was born. I knew she’d try her best and that’s all I could hope for.
“One more good push,” the doctor said. “The baby’s right there.”
I inhaled deeply and pushed, crying out the entire time.
Exhaustion overtook me as the baby was delivered. I vaguely heard the doctor say, “It’s a girl.”
“A girl,” Mitch said. “We have a beautiful baby girl. She’s gonna be just like you,” he said, kissing my
hand again, as his eyes teared up.
The nurse was cleaning up the baby while Mitch held me. “You’re so brave, Charlie. If a man had to
do that, well…let’s just say the human race would die out.”
I laughed. My baby was here and I was so happy. I could hear her crying just a few feet away from me.
Our little Katie. Mitch and I had agreed to name her after our best friend.
“We have our Katie,” I said, looking up at Mitch.
“Yeah. We’re gonna have to have another one and name her Natalie. I suppose you’ll want a Neil and a
Mac to round things out.”
“Let’s just get adjusted to having one. We can talk about more babies in a couple of years.”
Mitch’s face dropped a little. I put my hand on his face. “Are you okay?”
“I’m a little overwhelmed to be honest. But, I love my brother even after all he did, and I’ll love his…
our baby no matter what.”
The nurse interrupted us by bringing Katie over. “You have a beautiful, healthy baby. She’s perfect in
every way.” The two of us stayed cocooned in Mitch’s arms for a long time. After a quick shower, we
were moved to a private room that had an envelope waiting on the end table addressed to The Hawkins.
Natalie had worked her magic.
“What’s this?” Mitch said as he picked up the envelope.
“It has information we need to know.” I was both excited and terrified, not knowing what the outcome
was.
“So, you know what’s inside?”
“Yes, but not exactly. Just open it.”
Mitch tore open the envelope and began reading the contents.
“What? How did you? Charlie…”
“Tell me what it says,” I urged him.
“Katie’s mine. I’m her father, not Garrett.” Tears streamed down my Superman’s face. “You know I’d
love her no matter what.”
“Happy Wedding Day,” I said, reaching up to wipe a tear away. Inside, I was thanking God for this gift
I had no words for.
Mitch leaned down and put his forehead to mine. “I can’t believe you did this and so fast.”
“Well, I had a little help from my friends,” I said, seeing Kate and Natalie peering in from the hall.
“Come in, you two,” I called to Kate and Natalie. My dearest friends joined us in our room.
“We actually have Natalie to thank for getting us the paternity results so fast. Mac’s uncle is on the
hospital board, so the minute we arrived the lab was on standby, waiting for a sample from the baby.”
Mitch looked over at Nat. “Thank you, Nat,” he said, pulling her close to him. “This is amazing news,
even though I would’ve been good either way. We decided not to tell Garrett about the pregnancy. My
mom might have tried to, but I’m pretty sure he’s blocked all forms of communication from her just like I
have.”
“I’m so glad it turned out the way it did. But I know your heart is big enough to love any child,”
Natalie said, snuggling into Mitch.
Kate stood there nodding with a knowing smile on her face.
“I know, we just had to have faith,” I said, smiling back at her. I wasn’t sure when she’d become so
wise, but she had just in time to help Mitch and I through our toughest storm.
Before I could ask where Neil and Mac were, they came through the door carrying bags in their hands.
“Someone missed toasting to the happy couple,” Neil said, pulling out both a bottle of champagne and
a bottle of sparkling cider.
“And,” Mac said, unveiling the top of our cake, “you didn’t get to have your cake.”
“Oh my gosh, you guys. Thank you so much for bringing this.” Another bag had paper plates, forks, and
cups.
Once everyone had a glass and a plate full of cake, Mitch raised his glass. “To my beautiful bride. You
make me strive to be a better man. It doesn’t matter where we are or what we’re doing; all I need is you
by my side. I know I can get through anything if I have you.” Mitch bent down to kiss me on the lips.
Everyone raised their glasses and drank to that.
Scooping up a piece of cake, Mitch and I fed each other the first bite. It wasn’t exactly the way I had
dreamed it would happen when I was a little girl, but the best part was I had the man of my dreams.
Nothing could compare to that. Life was good. Kate and Natalie had been through their hard times and
now Mitch and I had made it through a rough patch. Being surrounded by my friends, holding my baby,
being Mitch’s wife…my life was complete.
Epilogue
Katie slept in my arms as Mitch and I watched the sun setting from our back patio. We had bought a
cute little three-bedroom, two-bathroom bungalow that fit us perfectly. Everything in my world was at
peace…finally. I had my loving husband and beautiful daughter. Mitch was good, but still struggled with
losing Garrett as a brother. They hadn’t talked since Garrett went back to New York, but maybe that was
for the best. It was hard to say. I finally convinced Mitch to see someone for grief counseling because
even though Garrett was alive, their relationship wasn’t. He didn’t want to admit it, but he needed to talk
to someone and it was helping. I had complete faith he’d be able to get past what’d happened and move
on at some point. Mitch was the strongest man I knew.
At first, I thought they could find their way past what’d happened. After all, Mitch had forgiven me for
my part. But then I realized he viewed me as a victim of Garrett, not a willing participant in the betrayal. I
hoped in time Mitch could metaphorically take his hands off Garrett’s throat to see his frailties and
forgive him. That was the goal Mitch was working toward.
Lillian had completed her community service and had moved on to another unsuspecting man. She
wasn’t one to be alone and her manipulation tactics seemed sharper than ever. She tried to interject
herself into our lives after our baby was born, but Mitch told her he’d contact her when he was good and
ready. At first she put up a fuss, but Mitch was like a brick wall she was beating her head against. He
wouldn’t give her an inch. I didn’t blame him because she couldn’t be trusted. She’d proven that to us
over and over. Finally, she took the hint and made herself scarce.
Edward was free of her and had been spending time with Mitch, helping him work through the pain of
what had happened with Garrett. He also had become a doting grandfather, which surprised me a little.
But, being free from Lillian had made him into a new man. I hoped one day he’d be able to trust again and
find a nice woman to share his life with.
Chip had pleaded insanity and was currently staying in a psych facility until he could be evaluated to
stand trial. He’d kept a team of psychologists busy trying to figure him out. It was uncertain when his trial
would take place, but I knew when it did I’d have to testify. All I knew was that I was grateful Mitch
found me in time because I’d have no idea where I’d be if he hadn’t.
The year had been a difficult one. Being forgotten and tossed aside by Mitch had nearly decimated my
heart. But, our love had been tested and had come out the other side much stronger than before. For that I
was thankful. Life may not always be predictable, but with my loving husband beside me, and my
beautiful baby girl, my joy was complete.
The End

Chapter One
Trace
San Diego, CA
Staring out my office window, I pondered the life I was about to embark upon with my soon to be
bride, Angelina. For several months we’d been planning the most important day of our lives: our wedding
day. I had no idea how much went into all of this, but I’m a guy, so I kind of went along with whatever my
bride wanted. It seemed like the most sensible thing for me to do because I hadn’t been planning this day
since I was ten like Angelina. She knew exactly what she wanted for every aspect of the wedding and I
knew I wanted to make her every wish come true. That had been my number-one goal since we became
engaged, and it’d continue to be my goal in the years to come. I wanted to make her as happy as she’d
made me.
“Man, daydreaming again, Trace?” Derrick asked, as he barged into my office. “I thought it was only
customary for the bride to daydream.”
I laughed at my best friend and business partner. “Yeah. Hard to believe I’m going to be a married man
in a couple of days.”
Before Derrick could reply, Angelina came in. “What are you two talking about?” she asked with a sly
grin.
“Getting hitched,” I said, gazing at my beautiful girl. Her long, dark hair cascaded down, touching the
tops of her breasts. She smiled, her big blue eyes lighting up. She was so stunning and all mine. God, how
I love this woman.
“I can’t believe you’re going to make an honest man out of Trace here,” Derrick said, patting me on the
shoulder.
Angelina chuckled, but I caught an intense look between them. A connection. It made me wonder…was
something going on I wasn’t aware of? It was a quick flash, but it didn’t escape me. It wasn’t the first time
I’d had this feeling when being with both of them. Goosebumps appeared on my arms just thinking
something could be going on. We’re all good friends, and she loves me. I’m being stupid. No way would
either of them betray me.
“We both know Trace is the most honest guy around,” she retorted. “He’d never deceive anyone. I just
came in to give you this file then I’m off to finalize wedding details with my mom.”
Angelina leaned down to kiss me after placing the file on my desk. I kissed her back, but something
definitely was different. I just couldn’t put my finger on it. “Okay, babe. Have fun with your mom. I’ll call
you later.”
“Thanks,” she said and strolled out.
I would’ve asked Derrick if he thought something was unusual, but he was watching her walk away,
which didn’t sit well with me at all. Why was he watching my girl walk away? I know it was a great
view, but wasn’t that only reserved for me? What the hell was happening and why did I feel so…
paranoid? Just pre-wedding nerves. Man up!
Derrick and I went over the contracts we’d been working on to acquire Hines Electronics. We were on
the verge of expanding our company, TEK Medical.
Everything seemed fine, but I decided to make a surprise visit to my fiancée later in the evening to
check in and put this prickly feeling to rest. Now was not the time to have any reservations about the
woman I was marrying or doubt my best friend, either.
Maybe I was just overreacting due to the bar against sex right before the wedding. How I agreed to
that, I’d never know, but she insisted it’d make our wedding night all the more special and passionate. I
could kind of see her point, so I’d agreed. Maybe the lack of sex was playing with my mind or maybe my
gut instinct was out of whack from all the wedding planning.
Derrick went back to his office and my mind ran through a scenario I’d recently encountered with the
two of them. I’d watched from the doorway. Angelina had been sitting on Derrick’s desk, her long legs
crossed, laughing with him. They looked cozy, intimate somehow. I’d almost felt as if I’d been intruding
on a private moment between lovers. I waved it off in my mind, thinking they were just close because
Derrick is my best friend. But after today, I really felt something was up. Perhaps I’m overreacting and
it’s something simple like he’s helping her with a wedding gift for me. Maybe jumping to the wrong
conclusions was a side effect of my relationship with my high school girlfriend, Melissa, ending so badly.
The past sure did have a way of rearing its ugly head at the worst times. I hadn’t trusted any woman until
Angelina, or been in any committed relationships. Melissa had done a number on me. I had avoided being
hurt at all cost, so I’d kept things casual. That was until Angelina walked into my life, changing
everything. She was sweet, honest, and compassionate. We’d been together for two years and making her
my wife was something I really wanted. She had my heart and I wanted to be the man that made her happy
the rest of her life. That’s probably why I hated doubting her so much now.
***
It was a little after eight when I turned onto Angelina’s street. Parking farther away than I normally
would gave me a view of all of the cars. Guilt swept over me as I took the keys out of the ignition. If she
caught me, how was I going to explain spying on her? Oh, honey, that’s right. All of a sudden I don’t
trust you. That would go over well. Maybe I was just having cold feet. Jitters. This could all be in my
head and I could just be driving myself crazy for no reason. I’m surely not the first guy to jump to
conclusions before the big day.
Then, I saw it. What the fuck? Derrick’s car. Why is Derrick’s car here? I couldn’t come up with one
good reason why my best man was visiting my fiancée without me at this time of night—why he would be
here without telling me. My heart began pounding hard as I attempted to open the car door. My hands were
shaking, so it took a couple of tries just to get out of the car. I had to calm down. Breathe. Just breathe.
There was probably a really good explanation for him being here, even if I couldn’t come up with
anything right now. My mind was blank. I was risking making a fool of myself, but hopefully it would turn
out to be nothing and we’d all have a pretty good laugh about it.
Approaching her house, I decided not to knock on the door. Suspicion drove me to be a Peeping Tom,
and I went around to the back. I made my way toward the master bedroom. With each approaching step, I
felt more nauseated and a little pissed I’d resorted to sneaking around her house, behaving like a stalker.
This wasn’t me. I’m not the jealous type. Of course, I was hurt in high school when Melissa cheated, but
that was the past and we had been stupid kids. I’d grown up and learned about myself and how to choose
the right woman. How had I ended up being so suspicious? If anything, when we went out, Angelina
would remark on how many women checked me out. I never even noticed. I only had eyes for her.
I wasn’t sure if I was more upset with myself for not trusting them or with them for seeing each other
and keeping it a secret. If they caught me, it could create a shit storm, but even with that in mind, I trudged
on. Angelina would be pissed to think I didn’t trust her. But I was here and now I had to find out so I
could put all of this to rest.
“Yeah, baby, just like that. You…feel…so…good,” she moaned out.
Derrick groaned too, but he didn’t say anything.
Those sounds were all too familiar. Angelina moaning. She was talking to Derrick like she talked to
me while we were having sex, telling him just how she liked it. I wanted to cover my ears, but it was way
too late—the sounds and words had already permeated my mind.
Peering through the shutters, I could see them. Her on top of him naked, sliding up and down, his hands
fondling her breasts.
I wanted to turn away, but I just kept staring at her, at them, in disbelief. What the fuck is happening?
My worst fucking nightmare was coming true. My mind was telling me to run, but my feet weren’t
cooperating. Taking a few steps back, I sat on one of the lawn chairs. How long had this been happening?
How could she do this to me? How could my best friend?
They were the two most important people in my life. Every decision I’d made for the last two years
was based on one of them. I couldn’t think of a day that’d gone by in the last two years that I didn’t talk to
them, or hang out. Oh, God. This couldn’t be happening. My breathing was heavy and my heart was
crushed. The pain. Is this what a heart attack felt like? Maybe it was all a mistake and my mind was
playing tricks on me. I went back to the window. It had to be. I had to be losing it.
Feeling the blood coursing through my body, I wanted to burst in and beat the shit out of Derrick, but I
didn’t. My mom had raised me to count to ten before I reacted to anything and I’d been doing that ever
since I could remember. As I counted, an idea better than beating up Derrick came to mind and I knew just
how I was going to play it out.
Taking out my cell phone, I began recording them. Every sordid detail was being captured as they
unknowingly put on the show of their lives. I was furious this was happening, but I could already feel the
vindication for when I would reveal this footage. Being vengeful wasn’t something I normally resorted to,
and I wasn’t proud of myself, but in this case I was willing to make an exception.
Finally, Angelina was done, screaming out, and Derrick was right behind her, finishing a moment later.
I quietly maneuvered my way out of the backyard and slowly walked to my car, wondering how this could
be real. It couldn’t have actually happened. Looking down at my cell, I saw that I’d recorded them for
almost five minutes. How I’d managed to stand there for that long, I had no idea. It was like I’d had an
out-of-body experience, watching myself instead of being there seeing it first-hand. What the hell? What
the fuck? How long? How fucking long? I’ve loved her…but it’s all been a lie. If she were going to do
this, why my best friend? Why not some random guy I didn’t know and have a business with? A life with?
I had to get out of here. I couldn’t stand one more second.
As I drove away, my phone lit up with Angelina’s face.
Her fake face.
The face I’d fallen in love with.
The face I thought was so beautiful.
The face I’d wanted to wake up to every morning for the rest of my life.
The face that had continually lied to me for I don’t know how long.
I let it go to voicemail and continued on my way home. We didn’t live that far apart from one another—
only fifteen minutes. In fifteen minutes, I’d be downing a scotch before calling her back. I needed it to
steady my nerves. I was going to insist she take the next couple of days off so she could do wedding stuff
and offer her a spa day, just so I could have some distance. It was going to be the longest forty-eight hours
of my life.
Arriving home, everything seemed so empty. We’d planned on living at my place, since it was near the
beach, and renting hers out. I’d already been making space for her, rearranging my life for her. All for
nothing. She turned us into nothing tonight and the images of her betrayal were seared in my mind. How
would I ever get the picture of them together to go away? Hitting the call button on my phone, I could feel
the bile rising in my throat just from the thought of talking with her. Hearing the voice that’d just screamed
out my best friend’s name. She’d shattered my world and she had no idea. How had I chosen another
woman who would cheat? My stomach was doing somersaults as I listened to the phone ringing.
“There’s my handsome groom. I was beginning to wonder why you didn’t answer my call.”
“I didn’t realize my phone was off,” I said. It was the only thing I could think of. I knew I sounded
robotic. I should have practiced what I was going to say. Too late now.
“Are you okay? You sound a little funny.”
“Oh, it’s been a long day. I’m really tired.” And I just saw you fucking my former best friend. That
ought to do it.
“Aww, I wish I was there to make you feel all better.”
“Me too,” I said begrudgingly. No way in hell did I want her here, but I couldn’t say that. “Listen, I
think you should take the next couple days off to lower your stress and have plenty of time to do things
before the wedding. I also thought you might want to work in some time at the spa.”
Angelina sighed. “That sounds perfect. You always know exactly what I need.”
Apparently I didn’t, because if I knew she needed to do my best friend, I would’ve dumped her a long
time ago.
“Well, you know me, I try. It’s my job to make my bride happy.” That last statement made me want to
hurl.
“You’re very good at it, baby,” she said.
This was going to be harder than I thought—acting normal. It took every fiber in my being to remain
calm. But, I was stronger than the emotions that were fighting to take over. I could do this. No, I would do
this no matter what.
“Thanks, babe. I’m really beat. Can we talk tomorrow?”
“Sure, sweetie. You get some rest. I’ll call you tomorrow.”
We said goodnight and I tossed my phone onto the sofa. I wanted to throw it through the wall, but that
wasn’t going to do any good.
I poured myself another drink, drowning myself in the smooth liquid. I really needed to go to the gym
and work out my aggressions. My workouts had been intense lately, as I wanted to be in my best form for
my bride. She loved my six-pack and…who was I kidding? I’d been working at perfecting my body, and
she had sung my praises, but she had another agenda in mind the entire time. I just couldn’t believe any of
this had happened, but all I had to do was access the video on my phone to remind myself of the shit storm
from just an hour ago. How could they do this to me?
Derrick. That bastard. We’d been best friends since college. I knew we liked the same type, but to be
with my fiancée behind my back…Never in my wildest dreams would I have thought he’d betray me like
this. We were business partners, damn it. I needed another scotch just to attempt to understand what he
was thinking. Pouring my third drink, I sat there numbly, replaying interactions between them over and
over, trying to determine how this happened. But who was I kidding? Trying to figure out the motivation of
liars was an insurmountable task. Beating my head against the wall wasn’t going to get me anywhere.
I had no idea how I was going to be civil at work tomorrow. Avoiding Angelina could be done
somewhat easily until the rehearsal dinner, but I had no way of steering clear of Derrick, unless I wasn’t
at work. Being the groom, there were things for me to do, so perhaps I could limit my interaction with him
as well.
Finishing my third drink, I crawled into bed and stared at the ceiling. At least I wasn’t in any shape to
drive because I really wanted to track Derrick down and beat the crap out of him. I wish I knew how this
went down and who’d been the initiator between them. How long had it been going on? Where did they
first—I was torturing myself with questions I most likely wouldn’t get the answers to, and the answers
weren’t going to make me feel better anyway. Even though I’d come up with a way to punish them for
hurting me, I knew that ultimately wasn’t going to help in the long term.
It might have made me a cold-hearted bastard, but I wanted to hurt them as much as they’d hurt me. I
really didn’t care what anyone thought of my actions.
When your heart is broken, it takes its own sweet time to heal. I’d learned that after Melissa ravaged it
in high school. It took me years to trust again. Now, here I was, like nothing had changed. Nothing.
