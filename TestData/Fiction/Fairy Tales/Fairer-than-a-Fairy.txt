Once there lived a King who had no children for many years after
his marriage. At length heaven granted him a daughter of such
remarkable beauty that he could think of no name so appropriate
for her as 'Fairer-than-a-Fairy.'
It never occurred to the good-natured monarch that such a name
was certain to call down the hatred and jealousy of the fairies in a
body on the child, but this was what happened. No sooner had they
heard of this presumptuous name than they resolved to gain
possession of her who bore it, and either to torment her cruelly, or
at least to conceal her from the eyes of all men.
The eldest of their tribe was entrusted to carry out their revenge.
This Fairy was named Lagree; she was so old that she only had one
eye and one tooth left, and even these poor remains she had to keep
all night in a strengthening liquid. She was also so spiteful that she
gladly devoted all her time to carrying out all the mean or
ill-natured tricks of the whole body of fairies.
With her large experience, added to her native spite, she found but
little difficulty in carrying off Fairer-than-a-Fairy. The poor child,
who was only seven years old, nearly died of fear on finding
herself in the power of this hideous creature. However, when after
an hour's journey underground she found herself in a splendid
palace with lovely gardens, she felt a little reassured, and was
further cheered when she discovered that her pet cat and dog had
followed her.
The old Fairy led her to a pretty room which she said should be
hers, at the same time giving her the strictest orders never to let out
the fire which was burning brightly in the grate. She then gave two
glass bottles into the Princess's charge, desiring her to take the
greatest care of them, and having enforced her orders with the most
awful threats in case of disobedience, she vanished, leaving the
little girl at liberty to explore the palace and grounds and a good
deal relieved [127] at having only two apparently easy tasks set her.
Several years passed, during which time the Princess grew
accustomed to her lonely life, obeyed the Fairy's orders, and by
degrees forgot all about the court of the King her father.
119
One day, whilst passing near a fountain in the garden, she noticed
that the sun's rays fell on the water in such a manner as to produce
a brilliant rainbow. She stood still to admire it, when, to her great
surprise, she heard a voice addressing her which seemed to come
from the centre of its rays. The voice was that of a young man, and
its sweetness of tone and the agreeable things it uttered, led one to
infer that its owner must be equally charming; but this had to be a
mere matter of fancy, for no one was visible.
The beautiful Rainbow informed Fairer-than-a-Fairy that he was
young, the son of a powerful king, and that the Fairy, Lagree, who
owed his parents a grudge, had revenged herself by depriving him
of his natural shape for some years; that she had imprisoned him in
the palace, where he had found his confinement hard to bear for
some time, but now, he [128] owned, he no longer sighed for
freedom since he had seen and learned to love Fairer-than-a-Fairy.
He added many other tender speeches to this declaration, and the
Princess, to whom such remarks were a new experience, could not
help feeling pleased and touched by his attentions.
The Prince could only appear or speak under the form of a
Rainbow, and it was therefore necessary that the sun should shine
on water so as to enable the rays to form themselves.
Fairer-than-a-Fairy lost no moment in which she could meet her
lover, and they enjoyed many long and interesting interviews. One
day, however, their conversation became so absorbing and time
passed so quickly that the Princess forgot to attend to the fire, and
it went out. Lagree, on her return, soon found out the neglect, and
seemed only too pleased to have the opportunity of showing her
spite to her lovely prisoner. She ordered Fairer-than-a-Fairy to start
next day at dawn to ask Locrinos for fire with which to relight the
one she had allowed to go out.
Now this Locrinos was a cruel monster who devoured everyone he
came across, and especially enjoyed a chance of catching and
eating any young girls. Our heroine obeyed with great sweetness,
and without having been able to take leave of her lover she set off
to go to Locrinos as to certain death. As she was crossing a wood a
120
bird sang to her to pick up a shining pebble which she would find
in a fountain close by, and to use it when needed. She took the
bird's advice, and in due time arrived at the house of Locrinos.
Luckily she only found his wife at home, who was much struck by
the Princess's youth and beauty and sweet gentle manners, and still
further impressed by the present of the shining pebble.
She readily let Fairer-than-a-Fairy have the fire, and in return for
the stone she gave her another, which, she said, might prove useful
some day. Then she sent her away without doing her any harm.
Lagree was as much surprised as displeased at the happy result of
this expedition, and Fairer-than-a-Fairy waited anxiously for an
opportunity of meeting Prince Rainbow and telling him her
adventures. She found, however, that he had already been told all
about them by a Fairy who protected him, and to whom he was
related.
The dread of fresh dangers to his beloved Princess made him
devise some more convenient way of meeting than by the garden
fountain, and Fairer-than-a-Fairy carried out his plan daily with
entire success. Every morning she placed a large basin full of water
on her [129] window-sill, and as soon as the sun's rays fell on the
water the Rainbow appeared as clearly as it had ever done in the
fountain. By this means they were able to meet without losing sight
of the fire or of the two bottles in which the old Fairy kept her eye
and her tooth at night, and for some time the lovers enjoyed every
hour of sunshine together.
One day Prince Rainbow appeared in the depths of woe. He had
just heard that he was to be banished from this lovely spot, but he
had no idea where he was to go. The poor young couple were in
despair, and only parted with the last ray of sunshine, and in hopes
of meeting next morning. Alas! next day was dark and gloomy,
and it was only late in the afternoon that the sun broke through the
clouds for a few minutes.
Fairer-than-a-Fairy eagerly ran to the window, but in her haste she
upset the basin, and spilt all the water with which she had carefully
filled it overnight. No other water was at hand except that in the
two bottles. It was the only chance of seeing her lover before they
were separated, and she did not hesitate to break the bottle and
pour their contents into the basin, when the Rainbow appeared at
once. Their farewells were full of tenderness; the Prince made the
most ardent and sincere protestations, and promised to neglect
nothing which might help to deliver his dear Fairer-than-a-Fairy
from her captivity, and implored her to consent to their marriage as
soon as they should both be free. The Princess, on her side, vowed
to have no other husband, and declared herself willing to brave
death itself in order to rejoin him.
121
They were not allowed much time for their adieus; the Rainbow
vanished, and the Princess, resolved to run all risks, started off at
once, taking nothing with her but her dog, her cat, a sprig of myrtle,
and the stone which the wife of Locrinos gave her.
When Lagree became aware of her prisoner's flight she was furious,
and set off at full speed in pursuit. She overtook her just as the
poor girl, overcome by fatigue, had lain down to rest in a cave
which the stone had formed itself into to shelter her. The little dog
who was watching her mistress promptly flew at Lagree and bit her
so severely that she stumbled against a corner of the cave and
broke off her only tooth. Before she had recovered from the pain
and rage this caused her, the Princess had time to escape, and was
some way on her road. Fear gave her strength for some time, but at
last she could go no further, and sank down to rest. As she did so,
the sprig of myrtle she carried touched the ground, and
immediately a green and shady bower [130] sprang up round her, in
which she hoped to sleep in peace.
But Lagree had not given up her pursuit, and arrived just as
Fairer-than-a-Fairy had fallen fast asleep. This time she made sure
of catching her victim, but the cat spied her out, and, springing
from one of the boughs of the arbour she flew at Lagree's face and
tore out her only eye, thus delivering the Princess for ever from her
persecutor.
[131]
122
One might have thought that all would now be well, but no sooner
had Lagree been put to flight than our heroine was overwhelmed
with hunger and thirst. She felt as though she should certainly
expire, and it was with some difficulty that she dragged herself as
far as a pretty little green and white house, which stood at no great
distance. Here she was received by a beautiful lady dressed in
green and white to match the house, which apparently belonged to
her, and of which she seemed the only inhabitant.
She greeted the fainting Princess most kindly, gave her an
excellent supper, and after a long night's rest in a delightful bed
told her that after many troubles she should finally attain her
desire.
As the green and white lady took leave of the Princess she gave her
a nut, desiring her only to open it in the most urgent need.
After a long and tiring journey Fairer-than-a-Fairy was once more
received in a house, and by a lady exactly like the one she had
quitted. Here again she received a present with the same
injunctions, but instead of a nut this lady gave her a golden
pomegranate. The mournful Princess had to continue her weary
way, and after many troubles and hardships she again found rest
and shelter in a third house exactly similar to the two others.
These houses belonged to three sisters, all endowed with fairy gifts,
and all so alike in mind and person that they wished their houses
and garments to be equally alike. Their occupation consisted in
helping those in misfortune, and they were as gentle and
benevolent as Lagree had been cruel and spiteful.
The third Fairy comforted the poor traveller, begged her not to lose
heart, and assured her that her troubles should be rewarded. She
accompanied her advice by the gift of a crystal smelling-bottle,
with strict orders only to open it in case of urgent need.
Fairer-than-a-Fairy thanked her warmly, and resumed her way
cheered by pleasant thoughts.
After a time her road led through a wood, full of soft airs and
sweet odours, and before she had gone a hundred yards she saw a
wonderful silver Castle suspended by strong silver chains to four
of the largest trees. It was so perfectly hung that a gentle breeze
rocked it sufficiently to send you pleasantly to sleep.
Fairer-than-a-Fairy felt a strong desire to enter this Castle, but
besides being hung a little above the ground there seemed to be
neither doors nor windows. She had no doubt (though really I
cannot think why) that the moment had come in which to use the
nut which had [132] been given her. She opened it, and out came a
diminutive hall porter at whose belt hung a tiny chain, at the end of
which was a golden key half as long as the smallest pin you ever
saw.
123
The Princess climbed up one of the silver chains, holding in her
hand the little porter who, in spite of his minute size, opened a
secret door with his golden key and let her in. She entered a
magnificent room which appeared to occupy the entire Castle, and
which was lighted by gold and jewelled stars in the ceiling. In the
midst of this room stood a couch, draped with curtains of all the
colours of the rainbow, and suspended by golden cords so that it
swayed with the Castle in a manner which rocked its occupant
delightfully to sleep.
On this elegant couch lay Prince Rainbow, looking more beautiful
than ever, and sunk in profound slumber, in which he had been
held ever since his disappearance.
Fairer-than-a-Fairy, who now saw him for the first time in his real
shape, hardly dared to gaze at him, fearing lest his appearance
might not be in keeping with the voice and language which had
won her heart. At the same time she could not help feeling rather
hurt at the apparent indifference with which she was received.
She related all the dangers and difficulties she had gone through,
and though she repeated the story twenty times in a loud clear
voice, the Prince slept on and took no heed. She then had recourse
to the golden pomegranate, and on opening it found that all the
seeds were as many little violins which flew up in the vaulted roof
and at once began playing melodiously.
The Prince was not completely roused, but he opened his eyes a
little and looked all the handsomer.
Impatient at not being recognised, Fairer-than-a-Fairy now drew
out her third present, and on opening the crystal scent-bottle a little
syren flew out, who silenced the violins and then sang close to the
Prince's ear the story of all his lady love had suffered in her search
for him. She added some gentle reproaches to her tale, but before
she had got far he was wide awake, and transported with joy threw
himself at the Princess's feet. At the same moment the walls of the
room expanded and opened out, revealing a golden throne covered
with jewels. A magnificent Court now began to assemble, and at
the same time several elegant carriages filled with ladies in
magnificent dresses drove up. In the first and most splendid of
these carriages sat Prince Rainbow's mother. She fondly embraced
her son, after which [133] she informed him that his father had been
dead for some years, that the anger of the Fairies was at length
appeased, and that he might return in peace to reign over his
people, who were longing for his presence.
The Court received the new King with joyful acclamations which
would have delighted him at any other time, but all his thoughts
were full of Fairer-than-a-Fairy. He was just about to present her to
his mother and the Court, feeling sure that her charms would win
all hearts, when the three green and white sisters appeared.
124
They declared the secret of Fairer-than-a-Fairy's royal birth, and
the Queen taking the two lovers in her carriage set off with them
for the capital of the kingdom.
Here they were received with tumultuous joy. The wedding was
celebrated without delay, and succeeding years diminished neither
the virtues, beauty, nor the mutual affection of King Rainbow and
his Queen, Fairer-than-a-Fairy.
