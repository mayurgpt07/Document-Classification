Very long ago, as old people have told me, there lived a terrible
monster, who came out of the North, and laid waste whole tracts of
country, devouring both men and beasts; and this monster was so
destructive that it was feared that unless help came no living
creature would be left on the face of the earth. It had a body like an
ox, and legs like a frog, two short fore-legs, and two long ones
behind, and besides that it had a tail like a serpent, ten fathoms in
length. When it moved it jumped like a frog, and with every spring
it covered half a mile of ground. Fortunately its habit was to
remain for several years in the same place, and not to move on till
the whole neighbourhood was eaten up. Nothing could hunt it,
because its whole body was covered with scales, which were
harder than stone or metal; its two great eyes shone by night, and
even by day, like the brightest lamps, and anyone who had the ill
luck to look into those eyes became as it were bewitched, and was
obliged to rush of his own accord into the monster's jaws. In this
way the Dragon was able to feed upon both men and beasts
without the least trouble to itself, as it needed not to move from the
spot where it was lying. All the neighbouring kings had offered
rich rewards to anyone who should be able to destroy the monster,
either by force or enchantment, and many had tried their luck, but
all had miserably failed. Once a great forest in which the Dragon
lay had been set on fire; the forest was burnt down, but the fire did
not do the monster the least harm. However, there was a tradition
amongst the wise men of the country that the Dragon might be
overcome by one who possessed King Solomon's signet-ring, upon
which a secret writing was engraved. This inscription would enable
anyone who was wise enough to interpret it to find out how the
Dragon could be destroyed. Only no one knew where the ring was
hidden, nor was there any sorcerer [10]or learned man to be found
who would be able to explain the inscription.
At last a young man, with a good heart and plenty of courage, set
out to search for the ring. He took his way towards the sun-rising,
because he knew that all the wisdom of old time comes from the
East. After some years he met with a famous Eastern magician,
and asked for his advice in the matter. The magician answered:
'Mortal men have but little wisdom, and can give you no help, but
the birds of the air would be better guides to you if you could learn
their language. I can help you to understand it if you will stay with
me a few days.'
The youth thankfully accepted the magician's offer, and said, 'I
cannot now offer you any reward for your kindness, but should my
undertaking succeed your trouble shall be richly repaid.'
16
Then the magician brewed a powerful potion out of nine sorts of
herbs which he had gathered himself all alone by moonlight, and
he gave the youth nine spoonfuls of it daily for three days, which
made him able to understand the language of birds.
At parting the magician said to him, 'If you ever find Solomon's
ring and get possession of it, then come back to me, that I may
explain the inscription on the ring to you, for there is no one else in
the world who can do this.'
From that time the youth never felt lonely as he walked along; he
always had company, because he understood the language of birds;
and in this way he learned many things which mere human
knowledge could never have taught him. But time went on, and he
heard nothing about the ring. It happened one evening, when he
was hot and tired with walking, and had sat down under a tree in a
forest to eat his supper, that he saw two gaily-plumaged birds, that
were strange to him, sitting at the top of the tree talking to one
another about him. The first bird said:
'I know that wandering fool under the tree there, who has come so
far without finding what he seeks. He is trying to find King
Solomon's lost ring.'
The other bird answered, 'He will have to seek help from the
Witch-maiden, [3] who will doubtless be able to put him on the
right track. If she has not got the ring herself, she knows well
enough who has it.'
'But where is he to find the Witch-maiden?' said the first [11]bird.
'She has no settled dwelling, but is here to-day and gone
to-morrow. He might as well try to catch the wind.'
The other replied, 'I do not know, certainly, where she is at present,
but in three nights from now she will come to the spring to wash
her face, as she does every month when the moon is full, in order
that she may never grow old nor wrinkled, but may always keep
the bloom of youth.'
'Well,' said the first bird, 'the spring is not far from here. Shall we
go and see how it is she does it?'
'Willingly, if you like,' said the other.
The youth immediately resolved to follow the birds to the spring,
only two things made him uneasy: first, lest he might be asleep
when the birds went, and secondly, lest he might lose sight of them,
since he had not wings to carry him along so swiftly. He was too
tired to keep awake all night, yet his anxiety prevented him from
sleeping soundly, and when with the earliest dawn he looked up to
the tree-top, he was glad to see his feathered companions still
asleep with their heads under their wings. He ate his breakfast, and
waited until the birds should start, but they did not leave the place
17
all day. They hopped about from one tree to another looking for
food, all day long until the evening, when they went back to their
old perch to sleep. The next day the same thing happened, but on
the third morning one bird said to the other, 'To-day we must go to
the spring to see the Witch-maiden wash her face.' They remained
on the tree till noon; then they flew away and went towards the
south. The young man's heart beat with anxiety lest he should lose
sight of his guides, but he managed to keep the birds in view until
they again perched upon a tree. The young man ran after them until
he was quite exhausted and out of breath, and after three short rests
the birds at length reached a small open space in the forest, on the
edge of which they placed themselves on the top of a high tree.
When the youth had overtaken them, he saw that there was a clear
spring in the middle of the space. He sat down at the foot of the
tree upon which the birds were perched, and listened attentively to
what they were saying to each other.
'The sun is not down yet,' said the first bird; 'we must wait yet
awhile till the moon rises and the maiden comes to the spring. Do
you think she will see that young man sitting under the tree?'
Nothing is likely to escape her eyes, certainly not a young man,
said the other bird. 'Will the youth have the sense not to let himself
be caught in her toils?'[12]
'We will wait,' said the first bird, 'and see how they get on
together.'
The evening light had quite faded, and the full moon was already
shining down upon the forest, when the young man heard a slight
rustling sound. After a few moments there came out of the forest a
maiden, gliding over the grass so lightly that her feet seemed
scarcely to touch the ground, and stood beside the spring. The
youth could not turn away his eyes from the maiden, for he had
never in his life seen a woman so beautiful. Without seeming to
notice anything, she went to the spring, looked up to the full moon,
then knelt down and bathed her face nine times, then looked up to
the moon again and walked nine times round the well, and as she
walked she sang this song:
'Full-faced moon with light unshaded,Let my beauty ne'er be
faded.Never let my cheek grow pale!While the moon is waning
nightly,May the maiden bloom more brightly,May her freshness
never fail!'
Then she dried her face with her long hair, and was about to go
away, when her eye suddenly fell upon the spot where the young
man was sitting, and she turned towards the tree. The youth rose
and stood waiting. Then the maiden said, 'You ought to have a
heavy punishment because you have presumed to watch my secret
doings in the moonlight. But I will forgive you this time, because
18
you are a stranger and knew no better. But you must tell me truly
who you are and how you came to this place, where no mortal has
ever set foot before.'
The youth answered humbly: 'Forgive me, beautiful maiden, if I
have unintentionally offended you. I chanced to come here after
long wandering, and found a good place to sleep under this tree. At
your coming I did not know what to do, but stayed where I was,
because I thought my silent watching could not offend you.'
The maiden answered kindly, 'Come and spend this night with us.
You will sleep better on a pillow than on damp moss.'
The youth hesitated for a little, but presently he heard the birds
saying from the top of the tree, 'Go where she calls you, but take
care to give no blood, or you will sell your soul.' So the youth went
19
with her, and soon they reached a beautiful garden, where [13]stood
a splendid house, which glittered in the moonlight as if it was all
built out of gold and silver. When the youth entered he found many
splendid chambers, each one finer than the last. Hundreds of tapers
burnt upon golden candlesticks, and shed a light like the brightest
day. At length they reached a chamber where a table was spread
with the most costly dishes. At the table were placed two chairs,
one of silver, the other of gold. The maiden seated herself upon the
golden chair, and offered the silver one to her companion. They
were served by maidens dressed in white, whose feet made no
sound as they moved about, and not a word was spoken during the
meal. Afterwards the youth and the Witch-maiden conversed
pleasantly together, until a woman, dressed in red, came in to
remind them that it was bedtime. The youth was now shown into
another room, containing a silken bed with down cushions, where
he slept delightfully, yet he seemed to hear a voice near his bed
which repeated to him, 'Remember to give no blood!'
The next morning the maiden asked him whether he would not like
to stay with her always in this beautiful place, and as he did not
answer immediately, she continued: 'You see how I always remain
young and beautiful, and I am under no one's orders, but can do
just what I like, so that I have never thought of marrying before.
But from the moment I saw you I took a fancy to you, so if you
agree, we might be married and might live together like princes,
because I have great riches.'
The youth could not but be tempted with the beautiful maiden's
offer, but he remembered how the birds had called her the witch,
and their warning always sounded in his ears. Therefore he
answered cautiously, 'Do not be angry, dear maiden, if I do not
decide immediately on this important matter. Give me a few days
to consider before we come to an understanding.'
'Why not?' answered the maiden. 'Take some weeks to consider if
you like, and take counsel with your own heart.' And to make the
time pass pleasantly, she took the youth over every part of her
beautiful dwelling, and showed him all her splendid treasures. But
these treasures were all produced by enchantment, for the maiden
could make anything she wished appear by the help of King
Solomon's signet ring; only none of these things remained fixed;
they passed away like the wind without leaving a trace behind. But
the youth did not know this; he thought they were all real.[14]
One day the maiden took him into a secret chamber, where a little
gold box was standing on a silver table. Pointing to the box, she
said, 'Here is my greatest treasure, whose like is not to be found in
the whole world. It is a precious gold ring. When you marry me, I
will give you this ring as a marriage gift, and it will make you the
happiest of mortal men. But in order that our love may last for ever,
20
you must give me for the ring three drops of blood from the little
finger of your left hand.'
When the youth heard these words a cold shudder ran over him, for
he remembered that his soul was at stake. He was cunning enough,
however, to conceal his feelings and to make no direct answer, but
he only asked the maiden, as if carelessly, what was remarkable
about the ring?
She answered, 'No mortal is able entirely to understand the power
of this ring, because no one thoroughly understands the secret
signs engraved upon it. But even with my half-knowledge I can
work great wonders. If I put the ring upon the little finger of my
left hand, then I can fly like a bird through the air wherever I wish
to go. If I put it on the third finger of my left hand I am invisible,
and I can see everything that passes around me, though no one can
see me. If I put the ring upon the middle finger of my left hand,
then neither fire nor water nor any sharp weapon can hurt me. If I
put it on the forefinger of my left hand, then I can with its help
produce whatever I wish. I can in a single moment build houses or
anything I desire. Finally, as long as I wear the ring on the thumb
of my left hand, that hand is so strong that it can break down rocks
and walls. Besides these, the ring has other secret signs which, as I
said, no one can understand. No doubt it contains secrets of great
importance. The ring formerly belonged to King Solomon, the
wisest of kings, during whose reign the wisest men lived. But it is
not known whether this ring was ever made by mortal hands: it is
supposed that an angel gave it to the wise King.'
When the youth heard all this he determined to try and get
possession of the ring, though he did not quite believe in all its
wonderful gifts. He wished the maiden would let him have it in his
hand, but he did not quite like to ask her to do so, and after a while
she put it back into the box. A few days after they were again
speaking of the magic ring, and the youth said, 'I do not think it
possible that the ring can have all the power you say it has.'
Then the maiden opened the box and took the ring out, and it[15]
glittered as she held it like the clearest sunbeam. She put it on the
middle finger of her left hand, and told the youth to take a knife
and try as hard as he could to cut her with it, for he would not be
able to hurt her. He was unwilling at first, but the maiden insisted.
Then he tried, at first only in play, and then seriously, to strike her
with the knife, but an invisible wall of iron seemed to be between
them, and the maiden stood before him laughing and unhurt. Then
she put the ring on her third finger, and in an instant she had
vanished from his eyes. Presently she was beside him again
laughing, and holding the ring between her fingers.
'Do let me try,' said the youth, 'whether I can do these wonderful
things.'
The maiden, suspecting no treachery, gave him the magic ring.
21
The youth pretended to have forgotten what to do, and asked what
finger he must put the ring on so that no sharp weapon could hurt
him?
'Oh, the middle finger of your left hand,' the maiden answered,
laughing.
She took the knife and tried to strike the youth, and he even tried to
cut himself with it, but found it impossible. Then he asked the
maiden to show him how to split stones and rocks with the help of
the ring. So she led him into a courtyard where stood a great
boulder-stone. 'Now,' she said, 'put the ring upon the thumb of your
left hand, and you will see how strong that hand has become. The
youth did so, and found to his astonishment that with a single blow
of his fist the stone flew into a thousand pieces. Then the youth
bethought him that he who does not use his luck when he has it is a
fool, and that this was a chance which once lost might never return.
So while they stood laughing at the shattered stone he placed the
ring, as if in play, upon the third finger of his left hand.
'Now,' said the maiden, 'you are invisible to me until you take the
ring off again.'
But the youth had no mind to do that; on the contrary, he went
farther off, then put the ring on the little finger of his left hand, and
soared into the air like a bird.
When the maiden saw him flying away she thought at first that he
was still in play, and cried, 'Come back, friend, for now you see I
have told you the truth.' But the young man never came back.
Then the maiden saw she was deceived, and bitterly repented that
she had ever trusted him with the ring.[16]
The young man never halted in his flight until he reached the
dwelling of the wise magician who had taught him the speech of
birds. The magician was delighted to find that his search had been
successful, and at once set to work to interpret the secret signs
engraved upon the ring, but it took him seven weeks to make them
out clearly. Then he gave the youth the following instructions how
to overcome the Dragon of the North: 'You must have an iron
horse cast, which must have little wheels under each foot. You
must also be armed with a spear two fathoms long, which you will
be able to wield by means of the magic ring upon your left thumb.
The spear must be as thick in the middle as a large tree, and both
its ends must be sharp. In the middle of the spear you must have
two strong chains ten fathoms in length. As soon as the Dragon has
made himself fast to the spear, which you must thrust through his
jaws, you must spring quickly from the iron horse and fasten the
ends of the chains firmly to the ground with iron stakes, so that he
cannot get away from them. After two or three days the monster's
strength will be so far exhausted that you will be able to come near
him. Then you can put Solomon's ring upon your left thumb and
22
give him the finishing stroke, but keep the ring on your third finger
until you have come close to him, so that the monster cannot see
you, else he might strike you dead with his long tail. But when all
is done, take care you do not lose the ring, and that no one takes it
from you by cunning.'
The young man thanked the magician for his directions, and
promised, should they succeed, to reward him. But the magician
answered, 'I have profited so much by the wisdom the ring has
taught me that I desire no other reward.' Then they parted, and the
youth quickly flew home through the air. After remaining in his
own home for some weeks, he heard people say that the terrible
Dragon of the North was not far off, and might shortly be expected
in the country. The King announced publicly that he would give
his daughter in marriage, as well as a large part of his kingdom, to
whosoever should free the country from the monster. The youth
then went to the King and told him that he had good hopes of
subduing the Dragon, if the King would grant him all he desired
for the purpose. The King willingly agreed, and the iron horse, the
great spear, and the chains were all prepared as the youth requested.
When all was ready, it was found that the iron horse was so heavy
that a hundred men could not move it from the spot, so the youth
found there was nothing for it but to move it with his[17] own
strength by means of the magic ring. The Dragon was now so near
that in a couple of springs he would be over the frontier. The youth
now began to consider how he should act, for if he had to push the
iron horse from behind he could not ride upon it as the sorcerer had
said he must. But a raven unexpectedly gave him this advice: 'Ride
upon the horse, and push the spear against the[18] ground, as if you
were pushing off a boat from the land.' The youth did so, and
found that in this way he could easily move forwards. The Dragon
had his monstrous jaws wide open, all ready for his expected prey.
A few paces nearer, and man and horse would have been
swallowed up by them! The youth trembled with horror, and his
23
blood ran cold, yet he did not lose his courage; but, holding the
iron spear upright in his hand, he brought it down with all his
might right through the monster's lower jaw. Then quick as
lightning he sprang from his horse before the Dragon had time to
shut his mouth. A fearful clap like thunder, which could be heard
for miles around, now warned him that the Dragon's jaws had
closed upon the spear. When the youth turned round he saw the
point of the spear sticking up high above the Dragon's upper jaw,
and knew that the other end must be fastened firmly to the ground;
but the Dragon had got his teeth fixed in the iron horse, which was
now useless. The youth now hastened to fasten down the chains to
the ground by means of the enormous iron pegs which he had
provided. The death struggle of the monster lasted three days and
three nights; in his writhing he beat his tail so violently against the
ground, that at ten miles' distance the earth trembled as if with an
earthquake. When he at length lost power to move his tail, the
youth with the help of the ring took up a stone which twenty
ordinary men could not have moved, and beat the Dragon so hard
about the head with it that very soon the monster lay lifeless before
him.
You can fancy how great was the rejoicing when the news was
spread abroad that the terrible monster was dead. His conqueror
was received into the city with as much pomp as if he had been the
mightiest of kings. The old King did not need to urge his daughter
to marry the slayer of the Dragon; he found her already willing to
bestow her hand upon this hero, who had done all alone what
whole armies had tried in vain to do. In a few days a magnificent
wedding was celebrated, at which the rejoicings lasted four whole
weeks, for all the neighbouring kings had met together to thank the
man who had freed the world from their common enemy. But
everyone forgot amid the general joy that they ought to have
buried the Dragon's monstrous body, for it began now to have such
a bad smell that no one could live in the neighbourhood, and
before long the whole air was poisoned, and a pestilence broke out
which destroyed many hundreds of people. In this distress, the
King's son-in-law resolved to seek help once more from the
Eastern[19] magician, to whom he at once travelled through the air
like a bird by the help of the ring. But there is a proverb which says
that ill-gotten gains never prosper, and the Prince found that the
stolen ring brought him ill-luck after all. The Witch-maiden had
never rested night nor day until she had found out where the ring
was. As soon as she had discovered by means of magical arts that
the Prince in the form of a bird was on his way to the Eastern
magician, she changed herself into an eagle and watched in the air
until the bird she was waiting for came in sight, for she knew him
at once by the ring which was hung round his neck by a ribbon.
Then the eagle pounced upon the bird, and the moment she seized
him in her talons she tore the ring from his neck before the man in
bird's shape had time to prevent her. Then the eagle flew down to
24
the earth with her prey, and the two stood face to face once more in
human form.
'Now, villain, you are in my power!' cried the Witch-maiden. 'I
favoured you with my love, and you repaid me with treachery and
theft. You stole my most precious jewel from me, and do you
expect to live happily as the King's son-in-law? Now the tables are
turned; you are in my power, and I will be revenged on you for
your crimes.'
'Forgive me! forgive me!' cried the Prince; 'I know too well how
deeply I have wronged you, and most heartily do I repent it.'
The maiden answered, 'Your prayers and your repentance come
too late, and if I were to spare you everyone would think me a fool.
You have doubly wronged me; first you scorned my love, and then
you stole my ring, and you must bear the punishment.'
With these words she put the ring upon her left thumb, lifted the
young man with one hand, and walked away with him under her
arm. This time she did not take him to a splendid palace, but to a
deep cave in a rock, where there were chains hanging from the
wall. The maiden now chained the young man's hands and feet so
that he could not escape; then she said in an angry voice, 'Here you
shall remain chained up until you die. I will bring you every day
enough food to prevent you dying of hunger, but you need never
hope for freedom any more.' With these words she left him.
The old King and his daughter waited anxiously for many weeks
for the Prince's return, but no news of him arrived. The King's
daughter often dreamed that her husband was going through some
great suffering; she therefore begged her father to summon[20] all
the enchanters and magicians, that they might try to find out where
the Prince was and how he could be set free. But the magicians,
with all their arts, could find out nothing, except that he was still
living and undergoing great suffering; but none could tell where he
was to be found. At last a celebrated magician from Finland was
brought before the King, who had found out that the King's
son-in-law was imprisoned in the East, not by men, but by some
more powerful being. The King now sent messengers to the East to
look for his son-in-law, and they by good luck met with the old
magician who had interpreted the signs on King Solomon's ring,
and thus was possessed of more wisdom than anyone else in the
world. The magician soon found out what he wished to know, and
pointed out the place where the Prince was imprisoned, but said:
'He is kept there by enchantment, and cannot be set free without
my help. I will therefore go with you myself.'
So they all set out, guided by birds, and after some days came to
the cave where the unfortunate Prince had been chained up for
nearly seven years. He recognised the magician immediately, but
the old man did not know him, he had grown so thin. However, he
undid the chains by the help of magic, and took care of the Prince
25
until he recovered and became strong enough to travel. When he
reached home he found that the old King had died that morning, so
that he was now raised to the throne. And now after his long
suffering came prosperity, which lasted to the end of his life; but
he never got back the magic ring, nor has it ever again been seen
by mortal eyes.
Now, if you had been the Prince, would you not rather have stayed
with the pretty witch-maiden?
