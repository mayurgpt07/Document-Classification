A King was once hunting in a great wood, and he hunted the game
so eagerly that none of his courtiers could follow him. When
evening came on he stood still and looked round him, and he saw
that he had quite lost himself. He sought a way out, but could find
none. Then he saw an old woman with a shaking head coming
towards him; but she was a witch.
'Good woman,' he said to her, 'can you not show me the way out of
the wood?'
'Oh, certainly, Sir King,' she replied, 'I can quite well do that, but
on one condition, which if you do not fulfil you will never get out
of the wood, and will die of hunger.'
'What is the condition?' asked the King.
'I have a daughter,' said the old woman, 'who is so beautiful that
she has not her equal in the world, and is well fitted to be your wife;
if you will make her lady-queen I will show you the way out of the
wood.'
The King in his anguish of mind consented, and the old woman led
him to her little house where her daughter was sitting by the fire.
She received the King as if she were expecting him, and he saw
that she was certainly very beautiful; but she did not please him,
and he could not look at her without a secret feeling of horror. As
soon as he had lifted the maiden on to his horse the old woman
showed him the way, and the King reached his palace, where the
wedding was celebrated.
The King had already been married once, and had by his first wife
seven children, six boys and one girl, whom he loved more than
anything in the world. And now, because he was afraid that their
step-mother might not treat them well and might do them harm, he
put them in a lonely castle that stood in the middle of a wood. It
lay so hidden, and the way to it was so hard to find, that he himself
could not have found it out had not[5] a wise-woman given him a
reel of thread which possessed a marvellous property: when he
threw it before him it unwound itself and showed him the way. But
the King went so often to his dear children that the Queen was
offended at his absence. She grew curious, and wanted to know
what he had to do quite alone in the wood. She gave his servants a
great deal of money, and they betrayed the secret to her, and also
told her of the reel which alone could point out the way. She had
no rest now till she had found out where the King guarded the reel,
and then she made some little white shirts, and, as she had learnt
from her witch-mother, sewed an enchantment in each of them.
11
And when the King had ridden off she took the little shirts and
went into the wood, and the reel showed her the way. The children,
who saw someone coming in the distance, thought it was their dear
father coming to them, and sprang to meet him very joyfully. Then
she threw over each one a little shirt, which when it had touched
their bodies changed them into swans, and they flew away over the
forest. The Queen went home quite satisfied, and thought she had
got rid of her step-children; but the girl had not run to meet her
with her brothers, and she knew nothing of her.
The next day the King came to visit his children, but he found no
one but the girl.
'Where are your brothers?' asked the King.
'Alas! dear father,' she answered, 'they have gone away and left me
all alone.' And she told him that looking out of her little window
she had seen her brothers flying over the wood in the shape of
swans, and she showed him the feathers which they had let fall in
the yard, and which she had collected. The King mourned, but he
did not think that the Queen had done the wicked deed, and as he
was afraid the maiden would also be taken from him, he wanted to
take her with him. But she was afraid of the step-mother, and
begged the King to let her stay just one night more in the castle in
the wood. The poor maiden thought, 'My home is no longer here; I
will go and seek my brothers.' And when night came she fled away
into the forest. She ran all through the night and the next day, till
she could go no farther for weariness. Then she saw a little hut,
went in, and found a room with six little beds. She was afraid to lie
down on one, so she crept under one of them, lay on the hard floor,
and was going to spend the night there. But when the sun had set
she heard a noise, and[6] saw six swans flying in at the window.
They stood on the floor and blew at one another, and blew all their
feathers off, and their swan-skin came off like a shirt. Then the
maiden recognised her brothers, and overjoyed she crept out from
under the bed. Her brothers were not less delighted than she to see
their little sister again, but their joy did not last long.
'You cannot stay here,' they said to her. 'This is a den of robbers; if
they were to come here and find you they would kill you.'
'Could you not protect me?' asked the little sister.
'No,' they answered, 'for we can only lay aside our swan skins for a
quarter of an hour every evening. For this time we regain our
human forms, but then we are changed into swans again.'
Then the little sister cried and said, 'Can you not be freed?'
'Oh, no,' they said, 'the conditions are too hard. You must not speak
or laugh for six years, and must make in that time six shirts for us
out of star-flowers. If a single word comes out of your mouth, all
your labour is vain.' And when the brothers had said this the
12
quarter of an hour came to an end, and they flew away out of the
window as swans.
But the maiden had determined to free her brothers even if it
should cost her her life. She left the hut, went into the forest,
climbed a tree, and spent the night there. The next morning she
went out, collected star-flowers, and began to sew. She could
speak to no one, and she had no wish to laugh, so she sat there,
looking only at her work.
When she had lived there some time, it happened that the King of
the country was hunting in the forest, and his hunters came to the
tree on which the maiden sat. They called to her and said 'Who are
you?'
But she gave no answer.
'Come down to us,' they said, 'we will do you no harm.'
But she shook her head silently. As they pressed her further with
questions, she threw them the golden chain from her neck. But
they did not leave off, and she threw them her girdle, and when
this was no use, her garters, and then her dress. The hunts-men
would not leave her alone, but climbed the tree, lifted the maiden
down, and led her to the King. The King asked, 'Who are you?
What are you doing up that tree?'
But she answered nothing.
He asked her in all the languages he knew, but she remained[7] as
dumb as a fish. Because she was so beautiful, however, the King's
heart was touched, and he was seized with a great love for her. He
wrapped her up in his cloak, placed her before him on his horse,
and brought her to his castle. There he had her dressed in rich
clothes, and her beauty shone out as bright as day, but not a word
could be drawn from her. He set her at table by his side, and her
modest ways and behaviour pleased him so much that he said, 'I
13
will marry this maiden and none other in the world,' and after some
days he married her. But the King had a wicked mother who was
displeased with the marriage, and said wicked things of the young
Queen. 'Who knows who this girl is?' she said; 'she cannot speak,
and is not worthy of a king.'
After a year, when the Queen had her first child, the old mother
took it away from her. Then she went to the King and said that the
Queen had killed it. The King would not believe it, and would not
allow any harm to be done her. But she sat quietly sewing at the
shirts and troubling herself about nothing. The next time she had a
child the wicked mother did the same thing, but the King could not
make up his mind to believe her. He said, 'She is too sweet and
good to do such a thing as that. If she were not dumb[8] and could
defend herself, her innocence would be proved.' But when the third
child was taken away, and the Queen was again accused, and could
not utter a word in her own defence, the King was obliged to give
her over to the law, which decreed that she must be burnt to death.
When the day came on which the sentence was to be executed, it
was the last day of the six years in which she must not speak or
laugh, and now she had freed her dear brothers from the power of
the enchantment. The six shirts were done; there was only the left
sleeve wanting to the last.
When she was led to the stake, she laid the shirts on her arm, and
as she stood on the pile and the fire was about to be lighted, she
looked around her and saw six swans flying through the air. Then
she knew that her release was at hand and her heart danced for joy.
The swans fluttered round her, and hovered low so that she could
throw the shirts over them. When they had touched them the
swan-skins fell off, and her brothers stood before her living, well
and beautiful. Only the youngest had a swan's wing instead of his
left arm. They embraced and kissed each other, and the Queen
went to the King, who was standing by in great astonishment, and
began to speak to him, saying, 'Dearest husband, now I can speak
and tell you openly that I am innocent and have been falsely
accused.'
She told him of the old woman's deceit, and how she had taken the
three children away and hidden them. Then they were fetched, to
the great joy of the King, and the wicked mother came to no good
end.
But the King and the Queen with their six brothers lived many
years in happiness and peace.
