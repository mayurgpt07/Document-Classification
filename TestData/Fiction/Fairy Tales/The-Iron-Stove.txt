Once upon a time when wishes came true there was a king's son
who was enchanted by an old witch, so that he was obliged to sit in
a large iron stove in a wood. There he lived for many years, and no
one could free him. At last a king's daughter came into the wood;
she had lost her way, and could not find her father's kingdom again.
She had been wandering round and round for nine days, and she
came at last to the iron case. A voice came from within and asked
her, 'Where do you come from, and where do you want to go?' She
answered, 'I have lost my way to my father's kingdom, and I shall
never get home again.' Then the voice from the iron stove said, 'I
will help you to find your home again, and that in a very short time,
if you will promise to do what I ask you. I am a greater prince than
you are a princess, and I will marry you.' Then she grew frightened,
and thought, 'What can a young lassie do with an iron stove?' But
as she wanted very much to go home to her father, she promised to
do what he wished. He said, 'You must come again, and bring a
knife with you to scrape a hole in the iron.'
Then he gave her someone for a guide, who walked near her and
said nothing, but he brought her in two hours to her house. There
was great joy in the castle when the Princess came back, and the
old King fell on her neck and kissed her. But she was very much
troubled, and said, 'Dear father, listen to what has befallen me! I
should never have come home again out of the great wild wood if I
had not come to an iron stove, to whom I have had to promise that
I will go back to free him and marry him!' The old King was so
frightened that he nearly fainted, for she was his only daughter. So
they consulted together, and determined that the miller's daughter,
who was very beautiful, should take her place. They took her there,
gave her a knife, and said she must scrape at the iron stove. She
scraped for twenty-four hours, but [33] did not make the least
impression. When the day broke, a voice called from the iron stove,
'It seems to me that it is day outside.' Then she answered, 'It seems
so to me; I think I hear my father's mill rattling.'
38
'So you are a miller's daughter! Then go away at once, and tell the
King's daughter to come.'
Then she went away, and told the old King that the thing inside the
iron stove would not have her, but wanted the Princess. The old
King was frightened, and his daughter wept. But they had a
swineherd's daughter who was even more beautiful than the
miller's daughter, and they gave her a piece of gold to go to the
iron stove instead of the Princess. Then she was taken out, and had
to scrape for four-and-twenty hours, but she could make no
impression. As soon as the day broke the voice from the stove
called out, 'It seems to be daylight outside.' Then she answered, 'It
seems so to me too; I think I hear my father blowing his horn.' 'So
you are a swineherd's daughter! Go away at once, and let the
King's daughter come. And say to her that what I foretell shall
come to pass, and if she does not come everything in the kingdom
shall fall into ruin, and not one stone shall be left upon another.'
When the Princess heard this she began to cry, but it was no good;
she had to keep her word. She took leave of her father, put a knife
in her belt, and went to the iron stove in the wood. As soon as she
reached it she began to scrape, and the iron gave way and before
two hours had passed she had made a little hole. Then she peeped
in and saw such a beautiful youth all shining with gold and
precious stones that she fell in love with him on the spot. So she
scraped away harder than ever, and made the hole so large that he
could get out. Then he said, 'You are mine, and I am thine; you are
my bride and have set me free!' He wanted to take her with him to
his kingdom, but she begged him just to let her go once more to
her father; and the Prince let her go, but told her not to say more
than three words to her father, then to come back again. So she
39
went home, but alas! she said more than three words; and
immediately the iron stove vanished and went away over a
mountain of glass and sharp swords. But the Prince was free, and
was no longer shut up in it. Then she said good-bye to her father,
and took a little money with her, and went again into the great
wood to look for the iron stove; but she could not find it. She
sought it for nine days, and then her hunger became so great that
she did not know how she could live any longer. And when it was
evening she climbed a little tree and wished that the [34] night
would not come, because she was afraid of the wild beasts. When
midnight came she saw afar off a little light, and thought, 'Ah! if
only I could reach that!' Then she got down from the tree and went
towards the light. She came to a little old house with a great deal of
grass growing round, and stood in front of a little heap of wood.
She thought, 'Alas! what am I coming to?' and peeped through the
window; but she saw nothing inside except big and little toads, and
a table beautifully spread with roast meats and wine, and all the
dishes and drinking-cups were of silver. Then she took heart and
knocked. Then a fat toad called out:
'Little green toad with leg like crook,Open wide the door, and
lookWho it was the latch that shook.'
And a little toad came forward and let her in. When she entered
they all bid her welcome, and made her sit down. They asked her
how she came there and what she wanted. Then she told everything
that had happened to her, and how, because she had exceeded her
permission only to speak three words, the stove had disappeared
with the Prince; and how she had searched a very long time, and
must wander over mountain and valley till she found him.
Then the old toad said:
'Little green toad whose leg doth twist,Go to the corner of which
you wist,And bring to me the large old kist.'
And the little toad went and brought out a great chest. Then they
gave her food and drink, and led her to a beautifully made bed of
silk and samite, on which she lay down and slept soundly. When
the day dawned she arose, and the old toad gave her three things
out of the huge chest to take with her. She would have need of
them, for she had to cross a high glass mountain, three cutting
swords, and a great lake. When she had passed these she would
find her lover again. So she was given three large needles, a
plough-wheel, and three nuts, which she was to take great care of.
She set out with these things, and when she came to the glass
mountain which was so slippery she stuck the three needles behind
her feet and then in front, and so got over it, and when she was on
the other side put them carefully away.
Then she reached the three cutting swords, and got on her
plough-wheel [35] and rolled over them. At last she came to a great
lake, and, when she had crossed that, arrived at a beautiful castle.
40
She went in and gave herself out as a servant, a poor maid who
would gladly be engaged. But she knew that the Prince whom she
had freed from the iron stove in the great wood was in the castle.
So she was taken on as a kitchenmaid for very small wages. Now
the Prince was about to marry another princess, for he thought she
was dead long ago.
[36]
In the evening, when she had washed up and was ready, she felt in
her pocket and found the three nuts which the old toad had given
her. She cracked one and was going to eat the kernel, when behold!
there was a beautiful royal dress inside it! When the bride heard of
this, she came and begged for the dress, and wanted to buy it,
saying that it was not a dress for a serving-maid. Then she said she
would not sell it unless she was granted one favour—namely, to
sleep by the Prince's door. The bride granted her this, because the
dress was so beautiful and she had so few like it. When it was
evening she said to her bridegroom, 'That stupid maid wants to
sleep by your door.'
'If you are contented, I am,' he said. But she gave him a glass of
wine in which she had poured a sleeping-draught. Then they both
went to his room, but he slept so soundly that she could not wake
him. The maid wept all night long, and said, 'I freed you in the
wild wood out of the iron stove; I have sought you, and have
crossed a glassy mountain, three sharp swords, and a great lake
before I found you, and will you not hear me now?' The servants
outside heard how she cried the whole night, and they told their
master in the morning.
When she had washed up the next evening she bit the second nut,
and there was a still more beautiful dress inside. When the bride
saw it she wanted to buy it also. But the maid did not want money,
and asked that she should sleep again by the Prince's door. The
41
bride, however, gave him a sleeping-draught, and he slept so
soundly that he heard nothing. But the kitchenmaid wept the whole
night long, and said, 'I have freed you in a wood and from an iron
stove; I sought you and have crossed a glassy mountain, three
sharp swords, and a great lake to find you, and now you will not
hear me!' The servants outside heard how she cried the whole night,
and in the morning they told their master. And when she had
washed up on the third night she bit the third nut, and there was a
still more beautiful dress inside that was made of pure gold. When
the bride saw it she wanted to have it, but the maid would only
give it her on condition that she should sleep for the third time by
the Prince's door. But the Prince took care not to drink the
sleeping-draught. When she began to weep and to say, 'Dearest
sweetheart, I freed you in the horrible wild wood, and from an iron
stove,' he jumped up and said, 'You are right. You are mine, and I
am thine.' Though it was still night, he got into a carriage with her,
and they took the false bride's clothes away, so that she [37] could
not follow them. When they came to the great lake they rowed
across, and when they reached the three sharp swords they sat on
the plough-wheel, and on the glassy mountain they stuck the three
needles in. So they arrived at last at the little old house, but when
they stepped inside it turned into a large castle. The toads were all
freed, and were beautiful King's children, running about for joy.
There they were married, and they remained in the castle, which
was much larger than that of the Princess's father's. But because
the old man did not like being left alone, they went and fetched
him. So they had two kingdoms and lived in great wealth.
