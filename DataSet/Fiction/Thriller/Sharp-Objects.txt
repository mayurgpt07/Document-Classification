My	 sweater	 was	 new,
stinging	 red	 and	 ugly.	 It	 was
May	 12	 but	 the	 temperature
had	dipped	to	the	forties,	and
after	 four	 days	 shivering	 in
my	 shirtsleeves,	 I	 grabbed
cover	at	a	tag	sale	rather	than
dig	 through	 my	 boxed-up
winter	 clothes.	 Spring	 in
Chicago.
In	 my	 gunny-coveredcubicle	 I	 sat	 staring	 at	 the
computer	 screen.	 My	 story
for	the	day	was	a	limp	sort	of
evil.	 Four	 kids,	 ages	 two
through	 six,	 were	 found
locked	in	a	room	on	the	South
Side	 with	 a	 couple	 of	 tuna
sandwiches	 and	 a	 quart	 of
milk.	 They’d	 been	 left	 three
days,	 flurrying	 like	 chickens
over	the	food	and	feces	on	the
carpet.	 Their	 mother	 had
wandered	 off	 for	 a	 suck	 on
the	 pipe	 and	 just	 forgotten.Sometimes	 that’s	 what
happens.	 No	 cigarette	 burns,
no	 bone	 snaps.	 Just	 an
irretrievable	slipping.	I’d	seen
the	 mother	 after	 the	 arrest:
twenty-two-year-old	 Tammy
Davis,	 blonde	 and	 fat,	 with
pink	 rouge	 on	 her	 cheeks	 in
two	perfect	circles	the	size	of
shot	 glasses.	 I	 could	 imagine
her	 sitting	 on	 a	 shambled-
down	 sofa,	 her	 lips	 on	 that
metal,	a	sharp	burst	of	smoke.
Then	all	was	fast	floating,	herkids	 way	 behind,	 as	 she	 shot
back	to	junior	high,	when	the
boys	 still	 cared	 and	 she	 was
the	 prettiest,	 a	 glossy-lipped
thirteen-year-old	
who
mouthed	 cinnamon	 sticks
before	she	kissed.
A	 belly.	 A	 smell.
Cigarettes	and	old	coffee.	My
editor,	esteemed,	weary	Frank
Curry,	 rocking	 back	 in	 his
cracked	 Hush	 Puppies.	 His
teeth	 soaked	 in	 brown
tobacco	saliva.“Where	 are	 you	 on	 the
story,	 kiddo?”	 There	 was	 a
silver	 tack	 on	 my	 desk,	 point
up.	He	pushed	it	lightly	under
a	yellow	thumbnail.
“Near	 done.”	 I	 had	 three
inches	of	copy.	I	needed	ten.
“Good.	 Fuck	 her,	 file	 it,
and	come	to	my	office.”
“I	can	come	now.”
“Fuck	 her,	 file	 it,	 then
come	to	my	office.”
“Fine.	 Ten	 minutes.”	 I
wanted	my	thumbtack	back.He	 started	 out	 of	 my
cubicle.	His	tie	swayed	down
near	his	crotch.
“Preaker?”
“Yes,	Curry?”
“Fuck	her.”
Frank	 Curry	 thinks	 I’m	 a
soft	 touch.	 Might	 be	 because
I’m	 a	 woman.	 Might	 be
because	I’m	a	soft	touch.
	
Curry’s	 office	 is	 on	 the
third	 floor.	 I’m	 sure	 he	 gets
panicky-pissed	 every	 time	 helooks	 out	 the	 window	 and
sees	the	trunk	of	a	tree.	Good
editors	 don’t	 see	 bark;	 they
see	 leaves—if	 they	 can	 even
make	out	trees	from	up	on	the
twentieth,	 thirtieth	 floor.	 But
for	 the	 Daily	 Post,	 fourth-
largest	 paper	 in	 Chicago,
relegated	 to	 the	 suburbs,
there’s	room	to	sprawl.	Three
floors	 will	 do,	 spreading
relentlessly	 outward,	 like	 a
spill,	 unnoticed	 among	 the
carpet	 retailers	 and	 lampshops.	 A	 corporate	 developer
produced	 our	 township	 over
three	 well-organized	 years—
1961–64—then	named	it	after
his	 daughter,	 who’d	 suffered
a	 serious	 equestrian	 accident
a	 month	 before	 the	 job	 was
finished.	 Aurora	 Springs,	 he
ordered,	 pausing	 for	 a	 photo
by	 a	 brand-new	 city	 sign.
Then	 he	 took	 his	 family	 and
left.	The	daughter,	now	in	her
fifties	 and	 fine	 except	 for	 an
occasional	 tingling	 in	 herarms,	 lives	 in	 Florida	 and
returns	 every	 few	 years	 to
take	a	photo	by	her	namesake
sign,	just	like	Pop.
I	 wrote	 the	 story	 on	 her
last	visit.	Curry	hated	it,	hates
most	 slice-of-life	 pieces.	 He
got	 smashed	 off	 old
Chambord	 while	 he	 read	 it,
left	 his	 office	 smelling	 like
raspberries.	 Curry	 gets	 drunk
fairly	 quietly,	 but	 often.	 It’s
not	the	reason,	though,	that	he
has	 such	 a	 cozy	 view	 of	 theground.	 That’s	 just	 yawing
bad	luck.
I	 walked	 in	 and	 shut	 the
door	to	his	office,	which	isn’t
how	 I’d	 ever	 imagined	 my
editor’s	 office	 would	 look.	 I
craved	 big	 oak	 panels,	 a
window	 pane	 in	 the	 door—
marked	 Chief—so	 the	 cub
reporters	could	watch	us	rage
over	First	Amendment	rights.
Curry’s	 office	 is	 bland	 and
institutional,	 like	 the	 rest	 of
the	 building.	 You	 coulddebate	 journalism	 or	 get	 a
Pap	smear.	No	one	cared.
“Tell	 me	 about	 Wind
Gap.”	Curry	held	the	tip	of	a
ballpoint	 pen	 at	 his	 grizzled
chin.	 I	 could	 picture	 the	 tiny
prick	 of	 blue	 it	 would	 leave
among	the	stubble.
“It’s	at	the	very	bottom	of
Missouri,	 in	 the	 boot	 heel.
Spitting	
distance	
from
Tennessee	 and	 Arkansas,”	 I
said,	 hustling	 for	 my	 facts.
Curry	 loved	 to	 drill	 reporterson	 any	 topics	 he	 deemed
pertinent—the	 number	 of
murders	in	Chicago	last	year,
the	 demographics	 for	 Cook
County,	 or,	 for	 some	 reason,
the	 story	 of	 my	 hometown,	 a
topic	 I	 preferred	 to	 avoid.
“It’s	been	around	since	before
the	 Civil	 War,”	 I	 continued.
“It’s	 near	 the	 Mississippi,	 so
it	was	a	port	city	at	one	point.
Now	 its	 biggest	 business	 is
hog	 butchering.	 About	 two
thousand	 people	 live	 there.Old	money	and	trash.”
“Which	are	you?”
“I’m	 trash.	 From	 old
money.”	 I	 smiled.	 He
frowned.
“And	 what	 the	 hell	 is
going	on?”
I	 sat	 silent,	 cataloguing
various	 disasters	 that	 might
have	 befallen	 Wind	 Gap.	 It’s
one	 of	 those	 crummy	 towns
prone	 to	 misery:	 A	 bus
collision	 or	 a	 twister.	 An
explosion	 at	 the	 silo	 or	 atoddler	 down	 a	 well.	 I	 was
also	 sulking	 a	 bit.	 I’d	 hoped
—as	I	always	do	when	Curry
calls	 me	 into	 his	 office—that
he	 was	 going	 to	 compliment
me	on	a	recent	piece,	promote
me	to	a	better	beat,	hell,	slide
over	 a	 slip	 of	 paper	 with	 a	 1
percent	raise	scrawled	on	it—
but	 I	 was	 unprepared	 to	 chat
about	 current	 events	 in	 Wind
Gap.
“Your	 mom’s	 still	 there,
right,	Preaker?”“Mom.	 Stepdad.”	 A	 half
sister	 born	 when	 I	 was	 in
college,	 her	 existence	 so
unreal	 to	 me	 I	 often	 forgot
her	 name.	 Amma.	 And	 then
Marian,	 always	 long-gone
Marian.
“Well	 dammit,	 you	 ever
talk	 to	 them?”	 Not	 since
Christmas:	a	chilly,	polite	call
after	 administering	 three
bourbons.	 I’d	 worried	 my
mother	could	smell	it	through
the	phone	lines.“Not	lately.”
“Jesus	 Christ,	 Preaker,
read	 the	 wires	 sometime.	 I
guess	there	was	a	murder	last
August?	
Little	
girl
strangled?”
I	 nodded	 like	 I	 knew.	 I
was	 lying.	 My	 mother	 was
the	only	person	in	Wind	Gap
with	 whom	 I	 had	 even	 a
limited	connection,	and	she’d
said	nothing.	Curious.
“Now	 another	 one’s
missing.	Sounds	like	it	mightbe	a	serial	to	me.	Drive	down
there	and	get	me	the	story.	Go
quick.	 Be	 there	 tomorrow
morning.”
No	 way.	 “We	 got	 horror
stories	here,	Curry.”
“Yeah,	 and	 we	 also	 got
three	 competing	 papers	 with
twice	 the	 staff	 and	 cash.”	 He
ran	 a	 hand	 through	 his	 hair,
which	 fell	 into	 frazzled
spikes.	 “I’m	 sick	 of	 getting
slammed	out	of	news.	This	is
our	 chance	 to	 breaksomething.	Big.”
Curry	 believes	 with	 just
the	 right	 story,	 we’d	 become
the	overnight	paper	of	choice
in	 Chicago,	 gain	 national
credibility.	 Last	 year	 another
paper,	not	us,	sent	a	writer	to
his	 hometown	 somewhere	 in
Texas	 after	 a	 group	 of	 teens
drowned	in	the	spring	floods.
He	wrote	an	elegiac	but	well-
reported	 piece	 on	 the	 nature
of	 water	 and	 regret,	 covered
everything	 from	 the	 boys’basketball	team,	which	lost	its
three	best	players,	to	the	local
funeral	 home,	 which	 was
desperately	 unskilled	 in
cleaning	up	drowned	corpses.
The	story	won	a	Pulitzer.
I	 still	 didn’t	 want	 to	 go.
So	 much	 so,	 apparently,	 that
I’d	wrapped	my	hands	around
the	 arms	 of	 my	 chair,	 as	 if
Curry	 might	 try	 to	 pry	 me
out.	He	sat	and	stared	at	me	a
few	 beats	 with	 his	 watery
hazel	 eyes.	 He	 cleared	 histhroat,	 looked	 at	 his	 photo	 of
his	 wife,	 and	 smiled	 like	 he
was	 a	 doctor	 about	 to	 break
bad	 news.	 Curry	 loved	 to
bark—it	 fit	 his	 old-school
image	 of	 an	 editor—but	 he
was	 also	 one	 of	 the	 most
decent	people	I	knew.
“Look,	kiddo,	if	you	can’t
do	this,	you	can’t	do	it.	But	I
think	 it	 might	 be	 good	 for
you.	 Flush	 some	 stuff	 out.
Get	 you	 back	 on	 your	 feet.
It’s	 a	 damn	 good	 story—weneed	it.	You	need	it.”
Curry	 had	 always	 backed
me.	He	thought	I’d	be	his	best
reporter,	 said	 I	 had	 a
surprising	 mind.	 In	 my	 two
years	 on	 the	 job	 I’d
consistently	 fallen	 short	 of
expectations.	
Sometimes
strikingly.	 Now	 I	 could	 feel
him	 across	 the	 desk,	 urging
me	to	give	him	a	little	faith.	I
nodded	in	what	I	hoped	was	a
confident	fashion.
“I’ll	 go	 pack.”	 My	 handsleft	sweatprints	on	the	chair.
	
I	 had	 no	 pets	 to	 worry
about,	no	plants	to	leave	with
a	neighbor.	Into	a	duffel	bag,
I	tucked	away	enough	clothes
to	last	me	five	days,	my	own
reassurance	 I’d	 be	 out	 of
Wind	Gap	before	week’s	end.
As	 I	 took	 a	 final	 glance
around	 my	 place,	 it	 revealed
itself	 to	 me	 in	 a	 rush.	 The
apartment	 looked	 like	 a
college	
kid’s:	
cheap,transitory,	
and	
mostly
uninspired.	I	promised	myself
I’d	 invest	 in	 a	 decent	 sofa
when	 I	 returned	 as	 a	 reward
for	 the	 stunning	 story	 I	 was
sure	to	dig	up.
On	 the	 table	 by	 the	 door
sat	 a	 photo	 of	 a	 preteen	 me
holding	 Marian	 at	 about	 age
seven.	 We’re	 both	 laughing.
She	has	her	eyes	wide	open	in
surprise,	 I	 have	 mine
scrunched	
shut.	
I’m
squeezing	 her	 into	 me,	 hershort	 skinny	 legs	 dangling
over	 my	 knees.	 I	 can’t
remember	 the	 occasion	 or
what	we	were	laughing	about.
Over	 the	 years	 it’s	 become	 a
pleasant	 mystery.	 I	 think	 I
like	not	knowing.
	
I	take	baths.	Not	showers.
I	 can’t	 handle	 the	 spray,	 it
gets	 my	 skin	 buzzing,	 like
someone’s	 turned	 on	 a
switch.	So	I	wadded	a	flimsy
motel	 towel	 over	 the	 grate	 inthe	 shower	 floor,	 aimed	 the
nozzle	 at	 the	 wall,	 and	 sat	 in
the	three	inches	of	water	that
pooled	 in	 the	 stall.	 Someone
else’s	pubic	hair	floated	by.
I	 got	 out.	 No	 second
towel,	so	I	ran	to	my	bed	and
blotted	myself	with	the	cheap
spongy	blanket.	Then	I	drank
warm	bourbon	and	cursed	the
ice	machine.
Wind	Gap	is	about	eleven
hours	 south	 of	 Chicago.
Curry	had	graciously	allowedme	 a	 budget	 for	 one	 night’s
motel	 stay	 and	 breakfast	 in
the	 morning,	 if	 I	 ate	 at	 a	 gas
station.	 But	 once	 I	 got	 in
town,	 I	 was	 staying	 at	 my
mother’s.	That	he	decided	for
me.	 I	 already	 knew	 the
reaction	 I’d	 get	 when	 I
showed	 up	 at	 her	 door.	 A
quick,	shocked	flustering,	her
hand	 to	 her	 hair,	 a
mismatched	 hug	 that	 would
leave	 me	 aimed	 slightly	 to
one	 side.	 Talk	 of	 the	 messyhouse,	 which	 wouldn’t	 be.	 A
query	 about	 length	 of	 stay
packaged	in	niceties.
“How	 long	 do	 we	 get	 to
have	 you	 for,	 sweetness?”
she’d	 say.	 Which	 meant:
“When	do	you	leave?”
It’s	 the	 politeness	 that	 I
find	most	upsetting.
I	 knew	 I	 should	 prepare
my	notes,	jot	down	questions.
Instead	 I	 drank	 more
bourbon,	 then	 popped	 some
aspirin,	 turned	 off	 the	 light.Lulled	by	the	wet	purr	of	the
air	 conditioner	 and	 the
electric	 plinking	 of	 some
video	 game	 next	 door,	 I	 fell
asleep.	I	was	only	thirty	miles
outside	 my	 hometown,	 but	 I
needed	one	last	night	away.
	
In	 the	 morning	 I	 inhaled
an	 old	 jelly	 doughnut	 and
headed	south,	the	temperature
shooting	 up,	 the	 lush	 forest
imposing	 on	 both	 sides.	 This
part	of	Missouri	is	ominouslyflat—miles	 of	 unmajestic
trees	 broken	 only	 by	 the	 thin
strip	 of	 highway	 I	 was	 on.
The	 same	 scene	 repeating
itself	every	two	minutes.
You	can’t	spot	Wind	Gap
from	 a	 distance;	 its	 tallest
building	 is	 only	 three	 stories.
But	 after	 twenty	 minutes	 of
driving,	 I	 knew	 it	 was
coming:	 First	 a	 gas	 station
popped	 up.	 A	 group	 of
scraggly	teenage	boys	sat	out
front,	 barechested	 and	 bored.Near	 an	 old	 pickup,	 a
diapered	toddler	threw	fistfuls
of	 gravel	 in	 the	 air	 as	 his
mother	filled	up	the	tank.	Her
hair	 was	 dyed	 gold,	 but	 her
brown	 roots	 reached	 almost
to	 her	 ears.	 She	 yelled
something	 to	 the	 boys	 I
couldn’t	 make	 out	 as	 I
passed.	 Soon	 after,	 the	 forest
began	 to	 thin.	 I	 passed	 a
scribble	 of	 a	 strip	 mall	 with
tanning	 beds,	 a	 gun	 shop,	 a
drapery	 store.	 Then	 came	 alonely	 cul-de-sac	 of	 old
houses,	meant	to	be	part	of	a
development	 that	 never
happened.	 And	 finally,	 town
proper.
For	no	good	reason,	I	held
my	breath	as	I	passed	the	sign
welcoming	 me	 to	 Wind	 Gap,
the	 way	 kids	 do	 when	 they
drive	 by	 cemeteries.	 It	 had
been	 eight	 years	 since	 I’d
been	 back,	 but	 the	 scenery
was	visceral.	Head	down	that
road,	and	I’d	find	the	home	ofmy	 grade-school	 piano
teacher,	 a	 former	 nun	 whose
breath	 smelled	 of	 eggs.	 That
path	led	to	a	tiny	park	where	I
smoked	 my	 first	 cigarette	 on
a	 sweaty	 summer	 day.	 Take
that	 boulevard,	 and	 I’d	 be	 on
my	 way	 to	 Woodberry,	 and
the	hospital.
I	decided	to	head	directly
to	 the	 police	 station.	 It
squatted	 at	 one	 end	 of	 Main
Street,	 which	 is,	 true	 to	 its
word,	 Wind	 Gap’s	 mainstreet.	 On	 Main	 Street	 you
will	find	a	beauty	parlor	and	a
hardware	 store,	 a	 five-and-
dime	 called	 Five-and-Dime,
and	 a	 library	 twelve	 shelves
deep.	 You’ll	 find	 a	 clothing
store	called	Candy’s	Casuals,
in	 which	 you	 may	 buy
jumpers,	 turtlenecks,	 and
sweaters	 that	 have	 ducks	 and
schoolhouses	 on	 them.	 Most
nice	women	in	Wind	Gap	are
teachers	 or	 mothers	 or	 work
at	 places	 like	 Candy’sCasuals.	 In	 a	 few	 years	 you
may	 find	 a	 Starbucks,	 which
will	 bring	 the	 town	 what	 it
yearns	 for:	 prepackaged,
preapproved	
mainstream
hipness.	 For	 now,	 though,
there’s	 just	 a	 greasy	 spoon,
which	 is	 run	 by	 a	 family
whose	 name	 I	 can’t
remember.
Main	 Street	 was	 empty.
No	 cars,	 no	 people.	 A	 dog
loped	 down	 the	 sidewalk,
with	no	owner	calling	after	it.All	 the	 lampposts	 were
papered	 with	 yellow	 ribbons
and	 grainy	 photocopies	 of	 a
little	girl.	I	parked	and	peeled
off	 one	 of	 the	 notices,	 taped
crookedly	 to	 a	 stop	 sign	 at	 a
child’s	 height.	 The	 sign	 was
homemade,	
“Missing,”
written	 at	 the	 top	 in	 bold
letters	 that	 may	 have	 been
filled	 in	 by	 Magic	 Marker.
The	 photo	 showed	 a	 dark-
eyed	girl	with	a	feral	grin	and
too	 much	 hair	 for	 her	 head.The	 kind	 of	 girl	 who’d	 be
described	 by	 teachers	 as	 a
“handful.”	I	liked	her.
Natalie	Jane	Keene
Age:	10
Missing	since	5/11
Last	 seen	 at	 Jacob
J.	Garrett	Park,	wearing
blue-jean	 shorts,
red	striped	T-shirt
Tips:	555-7377
I	 hoped	 I’d	 walk	 into	 the
police	 station	 and	 be
informed	 that	 Natalie	 Janewas	 already	 found.	 No	 harm
done.	Seems	she’d	gotten	lost
or	 twisted	 an	 ankle	 in	 the
woods	 or	 ran	 away	 and	 then
thought	 better	 of	 it.	 I	 would
get	 in	 my	 car	 and	 drive	 back
to	 Chicago	 and	 speak	 to	 no
one.
Turns	out	the	streets	were
deserted	 because	 half	 the
town	 was	 out	 searching	 the
forest	 to	 the	 north.	 The
station’s	 receptionist	 told	 me
I	 could	 wait—Chief	 BillVickery	 would	 be	 returning
for	 lunch	 soon.	 The	 waiting
room	 had	 the	 false	 homey
feel	of	a	dentist’s	office;	I	sat
in	 an	 orange	 endchair	 and
flipped	 through	 a	 Redbook.
An	air	freshener	plugged	into
a	 nearby	 outlet	 hissed	 out	 a
plastic	smell	meant	to	remind
me	of	country	breezes.	Thirty
minutes	 later	 I’d	 gone
through	 three	 magazines	 and
was	 starting	 to	 feel	 ill	 from
the	 scent.	 When	 Vickeryfinally	 walked	 in,	 the
receptionist	nodded	at	me	and
whispered	with	eager	disdain,
“Media.”
Vickery,	 a	 slim	 fellow	 in
his	 early	 fifties,	 had	 already
sweated	 through	 his	 uniform.
His	 shirt	 clung	 to	 his	 chest,
and	his	pants	puckered	out	in
back	 where	 an	 ass	 should
have	been.
“Media?”	He	stared	at	me
over	looming	bifocals.	“What
media?”“Chief	 Vickery,	 I’m
Camille	 Preaker,	 with	 the
Daily	Post	in	Chicago.”
“Chicago?	 Why	 are	 you
here	from	Chicago?”
“I’d	 like	 to	 speak	 with
you	 about	 the	 little	 girls—
Natalie	 Keene	 and	 the	 girl
who	was	murdered	last	year.”
“Jesus	 H.	 Christ.	 How’d
you	hear	about	this	up	there?
Jesus	Christ.”
He	 looked	 at	 the
receptionist,	then	back	to	me,as	if	we’d	collaborated.	Then
he	motioned	to	me	to	follow.
“Hold	my	calls,	Ruth.”
The	receptionist	rolled	her
eyes.
Bill	 Vickery	 walked
ahead	 of	 me	 down	 a	 wood-
paneled	hallway	checked	with
cheap	 framed	 photos	 of	 trout
and	 horses,	 then	 into	 his
office,	which	had	no	window,
which	 was	 in	 fact	 a	 tiny
square	 lined	 with	 metal	 files.
He	 sat	 down,	 lit	 a	 cigarette.Didn’t	offer	me	one.
“I	 don’t	 want	 this	 to	 get
out,	Miss.	I	have	no	intention
of	letting	this	get	out.”
“I’m	
afraid,	
Chief
Vickery,	 that	 there’s	 not	 too
much	 choice	 in	 the	 matter.
Children	 are	 being	 targeted.
The	public	should	be	aware.”
It’s	 the	 line	 I’d	 been
mouthing	 on	 the	 drive	 down.
It	directs	fault	to	the	gods.
“What	 do	 you	 care?
They’re	not	your	kids,	they’reWind	Gap	kids.”	He	stood	up,
sat	 back	 down,	 rearranged
some	papers.	“I	bet	I’m	pretty
safe	 to	 say	 Chicago	 never
cared	 about	 Wind	 Gap	 kids
before.”	 His	 voice	 cracked	 at
the	 end.	 Vickery	 sucked	 on
his	 cigarette,	 twisted	 a
chunky	 gold	 pinky	 ring,
blinked	in	quick	succession.	I
wondered	suddenly	if	he	was
going	to	cry.
“You’re	 right.	 Probably
not.	 Look,	 this	 isn’t	 going	 tobe	 some	 sort	 of	 exploitive
story.	 It’s	 important.	 If	 it
makes	 you	 feel	 any	 better,
I’m	 from	 Wind	 Gap.”	 There
you	go,	Curry.	I’m	trying.
He	 looked	 back	 at	 me.
Stared	at	my	face.
“What’s	your	name?”
“Camille	Preaker.”
“How	 do	 I	 not	 know
you?”
“Never	 got	 in	 trouble,
sir.”	I	offered	a	slight	smile.
“Your	family’s	Preaker?”“My	 mother	 married	 out
of	 her	 maiden	 name	 about
twenty-five	 years	 ago.	 Adora
and	Alan	Crellin.”
“Oh.	 Them	 I	 know.”
Them	 everybody	 knew.
Money	 was	 none	 too
common	 in	 Wind	 Gap,	 not
real	 money.	 “But	 I	 still	 don’t
want	you	here,	Miss	Preaker.
You	 do	 this	 story	 and	 from
now	 on,	 people	 will	 only
know	us	for...this.”
“Maybe	 some	 publicitywould	 help,”	 I	 offered.	 “It’s
helped	in	other	cases.”
Vickery	 sat	 quiet	 for	 a
second,	 pondering	 his	 paper-
bag	 lunch	 crumpled	 at	 the
corner	 of	 his	 desk.	 Smelled
like	 bologna.	 He	 murmured
something	 about	 JonBenet
and	shit.
“No	thanks,	Miss	Preaker.
And	 no	 comment.	 I	 have	 no
comment	 on	 any	 ongoing
investigations.	You	can	quote
me.”“Look,	I	have	the	right	to
be	here.	Let’s	make	this	easy.
You	
give	
me	
some
information.	
Something.
Then	I’ll	stay	out	of	your	way
for	 a	 while.	 I	 don’t	 want	 to
make	 your	 job	 any	 harder.
But	I	need	to	do	mine.”	It	was
another	 little	 exchange	 I’d
thought	 up	 somewhere	 near
St.	Louis.
I	 left	 the	 police	 station
with	 a	 photocopied	 map	 of
Wind	 Gap,	 on	 which	 ChiefVickery	 had	 drawn	 a	 tiny	 X
to	 mark	 where	 the	 murdered
girl’s	 body	 was	 discovered
last	year.
Ann	 Nash,	 age	 nine,	 was
found	 on	 August	 27	 in	 Falls
Creek,	 a	 bumpy,	 noisy
waterway	that	ran	through	the
middle	 of	 the	 North	 Woods.
Since	nightfall	on	the	twenty-
sixth,	when	she	went	missing,
a	 search	 party	 had	 combed
the	 forest.	 But	 it	 was	 hunters
who	 came	 across	 her	 justafter	 5	 a.m.	 She’d	 been
strangled	 close	 to	 midnight
with	 a	 basic	 clothesline,
looped	twice	around	her	neck.
Then	 dumped	 in	 the	 creek,
which	was	low	from	the	long
summer	
drought.	
The
clothesline	 had	 snagged	 on	 a
massive	rock,	and	she’d	spent
the	night	drifting	along	in	the
lazy	 stream.	 The	 burial	 was
closed	 coffin.	 This	 was	 all
Vickery	 would	 give	 me.	 It
took	 an	 hour	 of	 questions	 toget	that	much.
From	the	pay	phone	at	the
library	I	dialed	the	number	on
the	 Missing	 poster.	 An
elderly	
female	
voice
identified	 it	 as	 the	 Natalie
Keene	 Hotline,	 but	 in	 the
background	 I	 could	 hear	 a
dishwasher	 churning.	 The
woman	 informed	 me	 that	 so
far	 as	 she	 knew,	 the	 search
was	 still	 going	 in	 the	 North
Woods.	Those	who	wanted	to
help	should	report	to	the	mainaccess	 road	 and	 bring	 their
own	
water.	
Record
temperatures	were	expected.
At	 the	 search	 site,	 four
blonde	 girls	 sat	 stiffly	 on	 a
picnic	 towel	 spread	 in	 the
sun.	They	pointed	toward	one
of	 the	 trails	 and	 told	 me	 to
walk	until	I	found	the	group.
“What	 are	 you	 doing
here?”	asked	the	prettiest.	Her
flushed	 face	 had	 the
roundness	 of	 a	 girl	 barely	 in
her	 teens	 and	 her	 hair	 wasparted	 in	 ribbons,	 but	 her
breasts,	 which	 she	 aimed
proudly	 outward,	 were	 those
of	 a	 grown	 woman.	 A	 lucky
grown	woman.	She	smiled	as
if	 she	 knew	 me,	 impossible
since	 she’d	 have	 been	 a
preschooler	 the	 last	 time	 I
was	in	Wind	Gap.	She	looked
familiar,	 though.	 Maybe	 the
daughter	 of	 one	 of	 my	 old
schoolmates.	 The	 age	 would
be	 right	 if	 someone	 got
knocked	 up	 straight	 out	 ofhigh	school.	Not	unlikely.
“Just	here	to	help,”	I	said.
“Right,”	she	smirked,	and
dismissed	 me	 by	 turning	 all
her	 interest	 to	 picking	 the
polish	off	a	toenail.
I	walked	off	the	crunch	of
the	 hot	 gravel	 and	 into	 the
forest,	 which	 only	 felt
warmer.	 The	 air	 was	 jungle
wet.	 Goldenrod	 and	 wild
sumac	 bushes	 brushed	 my
ankles,	 and	 fuzzy	 white
cottonwood	 seeds	 floatedeverywhere,	 slipping	 into	 my
mouth,	 sticking	 to	 my	 arms.
When	 I	 was	 a	 kid	 we	 called
them	 fairy	 dresses,	 I
remembered	suddenly.
In	 the	 distance	 people
were	 calling	 for	 Natalie,	 the
three	 syllables	 rising	 and
falling	like	song.	Another	ten
minutes	 of	 hard	 hiking	 and	 I
spotted	 them:	 about	 four
dozen	people	walking	in	long
rows,	 sifting	 the	 brush	 in
front	of	them	with	sticks.“Hello!	 Any	 news?”
called	 out	 a	 beer-bellied	 man
closest	 to	 me.	 I	 left	 the	 trail
and	threaded	my	way	through
the	trees	until	I	reached	him.
“Can	 I	 help	 out	 at	 all?”	 I
wasn’t	 quite	 ready	 to	 whip
out	my	notebook.
“You	can	walk	beside	me
here,”	 he	 said.	 “We	 can
always	 use	 another	 person.
Less	 ground	 to	 cover.”	 We
walked	 silently	 for	 a	 few
minutes,	
my	
partneroccasionally	 pausing	 to	 clear
his	 throat	 with	 a	 wet,	 rocky
cough.
“Sometimes	 I	 think	 we
should	 just	 burn	 these
woods,”	 he	 said	 abruptly.
“Seems	 like	 nothing	 good
ever	 happens	 in	 them.	 You	 a
friend	of	the	Keenes?”
“I’m	 a	 reporter	 actually.
Chicago	Daily	Post.”
“Mmmm....	 Well	 how
’bout	that.	You	writing	about
all	this?”A	 sudden	 wail	 shot
through	 the	 trees,	 a	 girl’s
scream:	 “Natalie!”	 My	 hands
began	 sweating	 as	 we	 ran
toward	 the	 cry.	 I	 saw	 figures
tumbling	 toward	 us.	 A
teenager	 with	 white-blonde
hair	 pushed	 past	 us	 onto	 the
trail,	 her	 face	 red	 and
bundled.	 She	 was	 stumbling
like	 a	 frantic	 drunk,	 yelling
Natalie’s	name	at	the	sky.	An
older	 man,	 maybe	 her	 father,
caught	 up	 with	 her,	 wrappedher	 in	 his	 arms,	 and	 began
walking	her	out	of	the	forest.
“They	 found	 her?”	 my
friend	called.
A	
collective	
head
shaking.	 “She	 just	 got
spooked,	 I	 think,”	 another
man	 called	 back.	 “Too	 much
for	her.	Girls	shouldn’t	be	out
here	 anyway,	 not	 as	 things
stand.”	 The	 man	 looked
pointedly	 at	 me,	 took	 off	 his
baseball	 cap	 to	 wipe	 his
brow,	 then	 began	 sifting	 thegrass	again.
“Sad	 work,”	 my	 partner
said.	 “Sad	 time.”	 We	 moved
forward	 slowly.	 I	 kicked	 a
rusted	 beer	 can	 out	 of	 my
way.	 Then	 another.	 A	 single
bird	flew	by	at	eye	level,	then
shot	 straight	 up	 to	 the
treetops.	 A	 grasshopper
landed	suddenly	on	my	wrist.
Creepy	magic.
“Would	 you	 mind	 if	 I
asked	 your	 thoughts	 on	 all
this?”	 I	 pulled	 out	 mynotebook,	wagged	it.
“Don’t	 know	 I	 could	 tell
you	much.”
“Just	what	you	think.	Two
girls	in	a	small	town...”
“Well,	 no	 one	 knows
these	 are	 related,	 right?
Unless	you	know	something	I
don’t.	 For	 all	 we	 know,
Natalie	 will	 turn	 up	 safe	 and
sound.	 Hasn’t	 even	 been	 two
days.”
“Are	 there	 any	 theories
about	Ann?”	I	asked.“Some	loony,	some	crazy
man	musta	done	it.	Some	guy
rides	 through	 town,	 forgot	 to
take	 his	 pills,	 voices	 are
talking	 to	 him.	 Something
like	’at.”
“Why	do	you	say	that?”
He	 stopped,	 pulled	 a
package	 of	 chaw	 from	 his
back	 pocket,	 buried	 a	 fat
pinch	 in	 his	 gumline	 and
worked	it	until	he	got	the	first
tiny	 cut	 to	 let	 the	 tobacco	 in.
The	 lining	 of	 my	 mouthbegan	tingling	in	sympathy.
“Why	else	would	you	pull
out	a	dead	little	girl’s	teeth?”
“He	took	her	teeth?”
“All	but	the	back	part	of	a
baby	molar.”
	
After	 another	 hour	 with
no	results	and	not	much	more
information,	I	left	my	partner,
Ronald	 Kamens	 (“write	 my
middle	initial	too,	if	you	will:
J”),	 and	 hiked	 south	 toward
the	 spot	 where	 Ann’s	 bodywas	 found	 last	 year.	 Took
fifteen	 minutes	 before	 the
sound	 of	 Natalie’s	 name
drifted	 away.	 Ten	 more
minutes	and	I	could	hear	Falls
Creek,	the	bright	cry	of	water.
It	 would	 be	 hard	 to	 carry
a	 child	 through	 these	 woods.
Branches	 and	 leaves	 strangle
the	 pathway,	 roots	 bump	 up
from	 the	 ground.	 If	 Ann	 was
a	 true	 girl	 of	 Wind	 Gap,	 a
town	 that	 demands	 utmost
femininity	 in	 its	 fairer	 sex,she’d	have	worn	her	hair	long
down	her	back.	It	would	have
tangled	 itself	 in	 the	 passing
brush.	 I	 kept	 mistaking
spiderwebs	 for	 glimmering
strands	of	hair.
The	 grass	 was	 still
flattened	 along	 the	 point
where	 the	 body	 was
discovered,	raked	through	for
clues.	 There	 were	 a	 few
recent	 cigarette	 butts	 that	 the
idle	 curious	 had	 left	 behind.
Bored	kids	scaring	each	otherwith	 sightings	 of	 a	 madman
trailing	bloody	teeth.
In	the	creek,	there’d	been
a	 row	 of	 stones	 that	 had
snagged	 the	 clothesline
around	 Ann’s	 neck,	 leaving
her	 tethered	 and	 floating	 in
the	
stream	
like	
the
condemned	 for	 half	 a	 night.
Now,	 just	 smooth	 water
rolling	over	sand.	Mr.	Ronald
J.	 Kamens	 had	 been	 proud
when	 he	 told	 me:	 The
townsfolk	 had	 pried	 out	 therocks,	 loaded	 them	 in	 the
back	 of	 a	 pickup,	 and
smashed	 them	 just	 outside
town.	 It	 was	 a	 poignant
gesture	 of	 faith,	 as	 if	 such
destruction	 would	 ward	 off
future	 evil.	 Seems	 it	 didn’t
work.
I	 sat	 down	 at	 the	 edge	 of
the	 creek,	 running	 my	 palms
over	the	rocky	soil.	Picked	up
a	 smooth,	 hot	 stone	 and
pressed	it	against	my	cheek.	I
wondered	 if	 Ann	 had	 evercome	 here	 when	 she	 was
alive.	 Maybe	 the	 new
generation	 of	 Wind	 Gap	 kids
had	 found	 more	 interesting
ways	to	kill	summers.	When	I
was	a	girl,	we	swam	at	a	spot
just	 downstream	 where	 huge
table	 rocks	 made	 shallow
pools.	 Crawdads	 would
skitter	 around	 our	 feet	 and
we’d	 jump	 for	 them,	 scream
if	 we	 actually	 touched	 one.
No	 one	 wore	 swimsuits,	 it
took	 too	 much	 planning.Instead	 you	 just	 rode	 your
bike	 home	 in	 soaked	 shorts
and	 halters,	 shaking	 your
head	like	a	wet	dog.
Occasionally	 older	 boys,
equipped	 with	 shotguns	 and
stolen	 beer,	 would	 tromp
through	on	their	way	to	shoot
flying	 squirrels	 or	 hare.
Bloody	pieces	of	meat	swung
from	 their	 belts.	 Those	 kids,
cocky	 and	 pissed	 and
smelling	
of	
sweat,
aggressively	 oblivious	 of	 ourexistence,	 always	 compelled
me.	 There	 are	 different	 kinds
of	 hunting,	 I	 know	 now.	 The
gentleman	hunter	with	visions
of	 Teddy	 Roosevelt	 and	 big
game,	who	retires	from	a	day
in	 the	 field	 with	 a	 crisp	 gin
and	 tonic,	 is	 not	 the	 hunter	 I
grew	 up	 with.	 The	 boys	 I
knew,	 who	 began	 young,
were	 blood	 hunters.	 They
sought	 that	 fatal	 jerk	 of	 a
shot-spun	 animal,	 fleeing
silky	 as	 water	 one	 second,then	 cracked	 to	 one	 side	 by
their	bullet.
When	 I	 was	 still	 in
grammar	 school,	 maybe
twelve,	 I	 wandered	 into	 a
neighbor	 boy’s	 hunting	 shed,
a	 wood-planked	 shack	 where
the	animals	were	stripped	and
split.	 Ribbons	 of	 moist,	 pink
flesh	 dangled	 from	 strings,
waiting	 to	 be	 dried	 for	 jerky.
The	dirt	floor	was	rusted	with
blood.	 The	 walls	 were
covered	 with	 photographs	 ofnaked	 women.	 Some	 of	 the
girls	
were	
spreading
themselves	wide,	others	were
being	 held	 down	 and
penetrated.	 One	 woman	 was
tied	 up,	 her	 eyes	 glazed,
breasts	 stretched	 and	 veined
like	grapes,	as	a	man	took	her
from	 behind.	 I	 could	 smell
them	all	in	the	thick,	gory	air.
At	 home	 that	 night,	 I
slipped	 a	 finger	 under	 my
panties	 and	 masturbated	 for
the	 first	 time,	 panting	 andsick.	
Chapter	Two
Happy	Hour.	I	gave	up	on
the	 search	 and	 stopped	 off	 at
Footh’s,	 the	 town’s	 low-key
country	 bar,	 before	 dropping
by	 1665	 Grove	 Street,	 home
of	 Betsy	 and	 Robert	 Nash,
parents	 of	 Ashleigh,	 twelve;
Tiffanie,	eleven;	the	deceased
Ann,	 forever	 nine;	 and	 six-
year-old	Bobby	Jr.
Three	 girls	 until,	 at	 last,their	 baby	 boy.	 As	 I	 sipped
my	 bourbon	 and	 cracked
peanuts,	 I	 pondered	 the
growing	 desperation	 the
Nashes	 must	 have	 felt	 each
time	 a	 child	 popped	 out
without	 a	 penis.	 There	 was
the	first,	Ashleigh,	not	a	boy,
but	sweet	and	healthy.	They’d
always	 wanted	 two	 anyway.
Ashleigh	 got	 a	 fancy	 name
with	extravagant	spelling	and
a	 closet	 full	 of	 frosting-cake
dresses.	 They	 crossed	 theirfingers	 and	 tried	 again	 but
still	 got	 Tiffanie.	 Now	 they
were	 nervous,	 the	 welcome
home	 less	 triumphant.	 When
Mrs.	 Nash	 got	 knocked	 up
once	 again,	 her	 husband
bought	 a	 tiny	 baseball	 glove
to	give	the	lump	in	her	belly	a
nudge	 in	 the	 right	 direction.
Imagine	the	righteous	dismay
when	 Ann	 arrived.	 She	 got
slapped	 with	 some	 family
name—didn’t	 even	 get	 the
extra	e	to	ornament	it	a	bit.Thank	 goodness	 for
Bobby.	 Three	 years	 after	 the
disappointing	 Ann—was	 he
an	accident	or	one	last	shot	of
brio?—Bobby	 was	 given	 his
dad’s	 name,	 was	 doted	 on,
and	 the	 little	 girls	 suddenly
realized	 how	 extraneous	 they
were.	Especially	Ann.	No	one
needs	 a	 third	 girl.	 But	 now
she’s	getting	some	attention.
I	took	my	second	bourbon
in	 one	 smooth	 shot,
unclenched	 my	 shoulders,gave	my	cheeks	a	quick	slap,
got	in	my	big	blue	Buick,	and
wished	 for	 a	 third	 drink.	 I’m
not	 one	 of	 those	 reporters
who	 relishes	 picking	 through
people’s	
privacy.	
It’s
probably	 the	 reason	 I’m	 a
second-rate	journalist.	One	of
them,	at	least.
I	 still	 remembered	 the
way	 to	 Grove	 Street.	 It	 was
two	 blocks	 behind	 my	 high
school,	 which	 served	 every
kid	 within	 a	 seventy-mileradius.	 Millard	 Calhoon	 H.S.
was	 founded	 in	 1930,	 Wind
Gap’s	 last	 cough	 of	 effort
before	 sinking	 into	 the
Depression.	It	was	named	for
the	first	mayor	of	Wind	Gap,
a	 Civil	 War	 hero.	 A
Confederate	 Civil	 War	 hero,
but	that	made	no	never	mind,
a	 hero	 nonetheless.	 Mr.
Calhoon	 shot	 it	 out	 with	 a
whole	troop	of	Yankees	in	the
first	 year	 of	 the	 Civil	 War
over	in	Lexington,	and	single-handedly	 saved	 that	 little
Missouri	town.	(Or	so	implies
the	 plaque	 inside	 the	 school
entrance.)	 He	 darted	 across
farmyards	and	zipped	through
picket-fenced	homes,	politely
shooing	 the	 cooing	 ladies
aside	 so	 they	 wouldn’t	 be
damaged	by	the	Yanks.	Go	to
Lexington	 today	 and	 ask	 to
see	Calhoon	House,	a	fine	bit
of	 period	 architecture,	 and
you	 can	 still	 spot	 northern
bullets	 in	 its	 planks.	 Mr.Calhoon’s	 southern	 bullets,
one	 assumes,	 were	 buried
with	the	men	they	killed.
Calhoon	 himself	 died	 in
1929	 as	 he	 closed	 in	 on	 his
centennial	 birthday.	 He	 was
sitting	 at	 a	 gazebo,	 which	 is
now	gone,	in	the	town	square,
which	 has	 been	 paved	 over,
being	 feted	 by	 a	 big	 brass
band,	 when	 suddenly	 he
leaned	into	his	fifty-two-year-
old	wife	and	said,	“It’s	all	too
loud.”	Then	he	had	a	massivecoronary	and	pitched	forward
in	 his	 chair,	 smudging	 his
Civil	 War	 finery	 in	 the	 tea
cakes	that	had	been	decorated
with	 the	 Stars	 and	 Bars	 just
for	him.
I	 have	 a	 special	 fondness
for	 Calhoon.	 Sometimes	 it	 is
all	too	loud.
	
The	 Nashs’	 house	 was
much	 as	 I’d	 expected,	 a
late-’70s	 piece	 of	 generica
like	all	the	houses	on	the	westside	 of	 town.	 One	 of	 those
homely	
ranch	
houses
featuring	 the	 garage	 as	 its
central	point.	As	I	drove	up,	a
messy	 blond	 boy	 was	 sitting
in	 the	 driveway	 in	 a	 Big
Wheel	several	sizes	too	small
for	 him,	 grunting	 with	 the
effort	 to	 pedal	 the	 plastic
bike.	The	wheels	just	spun	in
place	under	his	weight.
“Want	a	push?”	I	said	as	I
got	 out	 of	 the	 car.	 I’m	 not
good	 with	 children	 as	 a	 rule,but	 it	 seemed	 an	 attempt
wouldn’t	 hurt.	 He	 looked	 at
me	 silently	 for	 a	 second,
stuck	 a	 finger	 in	 his	 mouth.
His	tank	top	slipped	up	as	his
round	 belly	 popped	 out	 to
greet	 me.	 Bobby	 Jr.	 looked
stupid	 and	 cowed.	 A	 boy	 for
the	
Nashes,	
but	
a
disappointing	one.
I	 stepped	 toward	 him.	 He
jumped	 off	 the	 Big	 Wheel,
which	 remained	 clamped	 to
him	 for	 a	 few	 steps,	 jammedon	 his	 body	 as	 it	 was,	 then
clattered	off	sideways.
“Daddy!”	 He	 ran	 wailing
toward	 the	 house	 as	 if	 I’d
pinched	him.
By	the	time	I	reached	the
front	 door,	 a	 man	 appeared.
My	eyes	focused	behind	him,
at	 a	 miniature	 fountain
gurgling	 in	 the	 hallway.	 It
had	 three	 tiers	 shaped	 like
shells,	with	a	statue	of	a	little
boy	 perched	 on	 top.	 Even
from	 the	 other	 side	 of	 thescreen	 door,	 the	 water
smelled	old.
“Can	I	help	you?”
“Are	you	Robert	Nash?”
He	looked	suddenly	wary.
It	 was	 probably	 the	 first
question	the	police	had	asked
him	 when	 they	 told	 him	 his
daughter	was	dead.
“I’m	Bob	Nash.”
“I’m	 so	 sorry	 to	 bother
you	 at	 home.	 I’m	 Camille
Preaker.	 I’m	 from	 Wind
Gap.”“Mmhmmm.”
“But	 now	 I’m	 with	 the
Daily	Post	in	Chicago.	We’re
covering	 the	 story....	 We’re
here	 because	 of	 Natalie
Keene,	 and	 your	 daughter’s
murder.”
I	 braced	 for	 yelling,	 door
slams,	 curses,	 a	 punch.	 Bob
Nash	stuffed	both	hands	deep
into	 his	 front	 pockets	 and
leaned	back	on	his	heels.
“We	 can	 talk	 in	 the
bedroom.”He	held	the	door	open	for
me,	 and	 I	 began	 picking	 my
way	through	the	clutter	of	the
living	 room,	 laundry	 baskets
spurting	 over	 with	 rumpled
sheets	and	tiny	T-shirts.	Then
past	 a	 bathroom	 whose
centerpiece	was	an	empty	roll
of	 toilet	 paper	 on	 the	 floor,
and	down	a	hallway	spackled
with	 fading	 photos	 beneath
grimy	 laminate:	 little	 blonde
girls	crowded	dotingly	around
a	 baby	 boy;	 a	 young	 Nashwith	 his	 arm	 stiffly	 circled
around	his	new	bride,	each	of
them	 holding	 the	 edge	 of	 a
cake	knife.	When	I	got	to	the
bedroom—matching	 curtains
and	bedclothes,	a	tidy	dresser
—I	 realized	 why	 Nash	 had
chosen	 the	 spot	 for	 our
interview.	It	was	the	one	area
of	 the	 house	 that	 held	 a
degree	of	civilization,	like	an
outpost	 on	 the	 edge	 of	 a
despairing	jungle.
Nash	 sat	 on	 one	 edge	 ofthe	bed,	I	on	the	other.	There
were	 no	 chairs.	 We	 could
have	 been	 day	 players	 in	 an
amateur	porn	flick.	Except	we
each	 had	 a	 glass	 of	 cherry
Kool-Aid	he’d	fetched	for	us.
Nash	 was	 a	 well-kept	 man:
clipped	 mustache,	 receding
blond	 hair	 held	 down	 with
gel,	 a	 glaring	 green	 polo
tucked	 into	 jeans.	 I	 assumed
he	 was	 the	 one	 who
maintained	 the	 order	 of	 this
room;	 it	 had	 the	 unadornedneatness	 of	 a	 bachelor	 trying
very	hard.
He	needed	no	foreplay	for
the	 interview,	 and	 I	 was
grateful.	 It’s	 like	 sweet-
talking	 your	 date	 when	 you
both	know	you’re	about	to	get
laid.
“Ann’d	 been	 riding	 her
bike	 all	 last	 summer,”	 he
started	 without	 prompting.
“All	 summer	 just	 around	 and
around	 the	 block.	 My	 wife
and	me	wouldn’t	let	her	go	nofurther.	 She	 was	 only	 nine.
We	 are	 very	 protective
parents.	 But	 then	 at	 the	 end,
right	 before	 she	 started
school,	 my	 wife	 said	 fine.
Ann	had	been	whining,	so	my
wife	said	fine,	Ann	could	ride
to	 her	 friend	 Emily’s	 house.
She	 never	 got	 there.	 It	 was
eight	 o’clock	 before	 we
realized.”
“What	time	had	she	left?”
“About	
seven.	
So
somewhere	along	the	way,	inthose	ten	blocks,	they	got	her.
My	 wife	 will	 never	 forgive
herself.	Never.”
“What	do	you	mean,	 they
got	her?”
“Them,	 him,	 whatever.
The	 bastard.	 The	 sick	 baby
killer.	While	my	family	and	I
sleep,	while	you	drive	around
doing	your	reporting,	there	is
a	person	out	there	looking	for
babies	 to	 kill.	 Because	 you
and	 I	 both	 know	 the	 little
Keene	girl	isn’t	just	lost.”He	finished	the	rest	of	his
Kool-Aid	 in	 one	 belt,	 wiped
his	 mouth.	 The	 quotes	 were
good,	 if	 overpolished.	 I	 find
this	 common,	 and	 in	 direct
proportion	 to	 the	 amount	 of
TV	 a	 subject	 watches.	 Not
long	 ago,	 I	 interviewed	 a
woman	 whose	 twenty-two-
year-old	 daughter	 had	 just
been	 murdered	 by	 her
boyfriend,	and	she	gave	me	a
line	 straight	 from	 a	 legal
drama	I	happened	to	catch	thenight	 before:	 I’d	 like	 to	 say
that	I	pity	him,	but	now	I	fear
I’ll	 never	 be	 able	 to	 pity
again.
“So	 Mr.	 Nash,	 you	 have
no	 thoughts	 of	 anyone	 who
might	 have	 wanted	 to	 harm
you	or	your	family	by	hurting
Ann?”
“Miss,	 I	 sell	 chairs,
ergonomic	chairs	for	a	living
—over	the	phone.	I	work	out
of	 an	 office	 over	 in	 Hayti,
with	 two	 other	 fellas.	 I	 don’tmeet	 anyone.	 My	 wife	 does
part-time	 office	 work	 at	 the
grade	 school.	 There’s	 no
drama	 here.	 Someone	 just
decided	to	kill	our	little	girl.”
He	 said	 the	 last	 part
beleaguredly,	as	if	he’d	given
in	to	the	idea.
Bob	 Nash	 walked	 to	 the
sliding	glass	door	off	the	side
of	 the	 bedroom.	 It	 led	 onto	 a
tiny	deck.	He	opened	the	door
but	stayed	inside.	“Might	be	a
homo	 did	 it,”	 he	 said.	 Theword	 choice	 was	 actually	 a
euphemism	in	these	parts.
“Why	do	you	say	that?”
“He	 didn’t	 rape	 her.
Everyone	 says	 that’s	 unusual
in	a	killing	like	this.	I	say	it’s
the	 only	 blessing	 we	 got.	 I’d
rather	 him	 kill	 her	 than	 rape
her.”
“There	 were	 no	 signs	 of
molestation	at	all?”	I	asked	in
a	 murmur	 I	 hoped	 sounded
gentle.
“None.	 And	 no	 bruises,no	 cuts,	 no	 sign	 of	 any	 kind
of...torture.	 Just	 strangled
her.	Pried	her	teeth	out.	And	I
didn’t	 mean	 what	 I	 said
before,	about	her	being	better
killed	 than	 raped.	 That	 was	 a
stupid	 thing	 to	 say.	 But	 you
know	what	I	mean.”
I	said	nothing,	let	my	tape
recorder	 whir	 on,	 capturing
my	 breathing,	 Nash’s	 ice
clinking,	 the	 thunks	 of	 a
volleyball	game	being	played
next	 door	 in	 the	 last	 of	 thedaylight.
“Daddy?”	A	pretty	blonde
girl,	 hair	 in	 a	 ponytail	 down
to	 her	 waist,	 peeked	 through
the	 crack	 of	 the	 bedroom
door.
“Not	now,	honey.”
“I’m	hungry.”
“You	can	fix	something,”
Nash	 said.	 “There’s	 waffles
in	 the	 freezer.	 Make	 sure
Bobby	eats,	too.”
The	 girl	 lingered	 a	 few
seconds	longer	looking	at	thecarpet	 in	 front	 of	 her,	 then
quietly	 shut	 the	 door.	 I
wondered	where	their	mother
was.
“Were	 you	 home	 when
Ann	 left	 the	 house	 that	 last
time?”
He	 cocked	 his	 head
sideways	 at	 me,	 sucked	 his
teeth.	 “No.	 I	 was	 on	 my	 way
home	from	Hayti.	It’s	an	hour
drive.	 I	 didn’t	 hurt	 my
daughter.”
“I	 didn’t	 mean	 that,”	 Ilied.	“I	was	just	wondering	if
you	got	to	see	her	that	night.”
“Saw	 her	 that	 morning,”
he	 said.	 “Don’t	 remember	 if
we	 talked	 or	 not.	 Probably
not.	Four	kids	in	the	morning
can	 be	 a	 little	 much,	 you
know?”
Nash	twirled	his	ice,	now
melted	 into	 one	 solid	 mass.
He	ran	his	fingers	underneath
his	 bristly	 mustache.	 “No
one’s	 been	 any	 help	 so	 far,”
he	 said.	 “Vickery’s	 in	 overhis	 head.	 There’s	 some	 big-
shot	 detective	 assigned	 here
from	Kansas	City.	He’s	a	kid,
smug	 too.	 Marking	 days	 till
he	 can	 get	 out.	 You	 want	 a
picture	 of	 Ann?”	 He	 said
picture	like	pitcher.	So	do	I	if
I	don’t	watch	it.	He	took	from
his	wallet	a	school	photo	of	a
girl	 with	 a	 wide,	 crooked
smile,	her	pale	brown	hair	cut
jaggedly	above	her	chin.
“My	 wife	 wanted	 to	 put
her	 hair	 in	 rollers	 the	 nightbefore	 school	 photos.	 Ann
chopped	 it	 off	 instead.	 She
was	 a	 willful	 thing.	 A
tomboy.	
I’m	
actually
surprised	 she’s	 the	 one	 they
took.	Ashleigh’s	always	been
the	pretty	one,	you	know.	The
one	 people	 look	 at.”	 He
stared	 at	 the	 photo	 one	 more
time.	 “Ann	 must’ve	 given
hell.”
As	 I	 was	 leaving,	 Nash
gave	 me	 the	 address	 of	 the
friend	Ann	was	going	to	visitthe	 night	 she	 was	 grabbed.	 I
drove	 there	 slowly	 over	 a
perfectly	squared	few	blocks.
This	west	side	was	the	newer
section	 of	 town.	 You	 could
tell	 because	 the	 grass	 was	 a
brighter	 green,	 rolled	 out	 in
prepaid	 patches	 just	 thirty
summers	 ago.	 It	 wasn’t	 like
the	 dark,	 stiff,	 prickly	 stuff
that	 grew	 in	 front	 of	 my
mother’s	 house.	 That	 grass
made	 better	 whistles.	 You
could	 split	 a	 blade	 in	 themiddle,	 blow,	 and	 get	 a
tweezy	 sound	 until	 your	 lips
began	to	itch.
It	 would	 have	 taken	 Ann
Nash	 only	 five	 minutes	 to
pedal	 to	 her	 friend’s	 house.
Add	 an	 extra	 ten	 in	 case	 she
decided	 to	 take	 a	 longer
route,	 stretch	 her	 legs	 at	 the
first	chance	to	really	ride	that
summer.	Nine	is	too	old	to	be
stuck	 pedaling	 in	 circles
around	the	same	block.	What
happened	to	the	bike?I	 rolled	 slowly	 past	 the
home	of	Emily	Stone.	As	the
night	 bloomed	 blue,	 I	 could
see	 a	 girl	 run	 past	 a	 bright
window.	I	bet	Emily’s	parents
tell	 their	 friends	 things	 like,
“We	 hug	 her	 a	 little	 harder
every	night	now.”	I	bet	Emily
wonders	 where	 Ann	 was
taken	to	die.
I	 did.	 Yanking	 out
twenty-some	 teeth,	 no	 matter
how	 small,	 no	 matter	 how
lifeless	the	subject,	is	a	toughtask.	It’d	have	to	be	done	in	a
special	place,	somewhere	safe
so	 a	 person	 could	 take	 a	 few
minutes	 to	 breathe	 now	 and
then.
I	 looked	 at	 Ann’s	 photo,
the	 edges	 curling	 in	 as	 if	 to
protect	 her.	 The	 defiant
haircut	 and	 that	 grin
reminded	 me	 of	 Natalie.	 I
liked	 this	 girl,	 too.	 I	 tucked
her	picture	away	in	my	glove
compartment.	Then	I	lifted	up
the	 sleeve	 of	 my	 shirt	 andwrote	 her	 full	 name—Ann
Marie	 Nash—in	 lush	 blue
ballpoint	 on	 the	 inside	 of	 my
arm.
	
I	didn’t	pull	into	anyone’s
driveway	 to	 turn	 around	 as	 I
needed	 to.	 I	 figured	 people
here	 were	 jittery	 enough
without	unknown	cars	trolling
around.	 Instead	 I	 turned	 left
at	 the	 end	 of	 the	 block	 and
took	 the	 long	 way	 to	 my
mother’s	 house.	 I	 debatedwhether	to	phone	her	first	and
decided	 against	 it	 three
blocks	from	home.	It	was	too
late	 to	 call,	 too	 much
misguided	 courtesy.	 Once
you’ve	 crossed	 state	 lines,
you	don’t	phone	to	ask	if	you
can	drop	in.
My	 mother’s	 massive
house	 is	 at	 the	 southernmost
point	 of	 Wind	 Gap,	 the
wealthy	 section,	 if	 you	 can
count	 approximately	 three
square	 blocks	 of	 town	 as	 asection.	 She	 lives	 in—and	 I
once	 did	 too—an	 elaborate
Victorian	 replete	 with	 a
widow’s	 walk,	 a	 wraparound
veranda,	 a	 summer	 porch
jutting	toward	the	back,	and	a
cupola	 arrowing	 out	 of	 the
top.	 It’s	 full	 of	 cubbyholes
and	
nooks,	
curiously
circuitous.	 The	 Victorians,
especially	
southern
Victorians,	 needed	 a	 lot	 of
room	to	stray	away	from	each
other,	 to	 duck	 tuberculosisand	 flu,	 to	 avoid	 rapacious
lust,	to	wall	themselves	away
from	 sticky	 emotions.	 Extra
space	is	always	good.
The	 house	 is	 at	 the	 very
top	 of	 a	 very	 steep	 hill.	 In
first	 gear,	 you	 can	 drive	 up
the	 cracked	 old	 driveway	 to
the	 top,	 where	 a	 carriage
porch	keeps	cars	from	getting
wet.	 Or	 you	 can	 park	 at	 the
bottom	 of	 the	 hill	 and	 walk
the	 sixty-three	 stairs	 to	 the
top,	 clutching	 the	 cigar-thinrail	to	the	left.	When	I	was	a
child,	 I	 always	 walked	 the
stairs	 up,	 ran	 the	 driveway
down.	I	assumed	the	rail	was
on	 the	 left	 side	 going	 up
because	 I’m	 left-handed,	 and
someone	thought	I	might	like
that.	 Odd	 to	 think	 I	 ever
indulged	
in	
such
presumptions.
I	parked	at	the	bottom,	so
as	to	seem	less	intrusive.	Wet
with	 sweat	 by	 the	 time	 I	 hit
the	 top,	 I	 lifted	 up	 my	 hair,waved	 a	 hand	 at	 the	 back	 of
my	 neck,	 flapped	 my	 shirt	 a
few	 times.	 Vulgar	 pit	 stains
on	 my	 French	 blue	 blouse.	 I
smelled,	as	my	mother	would
say,	ripe.
I	rang	the	doorbell,	which
had	been	a	cat-calling	screech
when	I	was	very	young,	now
subdued	 and	 truncated,	 like
the	 bing!	 you	 hear	 on
children’s	 records	 when	 it’s
time	 to	 turn	 the	 page.	 It	 was
9:15,	 just	 late	 enough	 thatthey	might	have	gone	to	bed.
“Who	 is	 it,	 please?”	 My
mother’s	 reedy	 voice	 behind
the	door.
“Hi,	
Momma.	
It’s
Camille.”	 I	 tried	 to	 keep	 my
voice	even.
“Camille.”	 She	 opened
the	 door	 and	 stood	 in	 the
doorway,	
didn’t	
seem
surprised,	 and	 didn’t	 offer	 a
hug	 at	 all,	 not	 even	 the	 limp
one	 I’d	 expected.	 “Is
something	the	matter?”“No,	 Momma,	 not	 at	 all.
I’m	in	town	on	business.”
“Business.	
Business?
Well,	 goodness,	 I’m	 sorry,
sweetheart,	come	in,	come	in.
The	house	is	not	up	to	par	for
a	visitor,	I’m	afraid.”
The	 house	 was	 perfect,
down	 to	 the	 dozens	 of	 cut
tulips	 in	 vases	 at	 the	 entry
hall.	 The	 air	 was	 so	 teasy
with	pollen,	my	eyes	watered.
Of	 course	 my	 mother	 didn’t
ask	me	what	kind	of	businesscould	 possibly	 land	 me	 here.
She	rarely	asked	questions	of
any	 potency.	 It	 was	 either	 an
exaggerated	 concern	 for
others’	privacy	or	she	simply
didn’t	care	much	about	much.
I’ll	 let	 you	 guess	 which
option	I	favored.
“Can	I	get	you	something
to	drink,	Camille?	Alan	and	I
were	 just	 having	 amaretto
sours.”	 She	 motioned	 to	 the
glass	in	her	hand.	“I	put	just	a
little	 bit	 of	 Sprite	 in	 it,sharpens	the	sweet.	But	I	also
have	 mango	 juice,	 wine,	 and
sweet	 tea,	 or	 ice	 water.	 Or
soda	 water.	 Where	 are	 you
staying?”
“Funny	 you	 ask	 that.	 I
was	hoping	I	could	stay	here.
Just	for	a	few	days.”
A	 quick	 pause,	 her	 long
fingernails,	 a	 transparent
pink,	 clicked	 on	 her	 glass.
“Well,	 I’m	 sure	 that’s	 fine.	 I
wish	 you’d	 phoned.	 Just	 so
I’d	have	known.	I	would	havehad	 dinner	 for	 you	 or
something.	Come	say	hello	to
Alan.	 We’re	 on	 the	 back
porch.”
She	 began	 walking	 away
from	me,	down	the	hallway—
luminous	 white	 living	 rooms
and	sitting	rooms	and	reading
rooms	 blooming	 out	 on	 all
sides—and	 I	 studied	 her.	 It
was	 the	 first	 time	 we’d	 seen
each	 other	 in	 almost	 a	 year.
My	hair	was	a	different	color
—brown	 from	 red—but	 shedidn’t	 seem	 to	 notice.	 She
looked	 exactly	 the	 same,
though,	not	much	older	than	I
am	now,	although	she’s	in	her
late	 forties.	 Glowing	 pale
skin,	 with	 long	 blonde	 hair
and	 pale	 blue	 eyes.	 She	 was
like	a	girl’s	very	best	doll,	the
kind	you	don’t	play	with.	She
was	 wearing	 a	 long,	 pink
cotton	 dress	 with	 little	 white
slippers.	She	was	twirling	her
amaretto	sour	without	spilling
a	drop.“Alan,	 Camille’s	 here.”
She	disappeared	into	the	back
kitchen	 (the	 smaller	 of	 two)
and	I	heard	her	crack	a	metal
ice	tray.
“Who?”
I	 peeked	 around	 the
corner,	 offered	 up	 a	 smile.
“Camille.	 I’m	 so	 sorry	 to
drop	in	like	this.”
You’d	 think	 a	 lovely
thing	 like	 my	 mother	 was
born	 to	 be	 with	 a	 big	 ex-
football	star.	She	would	havelooked	just	right	with	a	burly,
mustached	giant.	Alan	was,	if
anything,	 thinner	 than	 my
mother,	with	cheekbones	that
jutted	 out	 of	 his	 face	 so	 high
and	 sharp	 his	 eyes	 turned	 to
almond	 slivers.	 I	 wanted	 to
administer	 an	 IV	 when	 I	 saw
him.	 He	 overdressed	 always,
even	 for	 an	 evening	 of	 sweet
drinks	 with	 my	 mother.	 Now
he	sat,	needly	legs	jutting	out
of	 white	 safari	 shorts,	 with	 a
baby	 blue	 sweater	 drapedover	 a	 crisp	 oxford.	 He
sweated	not	at	all.	Alan	is	the
opposite	of	moist.
“Camille.	 It’s	 a	 pleasure.
A	 real	 pleasure,”	 he
murmured	 in	 his	 monotone
drawl.	 “All	 the	 way	 down	 in
Wind	 Gap.	 Thought	 you	 had
a	 moratorium	 on	 anything
south	of	Illinois.”
“Just	working,	actually.”
“Work.”	 He	 smiled.	 It
was	 the	 closest	 to	 a	 question
as	 I	 would	 get.	 My	 motherreappeared,	 her	 hair	 now
pulled	up	in	a	pale	blue	bow,
Wendy	Darling	all	grown	up.
She	pressed	a	chilled	glass	of
fizzing	 amaretto	 into	 my
hand,	 patted	 my	 shoulder
twice,	and	sat	away	from	me,
next	to	Alan.
“Those	 little	 girls,	 Ann
Nash	 and	 Natalie	 Keene,”	 I
prompted.	 “I’m	 covering	 it
for	my	paper.”
“Oh,	 Camille.”	 My
mother	 hushed	 me,	 lookingaway.	 When	 my	 mother	 is
piqued,	 she	 has	 a	 peculiar
tell:	 She	 pulls	 at	 her
eyelashes.	 Sometimes	 they
come	 out.	 During	 some
particularly	 difficult	 years
when	 I	 was	 a	 child,	 she	 had
no	 lashes	 at	 all,	 and	 her	 eyes
were	 a	 constant	 gluey	 pink,
vulnerable	 as	 a	 lab	 rabbit’s.
In	 winter	 time,	 they	 leaked
streaks	of	tears	whenever	she
went	outdoors.	Which	wasn’t
often.“It’s	my	assignment.”
“Goodness,	 what	 an
assignment,”	 she	 said,	 her
fingers	 hovering	 near	 her
eyes.	 She	 scratched	 the	 skin
just	 below	 and	 put	 her	 hand
in	 her	 lap.	 “Aren’t	 those
parents	 having	 a	 difficult
enough	 time	 without	 you
coming	 here	 to	 copy	 it	 all
down	 and	 spread	 it	 to	 the
world?	 ‘Wind	 Gap	 Murders
Its	 Children’!—is	 that	 what
you	want	people	to	think?”“A	 little	 girl	 has	 been
killed,	and	another	is	missing.
It’s	 my	 job	 to	 let	 people
know,	yes.”
“I	 knew	 those	 children,
Camille.	 I’m	 having	 a	 very
hard	 time,	 as	 you	 can
imagine.	 Dead	 little	 girls.
Who	would	do	that?”
I	took	a	slug	of	my	drink.
Granules	of	sugar	stuck	to	my
tongue.	 I	 was	 not	 ready	 to
speak	 with	 my	 mother.	 My
skin	hummed.“I	 won’t	 stay	 long.
Truly.”
Alan	refolded	the	cuffs	of
his	 sweater,	 smoothed	 his
hand	 down	 the	 crease	 of	 his
shorts.	His	contribution	to	our
conversations	 generally	 came
in	 the	 form	 of	 adjustments:	 a
collar	 tucked	 in,	 a	 leg
recrossed.
“I	 just	 can’t	 have	 that
kind	 of	 talk	 around	 me,”	 my
mother	 said.	 “About	 hurt
children.	 Just	 don’t	 tell	 mewhat	you’re	doing,	don’t	talk
about	anything	you	know.	I’ll
pretend	 you’re	 here	 for
summer	 break.”	 She	 traced
the	 braided	 wicker	 of	 Alan’s
chair	with	her	fingertip.
“How’s	 Amma?”	 I	 asked
to	change	the	subject.
“Amma?”	 My	 mother
looked	 alarmed,	 as	 if	 she
suddenly	 remembered	 she’d
left	 her	 child	 somewhere.
“She’s	 fine,	 she’s	 upstairs
asleep.	Why	do	you	ask?”I	knew	from	the	footsteps
I	 heard	 scampering	 up	 and
down	the	second	floor—from
the	 playroom	 to	 the	 sewing
room	to	the	hall	window	that
gave	 the	 best	 spying	 vantage
of	 the	 back	 porch—that
Amma	 was	 certainly	 not
asleep,	 but	 I	 didn’t	 begrudge
her	avoiding	me.
“Just	
being	
polite,
Momma.	 We	 do	 that	 up
north,	too.”	I	smiled	to	show	I
was	 teasing	 her,	 but	 sheburied	her	face	into	her	drink.
Came	 back	 up	 pink	 and
resolute.
“Stay	 as	 long	 as	 you
want,	 Camille,	 really,”	 she
said.	“But	you	will	have	to	be
kind	 to	 your	 sister.	 Those
girls	were	her	schoolmates.”
“I	look	forward	to	getting
to	 know	 her,”	 I	 mumbled.
“I’m	very	sorry	for	her	loss.”
The	 last	 words	 I	 couldn’t
resist,	 but	 my	 mother	 didn’t
notice	their	bitter	spin.“I’ll	 give	 you	 the
bedroom	 next	 to	 the	 sitting
room.	 Your	 old	 bedroom.	 It
has	 a	 tub.	 I’ll	 buy	 fresh	 fruit
and	 some	 toothpaste.	 And
steaks.	Do	you	eat	steak?”
	
Four	 hours	 of	 threadbare
sleep,	 like	 lying	 in	 a	 bathtub
with	
your	
ears	
half
submerged.	 Shooting	 up	 in
bed	every	twenty	minutes,	my
heart	 pounding	 so	 hard	 I
wondered	if	it	was	the	beatingthat	woke	me.	I	dreamt	I	was
packing	 for	 a	 trip,	 then
realized	 I’d	 laid	 out	 all	 the
wrong	clothes,	sweaters	for	a
summer	 vacation.	 I	 dreamt
I’d	 filed	 the	 wrong	 story	 for
Curry	before	I	left:	Instead	of
the	item	on	miserable	Tammy
Davis	and	her	four	locked-up
children,	 we’d	 run	 a	 puff
piece	about	skin	care.
I	 dreamt	 my	 mother	 was
slicing	 an	 apple	 onto	 thick
cuts	of	meat	and	feeding	it	tome,	 slowly	 and	 sweetly,
because	I	was	dying.
Just	 after	 5	 a.m.	 I	 finally
threw	 off	 the	 covers.	 I
washed	 Ann’s	 name	 off	 my
arm,	 but	 somehow,	 between
dressing,	 brushing	 my	 hair,
and	dabbing	on	some	lipstick,
I’d	 written	 Natalie	 Keene	 in
its	place.	I	decided	to	leave	it
for	luck.	Outside,	the	sun	was
just	 rising	 but	 my	 car	 handle
was	already	hot.	My	face	felt
numb	from	lack	of	sleep	and	Istretched	my	eyes	and	mouth
wide,	 like	 a	 B-movie	 scream
queen.	 The	 search	 party	 was
set	to	reconvene	at	6	a.m.	for
continued	work	in	the	woods;
I	 wanted	 to	 catch	 a	 quote
from	 Vickery	 before	 the	 day
began.	 Staking	 out	 the	 police
station	seemed	a	good	bet.
Main	Street	looked	vacant
at	first,	but	as	I	got	out	of	my
car	 I	 could	 see	 two	 people	 a
few	 blocks	 down.	 It	 was	 a
scene	that	made	no	sense.	Anolder	 woman	 was	 sitting	 in
the	 middle	 of	 the	 sidewalk,
legs	 splayed,	 staring	 at	 the
side	 of	 a	 building,	 while	 a
man	 was	 stooped	 over	 her.
The	 woman	 was	 shaking	 her
head	 manically,	 like	 a	 child
refusing	to	feed.	Her	legs	shot
out	 at	 angles	 that	 had	 to	 hurt
her.	A	bad	fall?	Heart	attack,
maybe.	 I	 walked	 briskly
toward	 them	 and	 could	 hear
their	staccato	murmuring.
The	 man,	 white	 hair	 andruined	 face,	 looked	 up	 at	 me
with	 milky	 eyes.	 “Get	 the
police,”	 he	 said.	 His	 voice
came	out	crumpled.	“And	call
an	ambulance.”
“What’s	 wrong?”	 I
started,	but	then	I	saw	it.
Wedged	 in	 the	 foot-wide
space	 between	 the	 hardware
store	 and	 the	 beauty	 parlor
was	a	tiny	body,	aimed	out	at
the	 sidewalk.	 As	 if	 she	 were
just	sitting	and	waiting	for	us,
brown	 eyes	 wide	 open.	 Irecognized	the	wild	curls.	But
the	 grin	 was	 gone.	 Natalie
Keene’s	 lips	 caved	 in	 around
her	 gums	 in	 a	 small	 circle.
She	looked	like	a	plastic	baby
doll,	 the	 kind	 with	 a	 built-in
hole	 for	 bottle	 feedings.
Natalie	had	no	teeth	now.
The	 blood	 hit	 my	 face
fast,	 and	 a	 shimmer	 of	 sweat
quickly	covered	my	skin.	My
legs	and	arms	went	slack,	and
for	a	second	I	thought	I	might
smack	 the	 ground	 right	 nextto	 the	 woman,	 who	 was	 now
quietly	 praying.	 I	 backed	 up,
leaned	 against	 a	 parked	 car,
and	 put	 my	 fingers	 to	 my
neck,	 willing	 my	 thumping
pulse	 to	 slow.	 My	 eyes
picked	 up	 images	 in
meaningless	 flashes:	 The
grimy	 rubber	 tip	 of	 the	 old
man’s	 cane.	 A	 pink	 mole	 on
the	 back	 of	 the	 woman’s
neck.	 The	 Band-Aid	 on
Natalie	Keene’s	knee.	I	could
feel	 her	 name	 glowing	 hotlyunder	my	shirtsleeve.
Then	 more	 voices,	 and
Chief	 Vickery	 was	 running
toward	us	with	a	man.
“Goddammit,”	 Vickery
grunted	 when	 he	 saw	 her.
“Goddammit.	 Jesus.”	 He	 put
his	 face	 against	 the	 brick	 of
the	 beauty	 parlor,	 and
breathed	 hard.	 The	 second
man,	 about	 my	 age,	 stooped
next	 to	 Natalie.	 A	 loop	 of
bruised	 purple	 circled	 her
neck,	 and	 he	 pressed	 hisfingers	 just	 above	 it	 to	 check
for	 a	 pulse.	 A	 stalling	 tactic
while	 he	 gathered	 his
composure—the	 child	 was
clearly	
dead.	
Big-shot
detective	from	Kansas	City,	I
guessed,	the	smug	kid.
He	 was	 good,	 though,
coaxing	the	woman	out	of	her
prayers	and	into	a	calm	story
of	 the	 discovery.	 The	 two
were	 husband	 and	 wife,	 the
owners	 of	 the	 diner	 whose
name	 I	 couldn’t	 rememberthe	 day	 before.	 Broussard.
They	 were	 on	 their	 way	 to
open	for	breakfast	when	they
found	 her.	 They’d	 been	 there
maybe	 five	 minutes	 before	 I
came	along.
A	 uniformed	 officer
arrived,	pulled	his	hands	over
his	 face	 when	 he	 saw	 what
he’d	been	called	for.
“Folks,	 we’re	 going	 to
need	 you	 to	 head	 to	 the
station	 with	 the	 officer	 here
so	 we	 can	 get	 somestatements,”	 Kansas	 City
said.	 “Bill.”	 His	 voice	 had	 a
parental	 sternness	 to	 it.
Vickery	 was	 kneeling	 by	 the
body,	 motionless.	 His	 lips
moved	 as	 if	 he	 might	 be
praying,	too.	His	name	had	to
be	 repeated	 twice	 before	 he
snapped	back.
“I	 hear	 you,	 Richard.	 Be
human	 for	 a	 second.”	 Bill
Vickery	 put	 his	 arms	 around
Mrs.	
Broussard	
and
murmured	 to	 her	 until	 shepatted	his	hand.
I	 sat	 in	 a	 room	 the	 color
of	 egg	 yolk	 for	 two	 hours
while	the	officer	got	my	story
down.	 The	 whole	 time	 I	 was
thinking	 about	 Natalie	 going
to	 autopsy,	 and	 how	 I	 would
like	 to	 sneak	 in	 and	 put	 a
fresh	Band-Aid	on	her	knee.	
Chapter	Three
My	 mother	 was	 wearing
blue	to	the	funeral.	Black	was
hopeless	 and	 any	 other	 color
was	 indecent.	 She	 also	 wore
blue	 to	 Marian’s	 funeral,	 and
so	 did	 Marian.	 She	 was
astonished	 I	 didn’t	 remember
this.	 I	 remembered	 Marian
being	 buried	 in	 a	 pale	 pink
dress.	 This	 was	 no	 surprise.
My	 mother	 and	 I	 generallydiffer	
on	
all	
things
concerning	my	dead	sister.
The	 morning	 of	 the
service	 Adora	 clicked	 in	 and
out	 of	 rooms	 on	 her	 heels,
here	 spraying	 perfume,	 there
fastening	 an	 earring.	 I
watched	 and	 drank	 hot	 black
coffee	with	a	burnt	tongue.
“I	don’t	know	them	well,”
she	 was	 saying.	 “They	 really
kept	to	themselves.	But	I	feel
all	 the	 community	 should
support	 them.	 Natalie	 wassuch	 a	 darling.	 People	 were
so	 kind	 to	 me	 when...”
Wistful	 downward	 glance.	 It
may	have	been	genuine.
I	 had	 been	 in	 Wind	 Gap
five	days	and	Amma	was	still
an	 unseen	 presence.	 My
mother	 didn’t	 mention	 her.
I’d	 also	 failed	 so	 far	 to	 get	 a
quote	 from	 the	 Keenes.	 Nor
had	 I	 gotten	 permission	 from
the	 family	 to	 attend	 the
funeral,	but	Curry	wanted	that
coverage	 more	 than	 I’d	 everheard	him	want	anything,	and
I	 wanted	 to	 prove	 I	 could
handle	 this.	 I	 figured	 the
Keenes	would	never	find	out.
No	one	reads	our	paper.
	
Murmured	 greetings	 and
perfumed	 hugs	 at	 Our	 Lady
of	 Sorrows,	 a	 few	 women
nodding	 politely	 at	 me	 after
they	 cooed	 over	 my	 mother
(so	brave	 of	 Adora	 to	 come)
and	 shoved	 down	 to	 make
room	 for	 her.	 Our	 Lady	 ofSorrows	 is	 a	 shiny	 ’70s
Catholic	 church:	 bronzy-gold
and	 bejeweled,	 like	 a	 dime-
store	ring.	Wind	Gap	is	a	tiny
holdout	 of	 Catholicism	 in	 a
region	 of	 booming	 Southern
Baptists,	 the	 town	 having
been	 founded	 by	 a	 pack	 of
Irish.	 All	 the	 McMahons	 and
Malones	landed	in	New	York
during	the	Potato	Famine,	got
generously	 abused,	 and	 (if
they	 were	 smart)	 headed
west.	 The	 French	 alreadyreigned	 in	 St.	 Louis,	 so	 they
turned	south	and	started	their
own	 towns.	 But	 they	 were
unceremoniously	 pushed	 out
years	
later	
during
Reconstruction.	
Missouri,
always	 a	 conflicted	 place,
was	 trying	 to	 shed	 its
southern	 roots,	 reinvent	 itself
as	 a	 proper	 nonslave	 state,
and	 the	 embarrassing	 Irish
were	 swept	 out	 with	 other
undesirables.	 They	 left	 their
religion	behind.Ten	 minutes	 till	 the
service,	 and	 a	 line	 was
forming	 to	 gain	 entry	 to	 the
church.	 I	 surveyed	 the
crowded	 seat	 holders	 inside.
Something	was	wrong.	There
was	 not	 one	 child	 in	 the
church.	 No	 boys	 in	 dark
trousers,	 rolling	 trucks	 over
their	 mothers’	 legs,	 no	 girls
cradling	rag	dolls.	Not	a	face
younger	 than	 fifteen.	 I	 didn’t
know	 if	 it	 was	 out	 of	 respect
for	the	parents,	or	fear-drivendefense.	 An	 instinct	 to
prevent	 one’s	 children	 from
being	picked	as	future	prey.	I
pictured	 hundreds	 of	 Wind
Gap	 sons	 and	 daughters
tucked	 away	 in	 dark	 den
rooms,	 sucking	 the	 backs	 of
their	 hands	 while	 they
watched	 TV	 and	 remained
unmarked.
Without	 kids	 to	 tend	 to,
the	 churchgoers	 seemed
static,	like	paperboard	cutouts
holding	 the	 places	 of	 realpeople.	 In	 the	 back,	 I	 could
see	 Bob	 Nash	 in	 a	 dark	 suit.
Still	 no	 wife.	 He	 nodded	 at
me,	then	frowned.
	
The	 organ	 pipes	 exhaled
the	muffled	tones	of	“Be	Not
Afraid,”	 and	 Natalie	 Keene’s
family,	until	then	crying,	and
hugging,	and	fussing	near	the
door	 like	 one	 massive	 failing
heart,	 filed	 tightly	 together.
Only	two	men	were	needed	to
carry	 the	 shiny	 white	 coffin.Any	 more	 and	 they	 would
have	been	bumping	into	each
other.
Natalie’s	 mother	 and
father	led	the	procession.	She
was	 three	 inches	 taller	 than
he,	 a	 large,	 warm-looking
woman	 with	 sandy	 hair	 held
back	 with	 a	 headband.	 She
had	 an	 open	 face,	 the	 kind
that	 would	 prompt	 strangers
to	 ask	 for	 directions	 or	 the
time.	 Mr.	 Keene	 was	 small
and	thin,	with	a	round	child’sface	 made	 rounder	 by	 wire
spectacles	 that	 looked	 like
two	gold	bike	wheels.	Behind
them	 walked	 a	 beautiful	 boy
of	 eighteen	 or	 nineteen,	 his
brunette	 head	 bowed	 into	 his
chest,	 sobbing.	 Natalie’s
brother,	 a	 woman	 whispered
behind	me.
Tears	 ran	 down	 my
mother’s	 cheeks	 and	 dripped
loudly	 onto	 the	 leather	 purse
she	 held	 in	 her	 lap.	 The
woman	next	to	her	patted	herhand.	 I	 slipped	 my	 notepad
from	 my	 jacket	 pocket	 and
began	scribbling	notes	to	one
side	 until	 my	 mother	 slapped
her	hand	on	mine	and	hissed,
“You	 are	 being	 disrespectful
and	 embarrassing.	 Stop	 or	 I
will	make	you	leave.”
I	quit	writing	but	kept	the
pad	 out,	 feeling	 stabbingly
defiant.	But	still	blushing.
The	 procession	 moved
past	 us.	 The	 coffin	 seemed
ludicrously	 small.	 I	 picturedNatalie	 inside	 and	 could	 see
her	 legs	 again—downy	 hair,
knobby	 knees,	 the	 Band-Aid.
I	 ached	 once,	 hard,	 like	 a
period	 typed	 at	 the	 end	 of	 a
sentence.
As	 the	 priest	 murmured
the	 opening	 prayers	 in	 his
best	 vestments,	 and	 we	 stood
and	 sat,	 and	 stood	 again,
prayer	cards	were	distributed.
On	the	front,	the	Virgin	Mary
beamed	 her	 bright	 red	 heart
down	 on	 baby	 Jesus.	 On	 theback	was	printed:
Natalie	Jane	Keene
Darling	 daughter,
sister	and	friend
Heaven	 has	 a	 new
angel
A	 large	 photo	 of	 Natalie
perched	 near	 the	 coffin,	 a
more	 formal	 photo	 than	 the
one	 I’d	 seen	 before.	 She	 was
a	 sweet,	 homely	 little	 thing,
with	 a	 pointy	 chin	 and
slightly	 bulbous	 eyes,	 the
kind	 of	 girl	 who	 might	 havegrown	 up	 to	 be	 strangely
striking.	 She	 could	 have
delighted	 men	 with	 ugly-
duckling	 stories	 that	 were
actually	 true.	 Or	 she	 might
have	 remained	 a	 sweet,
homely	 little	 thing.	 At	 ten,	 a
girl’s	looks	are	fickle.
Natalie’s	 mother	 made
her	 way	 to	 the	 podium,
clutching	 a	 piece	 of	 paper.
Her	 face	 was	 wet,	 but	 her
voice	 was	 solid	 when	 she
began	speaking.“This	is	a	letter	to	Natalie,
my	 only	 daughter.”	 She	 took
a	shaky	breath	and	the	words
streamed	 out.	 “Natalie,	 you
were	 my	 dearest	 girl.	 I	 can’t
believe	 you	 have	 been	 taken
from	 us.	 Never	 again	 will	 I
sing	 you	 to	 sleep	 or	 tickle
your	 back	 with	 my	 fingers.
Never	again	will	your	brother
get	 to	 twirl	 your	 pigtails,	 or
your	 father	 hold	 you	 on	 his
lap.	Your	father	will	not	walk
you	 down	 the	 aisle.	 Yourbrother	 will	 never	 be	 an
uncle.	 We	 will	 miss	 you	 at
our	 Sunday	 dinners	 and	 our
summer	 vacations.	 We	 will
miss	 your	 laughter.	 We	 will
miss	 your	 tears.	 Mostly,	 my
dear	 daughter,	 we	 will	 miss
you.	We	love	you,	Natalie.”
As	 Mrs.	 Keene	 walked
back	to	her	seat,	her	husband
rushed	 up	 to	 her,	 but	 she
seemed	to	need	no	steadying.
As	soon	as	she	sat	down,	the
boy	 was	 back	 in	 her	 arms,crying	 in	 the	 crook	 of	 her
neck.	 Mr.	 Keene	 blinked
angrily	 at	 the	 church	 pews
behind	 him,	 as	 if	 looking	 for
someone	to	hit.
“It	is	a	terrible	tragedy	to
lose	 a	 child,”	 intoned	 the
priest.	“It	is	doubly	terrible	to
lose	 her	 to	 such	 evil	 doings.
For	evil	is	what	they	are.	The
Bible	says,	‘An	eye	for	an	eye
and	 a	 tooth	 for	 a	 tooth.’	 But
let	 us	 not	 dwell	 on	 revenge.
Let	 us	 think	 instead	 of	 whatJesus	 urged:	 Love	 thy
neighbor.	 Let	 us	 be	 good	 to
our	neighbors	in	this	difficult
time.	 Lift	 up	 your	 hearts	 to
God.”
“I	liked	the	eye	for	an	eye
stuff	better,”	grumbled	a	man
behind	me.
I	wondered	if	the	tooth	for
a	tooth	part	disturbed	anyone
else.
When	 we	 emerged	 from
the	 church	 into	 the	 day’s
glare,	 I	 could	 make	 out	 fourgirls	 sitting	 in	 a	 row	 along	 a
stumpy	wall	across	the	street.
Long	 colt	 legs	 dangling
down.	Breasts	rounded	out	by
pushup	 bras.	 The	 same	 girls
I’d	run	into	at	the	edge	of	the
forest.	 They	 were	 huddled
together	laughing	until	one	of
them,	 again	 the	 prettiest,
motioned	 over	 at	 me,	 and
they	 all	 pretended	 to	 hang
their	 heads.	 Their	 stomachs
were	still	jiggling,	though.
	Natalie	 was	 buried	 in	 the
family	 plot,	 next	 to	 a
gravestone	 that	 already	 bore
her	 parents’	 names.	 I	 know
the	 wisdom,	 that	 no	 parents
should	see	their	child	die,	that
such	 an	 event	 is	 like	 nature
spun	 backward.	 But	 it’s	 the
only	 way	 to	 truly	 keep	 your
child.	 Kids	 grow	 up,	 they
forge	
more	
potent
allegiances.	 They	 find	 a
spouse	 or	 a	 lover.	 They	 will
not	 be	 buried	 with	 you.	 TheKeenes,	however,	will	remain
the	 purest	 form	 of	 family.
Underground.
	
After	 the	 funeral,	 people
gathered	 at	 the	 Keene	 home,
a	massive	stone	farmhouse,	a
moneyed	 vision	 of	 pastoral
America.	 It	 was	 like	 nothing
else	 in	 Wind	 Gap.	 Missouri
money	 distances	 itself	 from
bucolicry,	 from	 such	 country
quaintness.	 Consider:	 In
colonial	 America,	 wealthywomen	wore	subtle	shades	of
blues	 and	 grays	 to	 counter
their	crass	New	World	image,
while	
their	
wealthy
counterparts	in	England	tarted
up	 like	 exotic	 birds.	 In	 short,
the	 Keene	 home	 looked	 too
Missouri	 to	 be	 owned	 by
Missourians.
The	 buffet	 table	 held
mainly	 meats:	 turkey	 and
ham,	beef	and	venison.	There
were	 pickles	 and	 olives	 and
deviled	 eggs;	 shiny,	 hardrolls;	 and	 crusted	 casseroles.
The	
guests	
segregated
themselves	 into	 two	 groups,
the	 tearful	 and	 the	 dry.	 The
stoics	 stood	 in	 the	 kitchen,
drinking	 coffee	 and	 liquor
and	 talking	 about	 upcoming
city-council	 elections	 and	 the
future	 of	 the	 schools,
occasionally	 pausing	 to
whisper	 angrily	 about	 the
lack	of	progress	in	the	murder
cases.
“I	 swear	 I	 see	 someone	 Idon’t	 know	 coming	 near	 my
girls,	 I’ll	 shoot	 the	 sumbitch
before	 ‘Hello’	 comes	 out	 his
mouth,”	said	one	spade-faced
man,	 flapping	 a	 roast	 beef
sandwich.	His	friends	nodded
in	agreement.
“I	 don’t	 know	 why	 the
hell	 Vickery	 hasn’t	 emptied
out	 the	 forest—hell,	 raze	 the
whole	 goddam	 thing.	 You
know	 he’s	 in	 there,”	 said	 a
younger	 man	 with	 orange
hair.“Donnie,	 I’ll	 go	 out	 there
tomorrow	with	you,”	said	the
spade-faced	 man.	 “We	 can
just	take	it	acre	by	acre.	We’ll
find	 the	 son	 of	 a	 bitch.	 Ya’ll
wanna	 come?”	 The	 men
muttered	 assents	 and	 drank
more	liquor	from	their	plastic
cups.	 I	 made	 a	 note	 to	 cruise
past	 the	 roads	 near	 the	 forest
in	 the	 morning,	 to	 see	 if
hangovers	 had	 given	 way	 to
action	 or	 not.	 But	 I	 could
already	 picture	 the	 sheepishphone	calls	in	the	morning:
You	going?
Well,	 I	 don’t	 know,	 I
guess,	you?
Well,	 I	 promised	 Maggie
I’d	 take	 down	 the	 storm
windows....
Agreements	 to	 meet	 for
beers	 later,	 and	 the	 receivers
compressed	 very	 slowly	 to
muffle	the	guilty	click.
Those	 who	 wept,	 mostly
women,	 did	 so	 in	 the	 front
room,	 on	 plush	 sofas	 andleather	 ottomans.	 Natalie’s
brother	 was	 there	 shaking	 in
the	arms	of	his	mother,	as	she
rocked	him	and	cried	silently,
patting	 down	 his	 dark	 hair.
Sweet	 kid,	 to	 cry	 so	 openly.
I’d	 never	 seen	 such	 a	 thing.
Ladies	 came	 by	 with	 paper-
plate	 offerings	 of	 food,	 but
mother	 and	 son	 just	 shook
their	 heads	 no.	 My	 mother
fluttered	 around	 them	 like	 a
manic	 bluejay,	 but	 they	 took
no	 notice,	 and	 soon	 she	 wasoff	 to	 her	 circle	 of	 friends.
Mr.	 Keene	 stood	 in	 a	 corner
with	 Mr.	 Nash,	 both	 of	 them
smoking	silently.
Recent	 evidence	 of
Natalie	 was	 still	 scattered
around	 the	 room.	 A	 small
gray	 sweater	 folded	 over	 the
back	 of	 a	 chair,	 a	 pair	 of
tennis	 shoes	 with	 bright	 blue
laces	 by	 the	 door.	 On	 one	 of
the	 bookshelves	 sat	 a	 spiral
notebook	 with	 a	 unicorn	 on
the	 front,	 in	 a	 magazine	 rackwas	 a	 dog-eared	 copy	 of	 A
Wrinkle	in	Time.
I	 was	 rotten.	 I	 didn’t
approach	 the	 family,	 didn’t
announce	 myself.	 I	 walked
through	 their	 home	 and	 I
spied,	 my	 head	 down	 in	 my
beer	 like	 a	 shamed	 ghost.	 I
saw	Katie	Lacey,	my	old	best
friend	from	Calhoon	High,	in
her	 own	 well-coiffed	 circle,
the	 exact	 mirror	 of	 my
mother’s	group,	minus	twenty
years.	 She	 kissed	 me	 on	 thecheek	when	I	approached.
“Heard	you	were	in	town,
was	 hoping	 you’d	 phone,”
she	said,	wrinkling	her	thinly
plucked	eyebrows	at	me,	then
passing	 me	 off	 to	 the	 three
other	 women,	 all	 of	 whom
crowded	 in	 to	 give	 me	 limp
hugs.	 All	 of	 whom	 had	 been
my	 friends	 at	 one	 point,	 I
suppose.	 We	 exchanged
condolences	 and	 murmured
about	 how	 sad	 this	 was.
Angie	 Papermaker	 (néeKnightley)	 looked	 like	 she
was	 still	 battling	 the	 bulimia
that’d	 whittled	 her	 down	 in
high	school—her	neck	was	as
thin	 and	 ropy	 as	 an	 old
woman’s.	 Mimi,	 a	 spoiled
rich	girl	(Daddy	owned	acres
of	 chicken	 lots	 down	 in
Arkansas)	 who’d	 never	 liked
me	 much,	 asked	 about
Chicago	
and	
then
immediately	 turned	 to	 talk	 to
tiny	 little	 Tish,	 who	 had
decided	to	hold	my	hand	in	acomforting	 but	 peculiar
gesture.
Angie	 announced	 to	 me
that	 she	 had	 a	 five-year-old
daughter—her	 husband	 was
at	 home	 with	 his	 gun,
watching	over	her.
“It’s	 going	 to	 be	 a	 long
summer	 for	 the	 little	 ones,”
Tish	 murmured.	 “I	 think
everyone’s	 keeping	 their
babies	under	lock	and	key.”	I
thought	 about	 the	 girls	 I’d
seen	 outside	 the	 funeral,	 notmuch	 older	 than	 Natalie,	 and
wondered	 why	 their	 parents
weren’t	worried.
“You	
have	
kids,
Camille?”	 Angie	 asked	 in	 a
voice	 as	 thin	 as	 her	 body.	 “I
don’t	 even	 know	 if	 you’re
married.”
“No	 and	 no,”	 I	 said,	 and
took	 a	 slurp	 of	 my	 beer,
flashing	 an	 image	 of	 Angie
vomiting	 at	 my	 house	 after
school,	 emerging	 from	 the
bathroom	
pink	
andtriumphant.	
Curry	
was
wrong:	 Being	 an	 insider	 here
was	 more	 distracting	 than
useful.
“Ladies,	you	can’t	hog	the
out-of-towner	 all	 night!”	 I
turned	 to	 see	 one	 of	 my
mother’s	 friends,	 Jackie
O’Neele	 (née	 O’Keefe),
who’d	 clearly	 just	 had	 a
facelift.	 Her	 eyes	 were	 still
puffy	and	her	face	was	moist
and	 red	 and	 stretched,	 as	 if
she	 was	 an	 angry	 babysqueezing	 out	 of	 the	 womb.
Diamonds	 flashed	 on	 her
tanned	 fingers,	 and	 she
smelled	 of	 Juicy	 Fruit	 and
talc	 when	 she	 hugged	 me.
The	 evening	 was	 feeling	 too
much	 like	 a	 reunion.	 And	 I
was	 feeling	 too	 much	 like	 a
kid	 again—I	 hadn’t	 even
dared	to	pull	out	my	notebook
with	 my	 mother	 still	 here,
shooting	me	warning	glances.
“Baby	 girl,	 you	 look	 so
pretty,”	 Jackie	 purred.	 Shehad	 a	 melon	 of	 a	 head,
covered	 with	 overbleached
hair,	 and	 a	 leering	 smile.
Jackie	was	catty	and	shallow,
but	 she	 was	 always
completely	 herself.	 She	 also
was	 more	 at	 ease	 with	 me
than	 my	 own	 mother.	 It	 was
Jackie,	 not	 Adora,	 who
slipped	 me	 my	 first	 box	 of
tampons,	 winking	 that	 I
should	 phone	 her	 if	 I	 needed
instructions,	 and	 Jackie
who’d	 always	 teased	 memerrily	 about	 boys.	 Small
huge	gestures.	“How	are	you,
darling?	 Your	 momma	 didn’t
tell	me	you	were	in	town.	But
your	 momma	 isn’t	 talking	 to
me	right	now—I	disappointed
her	 again	 somehow.	 You
know	 how	 that	 goes.	 I	 know
you	 know!”	 She	 let	 out	 a
rocky	 smoker’s	 laugh	 and
squeezed	 my	 arm.	 I	 assumed
she	was	drunk.
“I	probably	forgot	to	send
her	a	card	for	something,”	shebabbled	 on,	 overgesturing
with	 the	 hand	 that	 held	 a
glass	of	wine.	“Or	maybe	that
gardener	 I	 recommended
didn’t	 please	 her.	 I	 heard
you’re	doing	a	story	about	the
girls;	 that’s	 just	 rough.”	 Her
conversation	 was	 so	 bumpy
and	 abrupt	 it	 took	 me	 a
minute	to	process	everything.
By	the	time	I	started	to	speak,
she	 was	 caressing	 my	 arm
and	 staring	 at	 me	 with	 wet
eyes.	 “Camille,	 baby,	 it’sbeen	so	damn	long	since	I’ve
seen	you.	And	now—I	look	at
you	 and	 I	 see	 you	 when	 you
were	 the	 same	 age	 as	 those
girls.	 And	 I	 just	 feel	 so	 sad.
So	 much	 has	 gone	 wrong.	 I
can’t	 make	 sense	 of	 it.”	 A
tear	 trailed	 down	 her	 cheek.
“Look	 me	 up,	 okay?	 We	 can
talk.”
I	 left	 the	 Keene	 house
with	no	quotes.	I	was	already
tired	 of	 talking,	 and	 I’d	 said
very	little.	
I	 called	 the	 Keenes	 later,
after	I’d	had	more	to	drink—a
to-go	cup	of	vodka	from	their
stash—and	
was	
safely
segregated	 by	 phone	 lines.
Then	 I	 explained	 myself	 and
what	 I	 would	 write.	 It	 didn’t
go	well.
	
Here’s	 what	 I	 filed	 that
night:
	
In	 tiny	 Wind	 Gap,Missouri,	
posters
pleading	 for	 the	 return
of	 10-year-old	 Natalie
Jane	 Keene	 were	 still
hanging	 as	 they	 buried
the	 little	 girl	 on
Tuesday.	 A	 vibrant
funeral	 service,	 at
which	 the	 priest	 spoke
of	 forgiveness	 and
redemption,	did	little	to
calm	 nerves	 or	 heal
wounds.	That’s	because
the	 healthy,	 sweet-faced	 young	 girl	 was
the	 second	 victim	 of
what	police	presume	to
be	 a	 serial	 killer.	 A
serial	 killer	 who’s
targeting	children.
“All	 the	 little	 ones
here	 are	 sweethearts,”
said	 local	 farmer
Ronald	J.	Kamens,	who
assisted	 in	 the	 search
for	 Keene.	 “I	 can’t
imagine	 why	 this	 is
happening	to	us.”Keene’s	 strangled
body	 was	 discovered
May	 14,	 crammed	 into
a	 space	 between	 two
buildings	 on	 Wind
Gap’s	 Main	 Street.
“We	 will	 miss	 her
laughter,”	 said	 Jeannie
Keene,	 52,	 mother	 of
Natalie.	 “We	 will	 miss
her	 tears.	 Mostly,	 we
will	miss	Natalie.”
This,	 however,	 is
not	 the	 first	 tragedyWind	 Gap,	 located	 in
the	 boot	 heel	 of	 the
state,	 has	 withstood.
Last	 August	 27,	 nine-
year-old	Ann	Nash	was
found	 in	 an	 area	 creek,
also	 strangled.	 She	 had
been	 bicycling	 just	 a
few	 blocks	 to	 visit	 a
friend	 when	 she	 was
abducted	 the	 night
before.	 Both	 victims
reportedly	 had	 their
teeth	 removed	 by	 thekiller.
The	 murders	 have
left	 the	 five-person
Wind	 Gap	 police	 force
baffled.	
Lacking
experience	 in	 such
brutal	 crimes,	 they
have	 elicited	 help	 from
the	
Kansas	
City
homicide	
division,
which	 has	 sent	 an
officer	 trained	 in	 the
psychological	 profiling
of	murderers.	Residentsof	 the	 town	 (pop.
2,120)	 are,	 however,
sure	 of	 one	 thing:	 The
person	 responsible	 for
the	 slayings	 is	 killing
with	 no	 particular
motive.
“There	is	a	man	out
there	looking	for	babies
to	 kill,”	 says	 Ann’s
father,	Bob	Nash,	41,	a
chair	
salesman.
“There’s	 no	 hidden
drama	 here,	 no	 secrets.Someone	just	killed	our
little	girl.”
The	 removal	 of	 the
teeth	 has	 remained	 a
point	 of	 mystery,	 and
clues	 thus	 far	 have
been	 minimal.	 Local
police	 have	 declined	 to
comment.	 Until	 these
murders	 are	 resolved,
Wind	 Gap	 protects	 its
own—a	 curfew	 is	 in
effect,	
and
neighborhood	 watcheshave	 sprung	 up	 over
this	once-quiet	town.
The	 residents	 also
try	 to	 heal	 themselves.
“I	don’t	want	to	talk	to
anyone,”	 says	 Jeannie
Keene.	 “I	 just	 want	 to
be	 left	 alone.	 We	 all
want	to	be	left	alone.”
	
Hack	 work—you	 don’t
need	to	tell	me	that.	Even	as	I
e-mailed	Curry	the	file,	I	was
already	 regretting	 nearlyeverything	 about	 it.	 Stating
that	 police	 presumed	 the
murders	were	committed	by	a
serial	 killer	 was	 a	 stretch.
Vickery	 never	 said	 anything
of	 the	 sort.	 The	 first	 Jeannie
Keene	 quote	 I	 stole	 from	 her
eulogy.	 The	 second	 I	 yanked
from	the	vitriol	she	spewed	at
me	 when	 she	 realized	 my
phone	 condolences	 were	 a
front.	 She	 knew	 I	 planned	 to
dissect	 her	 girl’s	 murder,	 lay
it	 out	 on	 butcher	 paper	 forstrangers	to	chew	on.	“We	all
want	 to	 be	 left	 alone!”	 she
yelped.	 “We	 buried	 our	 baby
today.	 Shame	 on	 you.”	 A
quote	 nonetheless,	 a	 quote	 I
needed,	 since	 Vickery	 was
shutting	me	out.
Curry	 thought	 the	 piece
was	 solid—not	 great,	 mind
you,	but	a	solid	start.	He	even
left	 in	 my	 overfried	 line:	 “A
serial	 killer	 who’s	 targeting
children.”	 That	 should	 have
been	 cut,	 I	 knew	 it	 myself,but	 I	 craved	 the	 dramatic
padding.	 He	 must	 have	 been
drunk	when	he	read	it.
He	 ordered	 a	 larger
feature	 on	 the	 families,	 soon
as	 I	 could	 scrape	 it	 together.
Another	 chance	 to	 redeem
myself.	 I	 was	 lucky—it
looked	like	the	Chicago	Daily
Post	might	have	Wind	Gap	to
ourselves	 for	 a	 bit	 longer.	 A
congressional	 sex	 scandal
was	 unraveling	 delightfully,
destroying	 not	 just	 oneaustere	 House	 member,	 but
three.	 Two	 of	 them	 women.
Lurid,	 juicy	 stuff.	 More
importantly,	there	was	a	serial
killer	 stalking	 a	 more
glamorous	city,	Seattle.	Amid
the	 fog	 and	 coffeehouses,
someone	 was	 carving	 up
pregnant	 women,	 opening
their	 bellies,	 and	 arranging
the	 contents	 in	 shocking
tableaux	 for	 his	 own
amusement.	 Thus	 it	 was	 our
good	 fortune	 that	 reportersfor	this	type	of	thing	were	out
of	 commission.	 There	 was
just	 me,	 left	 wretched	 in	 my
childhood	bed.
	
I	
slept	
late	
into
Wednesday,	 sweaty	 sheets
and	 blankets	 pulled	 over	 my
head.	 Woke	 several	 times	 to
phones	 ringing,	 the	 maid
vacuuming	 outside	 my	 door,
a	 lawn	 mower.	 I	 was
desperate	 to	 remain	 asleep,
but	 the	 day	 kept	 bobbingthrough.	 I	 kept	 my	 eyes
closed	 and	 imagined	 myself
back	 in	 Chicago,	 on	 my
rickety	 slice	 of	 a	 bed	 in	 my
studio	 apartment	 facing	 the
brick	back	of	a	supermarket.	I
had	 a	 cardboard	 dresser
purchased	at	that	supermarket
when	 I	 moved	 in	 four	 years
ago,	 and	 a	 plastic	 table	 on
which	 I	 ate	 from	 a	 set	 of
weightless	 yellow	 plates	 and
bent,	tinny	flatware.	I	worried
that	I	hadn’t	watered	my	loneplant,	 a	 slightly	 yellow	 fern
I’d	 found	 by	 my	 neighbors’
trash.	Then	I	remembered	I’d
tossed	the	dead	thing	out	two
months	ago.	I	tried	to	imagine
other	 images	 from	 my	 life	 in
Chicago:	my	cubicle	at	work,
my	 superintendent	 who	 still
didn’t	 know	 my	 name,	 the
dull	 green	 Christmas	 lights
the	 supermarket	 had	 yet	 to
take	 down.	 A	 scattering	 of
friendly	 acquaintances	 who
probably	 hadn’t	 noticed	 I’dbeen	gone.
I	 hated	 being	 in	 Wind
Gap,	 but	 home	 held	 no
comfort	either.
I	 pulled	 a	 flask	 of	 warm
vodka	 from	 my	 duffel	 bag
and	 got	 back	 in	 bed.	 Then,
sipping,	 I	 assessed	 my
surroundings.	 I’d	 expected
my	 mother	 to	 pave	 over	 my
bedroom	 as	 soon	 as	 I’d	 left
the	 house,	 but	 it	 looked
exactly	as	it	was	more	than	a
decade	 before.	 I	 regrettedwhat	 a	 serious	 teenager	 I’d
been:	 There	 were	 no	 posters
of	 pop	 stars	 or	 favorite
movies,	no	girlish	collections
of	photos	or	corsages.	Instead
there	 were	 paintings	 of
sailboats,	 proper	 pastel
pastorals,	 a	 portrait	 of
Eleanor	 Roosevelt.	 The	 latter
was	 particularly	 strange,
since	 I’d	 known	 little	 about
Mrs.	 Roosevelt,	 except	 that
she	 was	 good,	 which	 at	 the
time	 I	 suppose	 was	 enough.Given	 my	 druthers	 now,	 I’d
prefer	 a	 snapshot	 of	 Warren
Harding’s	
wife,	
“the
Duchess,”	 who	 recorded	 the
smallest	 offenses	 in	 a	 little
red	 notebook	 and	 avenged
herself	 accordingly.	 Today	 I
like	 my	 first	 ladies	 with	 a
little	bite.
I	 drank	 more	 vodka.
There	 was	 nothing	 I	 wanted
to	 do	 more	 than	 be
unconscious	 again,	 wrapped
in	 black,	 gone	 away.	 I	 wasraw.	 I	 felt	 swollen	 with
potential	 tears,	 like	 a	 water
balloon	 filled	 to	 burst.
Begging	for	a	pin	prick.	Wind
Gap	 was	 unhealthy	 for	 me.
This	home	was	unhealthy	for
me.
A	quiet	knock	at	the	door,
little	 more	 than	 a	 rattling
gust.
“Yes?”	I	tucked	my	glass
of	 vodka	 to	 the	 side	 of	 the
bed.
“Camille?	 It’s	 yourmother.”
“Yes?”
“I	 brought	 you	 some
lotion.”
I	walked	to	the	door	a	bit
blurrily,	the	vodka	giving	me
that	 first	 necessary	 layer	 to
deal	with	this	particular	place
on	 this	 particular	 day.	 I’d
been	good	about	booze	for	six
months,	 but	 nothing	 counted
here.	 Outside	 my	 door	 my
mother	 hovered,	 peering	 in
warily	as	if	it	were	the	trophyroom	 of	 a	 dead	 child.	 Close.
She	 held	 out	 a	 large	 pale
green	tube.
“It	has	vitamin	E.	I	picked
it	up	this	morning.”
My	mother	believes	in	the
palliative	 effects	 of	 vitamin
E,	 as	 if	 slathering	 enough	 on
will	 make	 me	 smooth	 and
flawless	 again.	 It	 hasn’t
worked	yet.
“Thank	you.”
Her	 eyes	 scanned	 across
my	 neck,	 my	 arms,	 my	 legs,all	 bared	 by	 the	 lone	 T-shirt
I’d	 worn	 to	 bed.	 Then	 back
with	a	frown	to	my	face.	She
sighed	 and	 shook	 her	 head
slightly.	 Then	 she	 just	 stood
there.
“Was	 the	 funeral	 very
hard	on	you,	Momma?”	Even
now,	I	couldn’t	resist	making
a	
small	
conversational
offering.
“It	 was.	 So	 much	 was
similar.	That	little	casket.”
“It	was	hard	for	me,	too,”I	 nudged.	 “I	 was	 actually
surprised	 how	 hard.	 I	 miss
her.	Still.	Isn’t	that	weird?”
“It	would	be	weird	if	you
didn’t.	 She’s	 your	 sister.	 It’s
almost	 as	 painful	 as	 losing	 a
child.	 Even	 though	 you	 were
so	 young.”	 Downstairs,	 Alan
was	whistling	elaborately,	but
my	 mother	 seemed	 not	 to
hear.	 “I	 didn’t	 care	 much	 for
that	open	letter	Jeannie	Keene
read,”	 she	 continued.	 “It’s	 a
funeral,	 not	 a	 political	 rally.And	 why	 were	 they	 all
dressed	so	informally?”
“I	 thought	 the	 letter	 was
nice.	 It	 was	 heartfelt,”	 I	 said.
“Didn’t	 you	 read	 anything	 at
Marian’s	funeral?”
“No,	 no.	 I	 could	 barely
stand,	 much	 less	 give
speeches.	 I	 can’t	 believe	 you
can’t	 remember	 these	 things,
Camille.	 I’d	 think	 you’d	 be
embarrassed	to	have	forgotten
so	much.”
“I	was	only	thirteen	whenshe	
died,	
Momma.
Remember,	 I	 was	 young.”
Nearly	 twenty	 years	 ago,	 can
that	be	right?
“Yes,	 well.	 Enough.	 Is
there	 anything	 you’d	 like	 to
do	 today?	 The	 roses	 are	 in
bloom	 at	 Daly	 Park,	 if	 you’d
like	a	walk.”
“I	 should	 go	 over	 to	 the
police	station.”
“Don’t	 say	 that	 while
you’re	 staying	 here,”	 she
snapped.	 “Say	 you	 haveerrands	 to	 run,	 or	 friends	 to
see.”
“I	have	errands	to	run.”
“Fine.	Enjoy.”
She	 padded	 away	 down
the	 plush	 corridor,	 and	 I
heard	the	stairs	creak	quickly
downward.
I	 washed	 up	 in	 a	 cool,
shallow	 bath,	 lights	 off,
another	 glass	 of	 vodka
balanced	 on	 the	 side	 of	 the
tub,	 then	 dressed	 and	 entered
the	 hallway.	 The	 house	 wassilent,	as	silent	as	its	century-
old	 structure	 would	 allow.	 I
heard	 a	 fan	 whirring	 in	 the
kitchen	 as	 I	 stood	 outside	 to
make	 sure	 no	 one	 was	 there.
Then	 I	 slipped	 in,	 grabbed	 a
bright	 green	 apple,	 and	 bit
into	 it	 as	 I	 walked	 out	 of	 the
house.	The	sky	was	cloudless.
	
Outside	 on	 the	 porch	 I
saw	a	changeling.	A	little	girl
with	 her	 face	 aimed	 intently
at	 a	 huge,	 four-footdollhouse,	 fashioned	 to	 look
exactly	 like	 my	 mother’s
home.	 Long	 blonde	 hair
drifted	 in	 disciplined	 rivulets
down	her	back,	which	was	to
me.	 As	 she	 turned,	 I	 realized
it	was	the	girl	I’d	spoken	to	at
the	 edge	 of	 the	 woods,	 the
girl	 who’d	 been	 laughing
with	 her	 friends	 outside
Natalie’s	
funeral.	
The
prettiest	one.
“Amma?”	 I	 asked,	 and
she	laughed.“Naturally.	 Who	 else
would	be	playing	on	Adora’s
front	porch	with	a	little	Adora
house?”
The	girl	was	in	a	childish
checked	 sundress,	 matching
straw	 hat	 by	 her	 side.	 She
looked	 entirely	 her	 age—
thirteen—for	 the	 first	 time
since	 I’d	 seen	 her.	 Actually,
no.	She	looked	younger	now.
Those	 clothes	 were	 more
appropriate	for	a	ten-year-old.
She	 scowled	 when	 she	 sawme	assessing	her.
“I	 wear	 this	 for	 Adora.
When	 I’m	 home,	 I’m	 her
little	doll.”
“And	when	you’re	not?”
“I’m	 other	 things.	 You’re
Camille.	 You’re	 my	 half
sister.	 Adora’s	 first	 daughter,
before	 Marian.	 You’re	 Pre
and	 I’m	 Post.	 You	 didn’t
recognize	me.”
“I’ve	been	away	too	long.
And	 Adora	 stopped	 sending
out	 Christmas	 photos	 fiveyears	ago.”
“Stopped	sending	them	to
you,	maybe.	We	still	take	the
dang	 pictures.	 Every	 year
Adora	 buys	 me	 a	 red-and-
green	 checked	 dress	 just	 for
the	 occasion.	 And	 as	 soon	 as
we’re	 done	 I	 throw	 it	 in	 the
fire.”
She	 plucked	 a	 footstool
the	 size	 of	 a	 tangerine	 from
the	 dollhouse’s	 front	 room
and	 held	 it	 up	 to	 me.	 “Needs
repolstering	 now.	 Adorachanged	 her	 color	 scheme
from	 peach	 to	 yellow.	 She
promised	me	she’d	take	me	to
the	fabric	store	so	I	can	make
new	coverings	to	match.	This
dollhouse	 is	 my	 fancy.”	 She
almost	made	it	sound	natural,
my	 fancy.	 The	 words	 floated
out	 of	 her	 mouth	 sweet	 and
round	 like	 butterscotch,
murmured	 with	 just	 a	 tilt	 of
her	 head,	 but	 the	 phrase	 was
definitely	 my	 mother’s.	 Her
little	 doll,	 learning	 to	 speakjust	like	Adora.
“Looks	like	you	do	a	very
good	 job	 with	 it,”	 I	 said,	 and
motioned	a	weak	wave	good-
bye.
“Thank	 you,”	 she	 said.
Her	eyes	focused	on	my	room
in	 the	 dollhouse.	 A	 small
finger	poked	the	bed.	“I	hope
you	 enjoy	 your	 stay	 here,”
she	 murmured	 into	 the	 room,
as	 if	 she	 were	 addressing	 a
tiny	 Camille	 no	 one	 could
see.	
I	 found	 Chief	 Vickery
banging	the	dent	out	of	a	stop
sign	 at	 the	 corner	 of	 Second
and	 Ely,	 a	 quiet	 street	 of
small	 houses	 a	 few	 blocks
from	 the	 police	 station.	 He
used	 a	 hammer,	 and	 with
each	 tinny	 bang	 he	 winced.
The	 back	 of	 his	 shirt	 was
already	 wet,	 and	 his	 bifocals
were	 slung	 down	 to	 the	 end
of	his	nose.
“I	 have	 nothing	 to	 say,Miss	Preaker.”	Bang.
“I	 know	 this	 is	 an	 easy
thing	 to	 resent,	 Chief
Vickery.	 I	 didn’t	 really	 even
want	 this	 assignment.	 I	 was
forced	 into	 it	 because	 I’m
from	here.”
“Haven’t	 been	 back	 in
years,	 from	 what	 I	 hear.”
Bang.
I	 didn’t	 say	 anything.	 I
looked	 at	 the	 crabgrass
splurting	 up	 through	 a	 crack
in	 the	 sidewalk.	 The	 Missstung	me	a	bit.	I	couldn’t	tell
if	 it	 was	 politeness	 I	 wasn’t
accustomed	to	or	a	jab	at	my
unmarried	 state.	 A	 single
woman	even	a	hair	over	thirty
was	 a	 queer	 thing	 in	 these
parts.
“A	 decent	 person	 would
have	 quit	 before	 writing
about	 dead	 children.”	 Bang.
“Opportunism,	
Miss
Preaker.”
Across	 the	 street,	 an
elderly	 man	 clutching	 acarton	 of	 milk	 was	 shuffling
half-steps	 toward	 a	 white
clapboard	house.
“I’m	not	feeling	so	decent
right	 now,	 you’re	 right.”	 I
didn’t	
mind	
gingering
Vickery	 along	 a	 little	 bit.	 I
wanted	 him	 to	 like	 me,	 not
just	 because	 it	 would	 make
my	job	easier,	but	because	his
bluster	 reminded	 me	 of
Curry,	 who	 I	 missed.	 “But	 a
little	 publicity	 might	 bring
some	 attention	 to	 this	 case,help	 get	 it	 solved.	 It’s
happened	before.”
“Goddam.”	 He	 threw	 the
hammer	 with	 a	 thud	 on	 the
ground	 and	 faced	 me.	 “We
already	 asked	 for	 help.	 Got
some	 special	 detective	 from
Kansas	 City	 down	 here,	 off
and	 on	 for	 months.	 And	 he
hasn’t	been	able	to	figure	out
one	 goddam	 thing.	 Says	 it
might	 be	 some	 crazed
hitchhiker	 dropped	 off	 the
road	 here,	 liked	 the	 looks	 ofthe	place,	and	stayed	for	near
on	 a	 year.	 Well	 this	 town
ain’t	 that	 big,	 and	 I	 sure	 as
hell	 haven’t	 seen	 anyone
looks	like	they	don’t	belong.”
He	glanced	pointedly	at	me.
“We’ve	 got	 some	 pretty
big	woods	around	here,	pretty
dense,”	I	suggested.
“This	isn’t	some	stranger,
and	 I	 would	 guess	 you	 know
it.”
“I	 would	 have	 thought
you’d	 prefer	 it	 to	 be	 astranger.”
Vickery	 sighed,	 lit	 a
cigarette,	put	his	hand	around
the	 sign	 post	 protectively.
“Hell,	of	course	I	would,”	he
said.	 “But	 I’m	 not	 too	 dumb
myself.	 Ain’t	 worked	 no
homicide	before,	but	I	ain’t	a
goddam	idiot.”
I	wished	then	that	I	hadn’t
sucked	down	so	much	vodka.
My	thoughts	were	vaporizing,
I	couldn’t	hold	on	to	what	he
was	 saying,	 couldn’t	 ask	 theright	questions.
“You	think	someone	from
Wind	Gap	is	doing	this?”
“No	comment.”
“Off	 record,	 why	 would
someone	from	Wind	Gap	kill
kids?”
“Got	 called	 out	 one	 time
because	 Ann	 had	 killed	 a
neighbor’s	 pet	 bird	 with	 a
stick.	 She’d	 sharpened	 it
herself	 with	 one	 of	 her
daddy’s	 hunting	 knifes.
Natalie,	 hell,	 her	 familymoved	 here	 two	 years	 ago
because	 she	 stabbed	 one	 of
her	classmates	in	the	eye	with
a	 pair	 of	 scissors	 back	 in
Philadelphia.	 Her	 daddy	 quit
his	 job	 at	 some	 big	 business,
just	 so	 they	 could	 start	 over.
In	 the	 state	 where	 his
granddad	grew	up.	In	a	small
town.	Like	a	small	town	don’t
come	 with	 its	 own	 set	 of
problems.”
“Not	the	least	of	which	is
everyone	knows	who	the	badseeds	are.”
“Damn	straight.”
“So	 you	 think	 this	 could
be	 someone	 who	 didn’t	 like
the	 children?	 These	 girls
specifically?	 Maybe	 they	 had
done	 something	 to	 him?	 And
this	was	revenge?”
Vickery	 pulled	 at	 the	 end
of	 his	 nose,	 scratched	 his
mustache.	 He	 looked	 back	 at
the	 hammer	 on	 the	 ground,
and	 I	 could	 tell	 he	 was
debating	whether	to	pick	it	upand	 dismiss	 me	 or	 keep
talking.	 Just	 then	 a	 black
sedan	 whooshed	 up	 next	 to
us,	
the	
passenger-side
window	 zipping	 down	 before
the	 car	 even	 stopped.	 The
driver’s	 face,	 blocked	 by
sunglasses,	peered	out	to	look
at	us.
“Hey,	 Bill.	 Thought	 we
were	 supposed	 to	 meet	 at
your	office	right	about	now.”
“Had	some	work	to	do.”
It	 was	 Kansas	 City.	 Helooked	 at	 me,	 lowering	 his
glasses	in	a	practiced	way.	He
had	a	flip	of	light	brown	hair
that	 kept	 dropping	 over	 his
left	 eye.	 Blue.	 He	 smiled	 at
me,	 teeth	 like	 perfect
Chiclets.
“Hi	 there.”	 He	 glanced	 at
Vickery,	 who	 pointedly	 bent
down	to	pick	up	the	hammer,
then	back	at	me.
“Hi,”	 I	 said.	 I	 pulled	 my
sleeves	down	over	my	hands,
balled	 the	 ends	 up	 in	 mypalms,	leaned	on	one	leg.
“Well,	 Bill,	 want	 a	 ride?
Or	are	you	a	walking	man—I
could	pick	us	up	some	coffee
and	meet	you	there.”
“Don’t	 drink	 coffee.
Something	 you	 should’ve
noticed	 by	 now.	 I’ll	 be	 there
in	fifteen	minutes.”
“See	 if	 you	 can	 make	 it
ten,	 huh?	 We’re	 already
running	 late.”	 Kansas	 City
looked	 at	 me	 one	 more	 time.
“Sure	 you	 don’t	 want	 a	 lift,Bill?”
Vickery	said	nothing,	just
shook	his	head.
“Who’s	your	friend,	Bill?
I	 thought	 I’d	 met	 all	 the
pertinent	 Wind	 Gappers
already.	 Or	 is	 it...Wind
Gapians?”	 He	 grinned.	 I
stood	 silent	 as	 a	 schoolgirl,
hoping	
Vickery	
would
introduce	me.
Bang!	 Vickery	 was
choosing	 not	 to	 hear.	 In
Chicago	I	would	have	jabbedmy	 hand	 out,	 announced
myself	 with	 a	 smile,	 and
enjoyed	 the	 reaction.	 Here	 I
stared	 at	 Vickery	 and	 stayed
mute.
“All	right	then,	see	you	at
the	station.”
The	 window	 zipped	 back
up,	the	car	pulled	away.
“Is	that	the	detective	from
Kansas	City?”	I	asked.
In	 answer,	 Vickery	 lit
another	 cigarette,	 walked	 off.
Across	the	street,	the	old	manhad	just	reached	his	top	step.	
Chapter	Four
Someone	 had	 spray-
painted	 blue	 curlicues	 on	 the
legs	 of	 the	 water	 tower	 at
Jacob	 J.	 Garrett	 Memorial
Park,	 and	 it	 was	 left	 looking
oddly	 dainty,	 as	 if	 it	 were
wearing	 crochet	 booties.	 The
park	 itself—the	 last	 place
Natalie	Keene	was	seen	alive
—was	 vacant.	 The	 dirt	 from
the	 baseball	 field	 hovered	 afew	 feet	 above	 the	 ground.	 I
could	 taste	 it	 in	 the	 back	 of
my	 throat	 like	 tea	 left
brewing	too	long.	The	grasses
grew	 tall	 at	 the	 edge	 of	 the
woods.	 I	 was	 surprised	 no
one	 had	 ordered	 them	 cut,
eradicated	like	the	stones	that
snagged	Ann	Nash.
When	 I	 was	 in	 high
school,	 Garrett	 Park	 was	 the
place	 everyone	 met	 on
weekends	 to	 drink	 beer	 or
smoke	 pot	 or	 get	 jerked	 offthree	 feet	 into	 the	 woods.	 It
was	 where	 I	 was	 first	 kissed,
at	 age	 thirteen,	 by	 a	 football
player	 with	 a	 pack	 of	 chaw
tucked	down	in	his	gums.	The
rush	 of	 the	 tobacco	 hit	 me
more	than	the	kiss;	behind	his
car	 I	 vomited	 wine	 cooler
with	 tiny,	 glowing	 slices	 of
fruit.
“James	Capisi	was	here.”
I	 turned	 around	 to	 face	 a
blond,	 buzz-cut	 boy	 of	 about
ten,	 holding	 a	 fuzzy	 tennisball.
“James	Capisi?”	I	asked.
“My	 friend,	 he	 was	 here
when	 she	 got	 Natalie,”	 the
kid	said.	“James	saw	her.	She
was	 wearing	 her	 nightgown.
They	 were	 playing	 Frisbee,
over	 by	 the	 woods,	 and	 she
took	 Natalie.	 It	 would’ve
been	James,	but	he	decided	to
stay	 here	 on	 the	 field.	 So
Natalie	 was	 the	 one	 right	 by
the	trees.	James	was	out	here
because	 of	 the	 sun.	 He’s	 notsupposed	 to	 be	 in	 the	 sun,
because	 his	 mom’s	 got	 skin
cancer,	 but	 he	 does	 anyway.
Or	he	did.”	The	boy	bounced
the	 tennis	 ball,	 and	 a	 puff	 of
dirt	floated	up	around	him.
“He	 doesn’t	 like	 the	 sun
anymore?”
“He	 doesn’t	 like	 nothing
no	more.”
“Because	of	Natalie?”
He	
shrugged
belligerently.
“Because	 James	 is	 apussy.”
The	kid	looked	me	up	and
down,	 then	 suddenly	 threw
the	ball	at	me,	hard.	It	hit	my
hip	and	bounced	off.
He	 blurted	 out	 a	 little
laugh.	“Sorry.”	He	scrambled
after	 the	 ball,	 dove	 on	 top	 of
it	 dramatically,	 then	 leapt	 up
and	 hurled	 it	 against	 the
ground.	 It	 bounced	 about	 ten
feet	 in	 the	 air,	 then	 dribbled
to	a	stop.
“I’m	
not	
sure	
Iunderstood	 what	 you	 said.
Who	 was	 wearing	 a
nightgown?”	 I	 kept	 my	 eye
on	the	bouncing	ball.
“The	 woman	 who	 took
Natalie.”
“Wait,	 what	 do	 you
mean?”	 The	 story	 I’d	 heard
was	 that	 Natalie	 had	 been
playing	here	with	friends	who
left	 to	 go	 home	 one	 by	 one,
and	 that	 she	 was	 assumed	 to
have	
been	
abducted
somewhere	 along	 her	 shortwalk	home.
“James	 saw	 the	 woman
take	 Natalie.	 It	 was	 just	 the
two	 of	 them,	 and	 they	 were
playing	 Frisbee,	 and	 Natalie
missed	 and	 it	 went	 into	 the
grasses	by	the	woods,	and	the
woman	 just	 reached	 out	 and
grabbed	 her.	 Then	 they	 were
gone.	 And	 James	 ran	 home.
And	 he	 don’t	 come	 out
since.”
“Then	 how	 do	 you	 know
what	happened?”“I	 visited	 him	 once.	 He
told	me.	I’m	his	buddy.”
“Does	 James	 live	 around
here?”
“Fuck	 him.	 I	 might	 go	 to
my	 grandma’s	 for	 the
summer	
anyway.	
In
Arkansas.	Better’n	here.”
The	 boy	 threw	 the	 ball	 at
the	chain-link	fence	outlining
the	 baseball	 diamond,	 and	 it
lodged	 there,	 rattling	 the
metal.
“You	 from	 here?”	 Hebegan	kicking	dirt	in	the	air.
“Yeah.	 I	 used	 to	 be.	 I
don’t	 live	 here	 anymore.	 I’m
visiting.”	I	tried	again:	“Does
James	live	around	here?”
“You	 in	 high	 school?”
His	 face	 was	 deeply	 tanned.
He	 looked	 like	 a	 baby
Marine.
“No.”
“College?”	 His	 chin	 was
wet	with	spit.
“Older.”
“I	 got	 to	 go.”	 He	 hoppedaway	 backward,	 yanked	 the
ball	 out	 of	 the	 fence	 like	 a
bad	 tooth,	 turned	 around	 and
looked	 at	 me	 again,	 waggled
his	hips	in	a	nervous	dance.	“I
got	 to	 go.”	 He	 threw	 the	 ball
toward	 the	 street,	 where	 it
bounced	 off	 my	 car	 with	 an
impressive	 thunk.	 He	 ran
after	it	and	was	gone.
I	looked	up	Capisi,	Janel,
in	 a	 magazine-thin	 phone
book	 at	 Wind	 Gap’s	 lone
FaStop.	 Then	 I	 filled	 a	 BigMouth	 with	 strawberry	 pop
and	drove	to	3617	Holmes.
The	 Capisi	 home	 sat	 on
the	 edge	 of	 the	 low-rent
section	to	the	far	east	of	town,
a	 cluster	 of	 broken-down,
two-bedroom	houses,	most	of
whose	inhabitants	work	at	the
nearby	 pig	 factory-farm,	 a
private	operation	that	delivers
almost	 2	 percent	 of	 the
country’s	 pork.	 Find	 a	 poor
person	 in	 Wind	 Gap,	 and
they’ll	almost	always	tell	youthey	work	at	the	farm,	and	so
did	 their	 old	 man.	 On	 the
breeding	 side,	 there	 are
piglets	 to	 be	 clipped	 and
crated,	
sows	
to	
be
impregnated	 and	 penned,
manure	 pits	 to	 be	 managed.
The	 killing	 side’s	 worse.
Some	 employees	 load	 the
pigs,	 forcing	 them	 down	 the
gangway,	 where	 stunners
await.	 Others	 grab	 the	 back
legs,	 fasten	 the	 catch	 around
them,	release	the	animal	to	belifted,	 squealing	 and	 kicking,
upside	 down.	 They	 cut	 the
throats	 with	 pointy	 slaughter
knives,	 the	 blood	 spattering
thick	 as	 paint	 onto	 the	 tile
floors.	 Then	 on	 to	 the
scalding	 tank.	 The	 constant
screams—frantic,	
metallic
squeals—drive	 most	 of	 the
workers	to	wear	earplugs,	and
they	 spend	 their	 days	 in	 a
soundless	 rage.	 At	 night	 they
drink	 and	 play	 music,	 loud.
The	 local	 bar,	 Heelah’s,serves	 nothing	 pork	 related,
only	 chicken	 tenders,	 which
are,	presumably,	processed	by
equally	 furious	 factory
workers	in	some	other	crappy
town.
For	 the	 sake	 of	 full
disclosure,	 I	 should	 add	 that
my	 mother	 owns	 the	 whole
operation	
and	
receives
approximately	$1.2	million	in
profits	 from	 it	 annually.	 She
lets	other	people	run	it.
A	tomcat	was	yowling	onthe	 Capisis’	 front	 porch,	 and
as	I	walked	toward	the	house,
I	 could	 hear	 the	 din	 of	 a
daytime	 talk	 show.	 I	 banged
on	 the	 screen	 door	 and
waited.	 The	 cat	 rubbed	 up
against	 my	 legs;	 I	 could	 feel
its	 ribs	 through	 my	 pants.	 I
banged	 again,	 and	 the	 TV
switched	 off.	 The	 cat	 stalked
under	 the	 porch	 swing	 and
cried.	 I	 traced	 the	 word	 yelp
on	 my	 right	 palm	 with	 a
fingernail	and	knocked	again.“Mom?”	 A	 child’s	 voice
at	the	open	window.
I	 walked	 over,	 and
through	the	dust	of	the	screen
could	see	a	thin	boy	with	dark
curls	and	gaping	eyes.
“Hi	 there,	 I’m	 sorry	 to
bug	you.	Are	you	James?”
“What	do	you	want?”
“Hi	 James,	 I’m	 sorry	 to
bother	 you.	 Were	 you
watching	something	good?”
“Are	you	the	police?”
“I’m	trying	to	help	figureout	who	hurt	your	friend.	Can
I	talk	to	you?”
He	 didn’t	 leave,	 just
traced	 a	 finger	 along	 the
window	ledge.	I	sat	down	on
the	swing	at	the	far	end	away
from	him.
“My	 name’s	 Camille.	 A
friend	 of	 yours	 told	 me	 what
you’d	 seen.	 A	 boy	 with	 real
short	blonde	hair?”
“Dee.”
“Is	 that	 his	 name?	 I	 saw
him	at	the	park,	the	same	parkwhere	you	were	playing	with
Natalie.”
“She	 took	 her.	 No	 one
believes	me.	I’m	not	scared.	I
just	need	to	stay	in	the	house
is	 all.	 My	 mom	 has	 cancer.
She’s	sick.”
“That’s	 what	 Dee	 said.	 I
don’t	 blame	 you.	 I	 hope	 I
didn’t	 scare	 you,	 coming	 by
like	 this.”	 He	 began	 scraping
an	 overlong	 fingernail	 down
the	 screen.	 The	 clicking
sound	made	my	ears	itch.“You	 don’t	 look	 like	 her.
If	you	looked	like	her,	I’d	call
the	police.	Or	I’d	shoot	you.”
“What	did	she	look	like?”
He	
shrugged	
his
shoulders.	 “I’ve	 said	 it
already.	A	hundred	times.”
“One	more	time.”
“She	was	old.”
“Old	like	me?”
“Old	like	a	mother.”
“What	else?”
“She	was	wearing	a	white
bed	dress	with	white	hair.	Shewas	just	all	white,	but	not	like
a	 ghost.	 That’s	 what	 I	 keep
saying.”
“White	like	how?”
“Just	 like	 she’d	 never
been	outside	before.”
“And	the	woman	grabbed
Natalie	 when	 she	 went
toward	the	woods?”	I	asked	it
in	the	same	coaxing	voice	my
mother	 used	 on	 favored
waitstaff.
“I’m	not	lying.”
“Of	 course	 not.	 Thewoman	grabbed	Natalie	while
y’all	were	playing?”
“Real	 fast,”	 he	 nodded.
“Natalie	 was	 walking	 in	 the
grass	to	find	the	Frisbee.	And
I	 saw	 the	 woman	 moving
from	 inside	 the	 woods,
watching	 her.	 I	 saw	 her
before	 Natalie	 did.	 But	 I
wasn’t	scared.”
“Probably	not.”
“Even	 when	 she	 grabbed
Natalie,	 at	 first	 I	 wasn’t
scared.”“But	then	you	were?”
“No.”	 His	 voice	 trailed
off.	“I	wasn’t.”
“James,	could	you	tell	me
what	 happened	 when	 she
grabbed	Natalie?”
“She	 pulled	 Natalie
against	 her,	 like	 she	 was
hugging	 her.	 And	 then	 she
looked	up	at	me.	She	stared	at
me.”
“The	woman	did?”
“Yeah.	She	smiled	at	me.
For	 a	 second	 I	 thought	 itmight	 be	 all	 right.	 But	 she
didn’t	say	anything.	And	then
she	 stopped	 smiling.	 She	 put
her	 finger	 to	 her	 lips	 to	 be
quiet.	And	then	she	was	gone
into	 the	 woods.	 With
Natalie.”	 He	 shrugged	 again.
“I’ve	 already	 told	 all	 this
before.”
“To	the	police?”
“First	 to	 my	 mom,	 then
the	 police.	 My	 mom	 made
me.	 But	 the	 police	 didn’t
care.”“Why	not?”
“They	 thought	 I	 was
lying.	 But	 I	 wouldn’t	 make
that	up.	It’s	stupid.”
“Did	 Natalie	 do	 anything
while	this	was	happening?”
“No.	She	just	stood	there.
I	 don’t	 think	 she	 knew	 what
to	do.”
“Did	the	woman	look	like
anyone	you’d	seen	before?”
“No.	 I	 told	 you.”	 He
stepped	away	from	the	screen
then,	 began	 looking	 over	 hisshoulder	into	the	living	room.
“Well,	I’m	sorry	to	bother
you.	 Maybe	 you	 should	 have
a	 friend	 come	 by.	 Keep	 you
company.”	 He	 shrugged
again,	chewed	on	a	fingernail.
“You	might	feel	better	if	you
get	outside.”
“I	don’t	want	to.	Anyway,
we	 have	 a	 gun.”	 He	 pointed
back	 over	 his	 shoulder	 at	 a
pistol	balanced	on	the	arm	of
a	 couch,	 next	 to	 a	 half-eaten
ham	sandwich.	Jesus.“You	 sure	 you	 should
have	 that	 out,	 James?	 You
don’t	 want	 to	 use	 that.	 Guns
are	very	dangerous.”
“Not	 so	 dangerous.	 My
mom	 doesn’t	 care.”	 He
looked	 at	 me	 straight	 on	 for
the	first	time.	“You’re	pretty.
You	have	pretty	hair.”
“Thank	you.”
“I’ve	got	to	go.”
“Okay.	
Be	
careful,
James.”
“That’s	 what	 I’m	 doing.”He	 sighed	 purposefully	 and
walked	 away	 from	 the
window.	 A	 second	 later	 I
heard	 the	 TV	 squabble	 on
again.
	
There	 are	 eleven	 bars	 in
Wind	 Gap.	 I	 went	 to	 one	 I
didn’t	 know,	 Sensors,	 which
must	 have	 blossomed	 during
some	 flash	 of	 ’80s	 idiocy,
judging	 by	 the	 neon	 zigzags
on	 the	 wall	 and	 the	 mini
dance	floor	in	its	center.	I	wasdrinking	 a	 bourbon	 and
scribbling	 down	 my	 notes
from	 the	 day	 when	 KC	 Law
plopped	 down	 in	 the
cushioned	 seat	 opposite	 me.
He	 rattled	 his	 beer	 on	 the
table	between	us.
“I	 thought	 reporters
weren’t	 supposed	 to	 talk	 to
minors	 without	 permission.”
He	 smiled,	 took	 a	 gulp.
James’s	 mother	 must	 have
made	a	phone	call.
“Reporters	 have	 to	 bemore	 aggressive	 when	 the
police	 completely	 shut	 them
out	 of	 an	 investigation,”	 I
said,	not	looking	up.
“Police	 can’t	 really	 do
their	 work	 if	 reporters	 are
detailing	 their	 investigations
in	Chicago	papers.”
This	game	was	old.	I	went
back	to	my	notes,	soggy	from
glass	sweat.
“Let’s	 try	 a	 new
approach.	
I’m	
Richard
Willis.”	 He	 took	 anothergulp,	 smacked	 his	 lips.	 “You
can	make	your	dick	joke	now.
It	works	on	several	levels.”
“Tempting.”
“Dick	 as	 in	 asshole.	 Dick
as	in	cop.”
“Yes,	I	got	it.”
“And	 you	 are	 Camille
Preaker,	Wind	Gap	girl	made
good	in	the	big	city.”
“Oh,	that’s	me	all	right.”
He	 smiled	 his	 alarming
Chiclet	 smile	 and	 ran	 a	 hand
through	his	hair.	No	weddingring.	 I	 wondered	 when	 I
began	to	notice	such	things.
“Okay,	 Camille,	 what	 do
you	 say	 you	 and	 I	 call	 a
détente?	At	least	for	now.	See
how	it	goes.	I	assume	I	don’t
need	to	lecture	you	about	the
Capisi	boy.”
“I	 assume	 you	 realize
there’s	 nothing	 to	 lecture
about.	 Why	 have	 the	 police
dismissed	 the	 account	 of	 the
one	 eyewitness	 to	 the
kidnapping	
of	
NatalieKeene?”	 I	 picked	 up	 my	 pen
to	 show	 him	 we	 were	 on
record.
“Who	 says	 we	 dismissed
it?”
“James	Capisi.”
“Ah,	 well,	 there’s	 a	 good
source.”	 He	 laughed.	 “I’ll	 let
you	 in	 on	 a	 little	 something
here,	 Miss	 Preaker.”	 He	 was
doing	 a	 fairly	 good	 Vickery
imitation,	 right	 down	 to
twisting	 an	 imaginary	 pinky
ring.	“We	don’t	let	nine-year-old	boys	be	particularly	privy
to	 an	 ongoing	 investigation
one	way	or	another.	Including
whether	or	not	we	believe	his
story.”
“Do	you?”
“I	can’t	comment.”
“It	seems	that	if	you	had	a
fairly	detailed	description	of	a
murder	 suspect,	 you	 might
want	 to	 let	 people	 around
here	know,	so	they	can	be	on
the	lookout.	But	you	haven’t,
so	 I’d	 have	 to	 guess	 you’ddismissed	his	story.”
“Again,	
I	
can’t
comment.”
“I	 understand	 Ann	 Nash
was	not	sexually	molested,”	I
continued.	 “Is	 that	 also	 the
case	with	Natalie	Keene?”
“Ms.	 Preaker.	 I	 just	 can’t
comment	right	now.”
“Then	why	are	you	sitting
here	talking	to	me?”
“Well,	first	of	all,	I	know
you	 spent	 a	 lot	 of	 your	 time,
probably	work	time,	with	ourofficer	 the	 other	 day,	 giving
him	 your	 version	 of	 the
discovery	of	Natalie’s	body.	I
wanted	to	thank	you.”
“My	version?”
“Everyone	 has	 their	 own
version	 of	 a	 memory,”	 he
said.	 “For	 instance,	 you	 said
Natalie’s	eyes	were	open.	The
Broussards	 said	 they	 were
closed.”
“I	 can’t	 comment.”	 I	 was
feeling	spiteful.
“I’m	inclined	to	believe	awoman	who	makes	her	living
as	a	reporter	over	two	elderly
diner	 owners,”	 Willis	 said.
“But	 I’d	 like	 to	 hear	 how
positive	you	are.”
“Was	 Natalie	 sexually
molested?	 Off	 the	 record.”	 I
set	down	my	pen.
He	sat	silent	for	a	second,
twirling	his	beer	bottle.
“No.”
“I’m	 positive	 her	 eyes
were	 open.	 But	 you	 were
there.”“I	was,”	he	said.
“So	 you	 don’t	 need	 me
for	 that.	 What’s	 the	 second
thing?”
“What?”
“You	said,	‘first	of	all...’”
“Oh,	 right.	 Well,	 the
second	 reason	 I	 wanted	 to
speak	with	you,	to	be	frank—
a	 quality	 it	 seems	 you’d
appreciate—is	 that	 I’m
desperate	 to	 talk	 to	 a
nontownie.”	The	teeth	flashed
at	me.	“I	mean,	I	know	you’refrom	 here.	 And	 I	 don’t	 know
how	you	did	it.	I’ve	been	here
off	 and	 on	 since	 last	 August
and	I’m	going	crazy.	Not	that
Kansas	 City	 is	 a	 seething
metropolis,	but	there’s	a	night
life.	
A	
cultural...some
culture.	There’s	people.”
“I’m	 sure	 you’re	 doing
fine.”
“I’d	better.	I	may	be	here
for	a	while	now.”
“Yes.”	 I	 pointed	 my
notebook	 at	 him.	 “So	 what’syour	theory,	Mr.	Willis?”
“That’s	 Detective	 Willis,
actually.”	He	grinned	again.	I
finished	 my	 drink	 in	 another
swallow,	 began	 chewing	 on
the	 stunted	 cocktail	 straw.
“So,	Camille,	can	I	buy	you	a
round?”
I	 jiggled	 my	 glass	 and
nodded.	 “Bourbon	 straight
up.”
“Nice.”
While	he	was	at	the	bar,	I
took	 my	 ballpoint	 and	 wrotethe	word	 dick	on	my	wrist	in
looping	 cursive.	 He	 came
back	with	two	Wild	Turkeys.
“So.”	 He	 wiggled	 his
eyebrows	 at	 me.	 “My
proposal	is	that	maybe	we	can
just	 talk	 for	 a	 little	 bit.	 Like
civilians?	 I’m	 really	 craving
it.	 Bill	 Vickery	 isn’t	 exactly
dying	to	get	to	know	me.”
“That	makes	two	of	us.”
“Right.	 So,	 you’re	 from
Wind	 Gap,	 and	 now	 you
work	 for	 a	 paper	 in	 Chicago.Tribune?”
“Daily	Post.”
“Don’t	know	that	one.”
“You	wouldn’t.”
“That	high	on	it,	huh?”
“It’s	fine.	It’s	just	fine.”	I
wasn’t	 in	 the	 mood	 to	 be
charming,	 not	 even	 sure	 I’d
remember	 the	 drill.	 Adora	 is
the	 schmoozer	 in	 the	 family
—even	 the	 guy	 who	 sprays
for	termites	once	a	year	sends
doting	Christmas	cards.
“You’re	 not	 giving	 me	 alot	 to	 work	 with	 here,
Camille.	 If	 you	 want	 me	 to
leave,	I	will.”
I	 didn’t,	 in	 truth.	 He	 was
nice	to	look	at,	and	his	voice
made	 me	 feel	 less	 ragged.	 It
didn’t	 hurt	 that	 he	 didn’t
belong	here	either.
“I’m	 sorry,	 I’m	 being
curt.	 Been	 a	 rocky	 reentry.
Writing	about	all	this	doesn’t
help.”
“How	 long	 since	 you’ve
been	back?”“Years.	 Eight	 to	 be
precise.”
“But	you	still	have	family
here.”
“Oh,	 yes.	 Fervent	 Wind
Gapians.	 I	 think	 that’s	 the
preferred	 term,	 in	 answer	 to
your	question	earlier	today.”
“Ah,	 thanks.	 I’d	 hate	 to
insult	 the	 nice	 people	 around
here.	 More	 than	 I	 already
have.	 So	 your	 folks	 like	 it
here?”
“Mm-hmm.	They’d	neverdream	 of	 leaving	 here.	 Too
many	 friends.	 Too	 perfect	 a
house.	Etcetera.”
“Both	 your	 parents	 were
born	here	then?”
A	 table	 of	 familiar	 guys
about	 my	 age	 plopped	 down
at	 a	 nearby	 booth,	 each
sloshing	 a	 pitcher	 of	 beer.	 I
hoped	they	wouldn’t	see	me.
“My	 mom	 was.	 My
stepdad’s	from	Tennessee.	He
moved	 here	 when	 they	 got
married.”“When	was	that?”
“Almost	 thirty	 years	 ago,
I’d	guess.”	I	tried	to	slow	my
drinking	 down	 so	 I	 didn’t
outpace	him.
“And	your	father?”
I	 smiled	 pointedly.	 “You
raised	in	Kansas	City?”
“Yep.	 Never	 dream	 of
leaving.	 Too	 many	 friends.
Too	 perfect	 a	 house.
Etcetera.”
“And	 being	 a	 cop	 there
is...good?”“You	 see	 some	 action.
Enough	 so	 I	 won’t	 turn	 into
Vickery.	Last	year	I	did	some
high-profile	 stuff.	 Murders
mostly.	 And	 we	 got	 a	 guy
who	 was	 serially	 assaulting
women	around	town.”
“Rape?”
“No.	 He	 straddled	 them
and	 then	 reached	 inside	 their
mouths,	 scratched	 their
throats	to	pieces.”
“Jesus.”
“We	 caught	 him.	 He	 wasa	
middle-aged	
liquor
salesman	 who	 lived	 with	 his
mother,	 and	 still	 had	 tissue
from	 the	 last	 woman’s	 throat
under	 his	 fingernails.	 Ten
days	after	the	attack.”
I	 wasn’t	 clear	 if	 he	 was
bemoaning	
the	
guy’s
stupidity	or	his	poor	hygiene.
“Good.”
“And	 now	 I’m	 here.
Smaller	 town,	 but	 bigger
proving	 grounds.	 When
Vickery	 first	 phoned	 us,	 thecase	 wasn’t	 that	 big	 yet,	 so
they	 sent	 someone	 mid-range
on	 the	 totem	 pole.	 Me.”	 He
smiled,	
almost	
self-
effacingly.	 “Then	 it	 turned
into	 a	 serial.	 They’re	 letting
me	 keep	 the	 case	 for	 now—
with	 the	 understanding	 that
I’d	better	not	screw	up.”
His	 situation	 sounded
familiar.
“It’s	 strange	 to	 get	 your
big	break	based	on	something
so	 horrible,”	 he	 continued.“But	 you	 must	 know	 about
that—what	kind	of	stories	do
you	cover	in	Chicago?”
“I’m	 on	 the	 police	 beat,
so	probably	the	same	kind	of
junk	 you	 see:	 abuse,	 rape,
murder.”	 I	 wanted	 him	 to
know	 I	 had	 horror	 stories,
too.	 Foolish,	 but	 I	 indulged.
“Last	month	it	was	an	eighty-
two-year-old	 man.	 Son	 killed
him,	 then	 left	 him	 in	 a
bathtub	 of	 Drano	 to	 dissolve.
Guy	 confessed,	 but,	 ofcourse,	 couldn’t	 come	 up
with	a	reason	for	doing	it.”
I	was	regretting	using	the
word	 junk	 to	 describe	 abuse,
rape,	
and	
murder.
Disrespectful.
“Sounds	 like	 we’ve	 both
seen	 some	 ugly	 things,”
Richard	said.
“Yes.”	I	twirled	my	drink,
had	nothing	to	say.
“I’m	sorry.”
“Me	too.”
He	 studied	 me.	 Thebartender	 switched	 the	 house
lights	 to	 low,	 an	 official
signal	of	nighttime	hours.
“We	 could	 catch	 a	 movie
sometime.”	 He	 said	 it	 in	 a
conciliatory	 tone,	 as	 if	 an
evening	 at	 the	 local	 cineplex
might	 make	 everything	 work
out	for	me.
“Maybe.”	I	swallowed	the
rest	of	my	drink.	“Maybe.”
He	peeled	the	label	off	the
empty	beer	bottle	next	to	him
and	 smoothed	 it	 out	 onto	 thetable.	 Messy.	 A	 sure	 sign
he’d	never	worked	in	a	bar.
“Well,	Richard,	thank	you
for	 the	 drink.	 I’ve	 got	 to	 get
home.”
“It	 was	 nice	 talking	 with
you,	Camille.	Can	I	walk	you
to	your	car?”
“No,	I’m	fine.”
“You	 okay	 to	 drive?	 I
promise,	 I’m	 not	 being	 a
cop.”
“I’m	fine.”
“Okay.	
Have	
gooddreams.”
“You	 too.	 Next	 time,	 I
want	something	on	record.”
	
Alan,	 Adora,	 and	 Amma
were	all	gathered	in	the	living
room	 when	 I	 returned.	 The
scene	 was	 startling,	 it	 was	 so
much	 like	 the	 old	 days	 with
Marian.	 Amma	 and	 my
mother	 sat	 on	 the	 couch,	 my
mother	cradling	Amma—in	a
woolen	nightgown	despite	the
heat—as	she	held	an	ice	cubeto	 her	 lips.	 My	 half	 sister
stared	 up	 at	 me	 with	 blank
contentment,	 then	 went	 back
to	 playing	 with	 a	 glowing
mahogany	 dinner	 table,
exactly	 like	 the	 one	 in	 the
next	 room,	 except	 that	 it	 was
about	four	inches	high.
“Nothing	to	worry	about,”
Alan	 said,	 looking	 up	 from	 a
newspaper.	“Amma’s	just	got
the	summer	chills.”
I	felt	a	shot	of	alarm,	then
annoyance:	 I	 was	 sinkingback	 into	 old	 routines,	 about
to	 run	 to	 the	 kitchen	 to	 heat
some	 tea,	 just	 like	 I	 always
did	for	Marian	when	she	was
sick.	 I	 was	 about	 to	 linger
near	 my	 mother,	 waiting	 for
her	to	put	an	arm	around	me,
too.	 My	 mother	 and	 Amma
said	 nothing.	 My	 mother
didn’t	 even	 look	 up	 at	 me,
just	 nuzzled	 Amma	 in	 closer
to	her,	and	cooed	into	her	ear.
“We	 Crellins	 run	 a	 bit
delicate,”	
Alan	
saidsomewhat	 guiltily.	 The
doctors	in	Woodberry,	in	fact,
probably	 saw	 a	 Crellin	 a
week—both	 my	 mother	 and
Alan	
were	
sincere
overreactors	 when	 it	 came	 to
their	 health.	 When	 I	 was	 a
child,	I	remember	my	mother
trying	 to	 prod	 me	 with
ointments	
and	
oils,
homemade	 remedies	 and
homeopathic	 nonsense.	 I
sometimes	 took	 the	 foul
solutions,	more	often	refused.Then	 Marian	 got	 sick,	 really
sick,	 and	 Adora	 had	 more
important	 things	 to	 do	 than
coaxing	 me	 into	 swallowing
wheat-germ	 extract.	 Now	 I
had	 a	 pang:	 all	 those	 syrups
and	tablets	she	proffered,	and
I	 rejected.	 That	 was	 the	 last
time	I	had	her	full	attention	as
a	 mother.	 I	 suddenly	 wished
I’d	been	easier.
The	 Crellins.	 Everyone
here	 was	 a	 Crellin	 but	 me,	 I
thought	childishly.“I’m	 sorry	 you’re	 sick,
Amma,”	I	said.
“The	pattern	on	the	legs	is
wrong,”	 Amma	 whined
abruptly.	 She	 held	 the	 table
up	to	my	mother,	indignant.
“You’ve	 got	 such	 eyes,
Amma,”	
Adora	
said,
squinting	 at	 the	 miniature.
“But	 it’s	 barely	 noticeable,
baby.	 Only	 you	 will	 ever
know.”	 She	 smoothed	 back
Amma’s	damp	hairline.
“I	 can’t	 have	 it	 wrong,”Amma	said,	glaring	at	it.	“We
have	 to	 send	 it	 back.	 What’s
the	point	of	getting	it	special-
made	if	it’s	not	right?”
“Darling,	 I	 promise	 you,
you	 can’t	 even	 tell.”	 My
mother	patted	Amma’s	cheek,
but	 she	 was	 already	 standing
up.
“You	 said	 it	 would	 all	 be
perfect.	 You	 promised!”	 Her
voice	 wavered	 and	 tears
started	 dripping	 down	 her
face.	 “Now	 it’s	 ruined.	 Thewhole	thing	is	ruined.	It’s	the
dining	 room—it	 can’t	 have	 a
table	 that	 doesn’t	 match.	 I
hate	it!”
“Amma...”	 Alan	 folded
his	paper	and	went	to	put	his
arms	 around	 her,	 but	 she
wrenched	away.
“This	is	all	I	want,	it’s	all
I	 asked	 for,	 and	 you	 don’t
even	 care	 that	 it’s	 wrong!”
she	 was	 screaming	 through
her	 tears	 now,	 a	 full-blown
tantrum,	 her	 face	 mottled	 inanger.
“Amma,	 calm	 yourself,”
Alan	said	coolly,	trying	to	get
a	hold	of	her	again.
“It’s	 all	 I	 want!”	 Amma
yelped,	and	smashed	the	table
on	the	floor,	where	it	cracked
into	 five	 shards.	 She	 hit	 it
until	 it	 was	 in	 pieces,	 then
buried	 her	 face	 in	 the	 sofa
cushion	and	wailed.
“Well,”	 my	 mother	 said.
“Looks	like	we’ll	have	to	get
a	new	one	now.”I	 retreated	 to	 my	 room,
away	 from	 that	 horrible	 little
girl,	who	was	not	like	Marian
at	 all.	 My	 body	 was	 heading
into	a	flare.	I	paced	a	bit,	tried
to	 remember	 how	 to	 breathe
right,	 how	 to	 calm	 my	 skin.
But	 it	 blared	 at	 me.
Sometimes	 my	 scars	 have	 a
mind	of	their	own.
	
I	 am	 a	 cutter,	 you	 see.
Also	 a	 snipper,	 a	 slicer,	 a
carver,	 a	 jabber.	 I	 am	 a	 veryspecial	case.	I	have	a	purpose.
My	 skin,	 you	 see,	 screams.
It’s	 covered	 with	 words
—cook,	 cupcake,	 kitty,	 curls
—as	if	a	knife-wielding	first-
grader	learned	to	write	on	my
flesh.	 I	 sometimes,	 but	 only
sometimes,	laugh.	Getting	out
of	the	bath	and	seeing,	out	of
the	 corner	 of	 my	 eye,	 down
the	 side	 of	 a	 leg:	 baby-doll.
Pulling	on	a	sweater	and,	in	a
flash	 of	 my	 wrist:	 harmful.
Why	these	words?	Thousandsof	 hours	 of	 therapy	 have
yielded	 a	 few	 ideas	 from	 the
good	 doctors.	 They	 are	 often
feminine,	in	a	Dick	and	Jane,
pink	 vs.	 puppy	 dog	 tails	 sort
of	 way.	 Or	 they’re	 flat-out
negative.	
Number	
of
synonyms	 for	 anxious	 carved
in	 my	 skin:	 eleven.	 The	 one
thing	I	know	for	sure	is	that	at
the	time,	it	was	crucial	to	see
these	 letters	 on	 me,	 and	 not
just	 see	 them,	 but	 feel	 them.
Burning	 on	 my	 left	 hip:petticoat.
And	 near	 it,	 my	 first
word,	 slashed	 on	 an	 anxious
summer	 day	 at	 age	 thirteen:
wicked.	 I	 woke	 up	 that
morning,	 hot	 and	 bored,
worried	 about	 the	 hours
ahead.	How	do	you	keep	safe
when	 your	 whole	 day	 is	 as
wide	 and	 empty	 as	 the	 sky?
Anything	 could	 happen.	 I
remember	 feeling	 that	 word,
heavy	 and	 slightly	 sticky
across	 my	 pubic	 bone.	 Mymother’s	 steak	 knife.	 Cutting
like	 a	 child	 along	 red
imaginary	 lines.	 Cleaning
myself.	 Digging	 in	 deeper.
Cleaning	 myself.	 Pouring
bleach	 over	 the	 knife	 and
sneaking	 through	 the	 kitchen
to	 return	 it.	 Wicked.	 Relief.
The	 rest	 of	 the	 day,	 I	 spent
ministering	to	my	wound.	Dig
into	 the	 curves	 of	 W	 with	 an
alcohol-soaked	 Q-tip.	 Pet	 my
cheek	 until	 the	 sting	 went
away.	 Lotion.	 Bandage.Repeat.
The	 problem	 started	 long
before	 that,	 of	 course.
Problems	 always	 start	 long
before	 you	 really,	 really	 see
them.	I	was	nine	and	copying,
with	 a	 thick	 polka-dotted
pencil,	the	entire	Little	House
on	the	Prairie	series	word	by
word	 into	 spiral	 notebooks
with	glowing	green	covers.
I	 was	 ten	 and	 writing
every	 other	 word	 my	 teacher
said	 on	 my	 jeans	 in	 blueballpoint.	 I	 washed	 them,
guiltily,	 secretly,	 in	 my
bathroom	 sink	 with	 baby
shampoo.	
The	
words
smudged	 and	 blurred,	 left
indigo	 hieroglyphics	 up	 and
down	 the	 pant	 legs,	 as	 if	 a
tiny	 ink-stained	 bird	 had
hopped	across	them.
By	 eleven,	 I	 was
compulsively	 writing	 down
everything	anyone	said	to	me
in	a	tiny	blue	notepad,	a	mini
reporter	 already.	 Everyphrase	 had	 to	 be	 captured	 on
paper	 or	 it	 wasn’t	 real,	 it
slipped	 away.	 I’d	 see	 the
words	 hanging	 in	 midair—
Camille,	 pass	 the	 milk—and
anxiety	 coiled	 up	 in	 me	 as
they	 began	 to	 fade,	 like	 jet
exhaust.	 Writing	 them	 down,
though,	 I	 had	 them.	 No
worries	 that	 they’d	 become
extinct.	 I	 was	 a	 lingual
conservationist.	 I	 was	 the
class	 freak,	 a	 tight,	 nervous
eighth-grader	
frenziedlycopying	 down	 phrases	 (“Mr.
Feeney	is	totally	gay,”	“Jamie
Dobson	is	ugly,”	“They	never
have	 chocolate	 milk”)	 with	 a
keenness	 bordering	 on	 the
religious.
Marian	 died	 on	 my
thirteenth	 birthday.	 I	 woke
up,	 padded	 down	 the	 hall	 to
say	 hello—always	 the	 first
thing	 I	 did—and	 found	 her,
eyes	 open,	 blanket	 pulled	 up
to	 her	 chin.	 I	 remember	 not
being	 that	 surprised.	 She’dbeen	 dying	 for	 as	 long	 as	 I
could	remember.
That	summer,	other	things
happened.	 I	 became	 quite
suddenly,	
unmistakably
beautiful.	It	could	have	fallen
either	 way.	 Marian	 was	 the
confirmed	 beauty:	 big	 blue
eyes,	tiny	nose,	perfect	pointy
chin.	My	features	changed	by
the	 day,	 as	 if	 clouds	 floated
above	me	casting	flattering	or
sickly	 shadows	 on	 my	 face.
But	 once	 it	 was	 settled—andwe	 all	 seemed	 to	 realize	 it
that	 summer,	 the	 same
summer	 I	 first	 found	 blood
speckling	my	thighs,	the	same
summer	
I	
began
compulsively,	
furiously
masturbating—I	 was	 hooked.
I	 was	 taken	 with	 myself,	 an
incredible	flirt	in	any	mirror	I
could	 find.	 Unabashed	 as	 a
colt.	 And	 people	 loved	 me.	 I
was	 no	 longer	 the	 pity	 case
(with,	 how	 weird,	 the	 dead
sister).	 I	 was	 the	 pretty	 girl(with,	 how	 sad,	 the	 dead
sister).	And	so	I	was	popular.
It	 was	 that	 summer,	 too,
that	 I	 began	 the	 cutting,	 and
was	almost	as	devoted	to	it	as
to	 my	 newfound	 loveliness.	 I
adored	 tending	 to	 myself,
wiping	 a	 shallow	 red	 pool	 of
my	 blood	 away	 with	 a	 damp
washcloth	 to	 magically
reveal,	 just	 above	 my	 naval:
queasy.	 Applying	 alcohol
with	 dabs	 of	 a	 cottonball,
wispy	 shreds	 sticking	 to	 thebloody	lines	of:	perky.	I	had	a
dirty	 streak	 my	 senior	 year,
which	I	later	rectified.	A	few
quick	 cuts	 and	 cunt	 becomes
can’t,	 cock	 turns	 into	 back,
clit	 transforms	 to	 a	 very
unlikely	cat,	the	l	and	i	turned
into	a	teetering	capital	A.
The	 last	 word	 I	 ever
carved	 into	 myself,	 sixteen
years	after	I	started:	vanish.
Sometimes	 I	 can	 hear	 the
words	 squabbling	 at	 each
other	across	my	body.	Up	onmy	 shoulder,	 panty	 calling
down	 to	 cherry	 on	 the	 inside
of	 my	 right	 ankle.	 On	 the
underside	 of	 a	 big	 toe,	 sew
uttering	 muffled	 threats	 to
baby,	 just	 under	 my	 left
breast.	I	can	quiet	them	down
by	thinking	of	vanish,	always
hushed	 and	 regal,	 lording
over	the	other	words	from	the
safety	of	the	nape	of	my	neck.
Also:	At	the	center	of	my
back,	 which	 was	 too	 difficult
to	reach,	is	a	circle	of	perfectskin	the	size	of	a	fist.
Over	 the	 years	 I’ve	 made
my	 own	 private	 jokes.	 You
can	 really	 read	 me.	 Do	 you
want	 me	 to	 spell	 it	 out	 for
you?	 I’ve	 certainly	 given
myself	a	life	sentence.	Funny,
right?	I	can’t	stand	to	look	at
myself	
without	
being
completely	covered.	Someday
I	 may	 visit	 a	 surgeon,	 see
what	 can	 be	 done	 to	 smooth
me,	 but	 now	 I	 couldn’t	 bear
the	 reaction.	 Instead	 I	 drinkso	 I	 don’t	 think	 too	 much
about	 what	 I’ve	 done	 to	 my
body	 and	 so	 I	 don’t	 do	 any
more.	 Yet	 most	 of	 the	 time
that	I’m	awake,	I	want	to	cut.
Not	 small	 words	 either.
Equivocate.	
Inarticulate.
Duplicitous.	 At	 my	 hospital
back	 in	 Illinois	 they	 would
not	approve	of	this	craving.
For	 those	 who	 need	 a
name,	there’s	a	gift	basket	of
medical	 terms.	 All	 I	 know	 is
that	the	cutting	made	me	feelsafe.	 It	 was	 proof.	 Thoughts
and	 words,	 captured	 where	 I
could	 see	 them	 and	 track
them.	 The	 truth,	 stinging,	 on
my	 skin,	 in	 a	 freakish
shorthand.	 Tell	 me	 you’re
going	 to	 the	 doctor,	 and	 I’ll
want	to	cut	worrisome	on	my
arm.	 Say	 you’ve	 fallen	 in
love	 and	 I	 buzz	 the	 outlines
of	 tragic	 over	 my	 breast.	 I
hadn’t	 necessarily	 wanted	 to
be	 cured.	 But	 I	 was	 out	 of
places	to	write,	slicing	myselfbetween	my	toes—bad,	cry—
like	 a	 junkie	 looking	 for	 one
last	 vein.	 Vanish	 did	 it	 for
me.	I’d	saved	the	neck,	such	a
nice	prime	spot,	for	one	final
good	 cutting.	 Then	 I	 turned
myself	 in.	 I	 stayed	 at	 the
hospital	 twelve	 weeks.	 It’s	 a
special	 place	 for	 people	 who
cut,	 almost	 all	 of	 them
women,	 most	 under	 twenty-
five.	I	went	when	I	was	thirty.
Just	 six	 months	 out.	 Delicate
times.Curry	 came	 to	 visit	 once,
brought	 yellow	 roses.	 They
chiseled	 off	 all	 the	 thorns
before	 he	 was	 allowed	 into
the	reception	room,	deposited
the	 shards	 in	 plastic
containers—Curry	 said	 they
looked	 like	 prescription
bottles—which	 they	 locked
away	 until	 the	 trash	 pickup
came.	We	sat	in	the	dayroom,
all	 rounded	 edges	 and	 plush
couches,	 and	 as	 we	 talked
about	 the	 paper	 and	 his	 wifeand	 the	 latest	 news	 in
Chicago,	 I	 scanned	 his	 body
for	 anything	 sharp.	 A	 belt
buckle,	 a	 safety	 pin,	 a	 watch
fob.
“I’m	 so	 sorry,	 my	 girl,”
he	said	at	the	end	of	his	visit,
and	 I	 could	 tell	 he	 meant	 it
because	 his	 voice	 sounded
wet.
When	he	left	I	was	so	sick
with	 myself	 I	 vomited	 in	 the
bathroom,	 and	 as	 I	 was
vomiting,	 I	 noticed	 therubber-covered	 screws	 at	 the
back	 of	 the	 toilet.	 I	 pried	 the
cap	 off	 one	 and	 sanded	 the
palm	 of	 my	 hand—I—until
orderlies	 hauled	 me	 out,
blood	 splurting	 from	 the
wound	like	stigmata.
My	 roommate	 killed
herself	 later	 that	 week.	 Not
by	 cutting,	 which	 was,	 of
course,	 the	 irony.	 She
swallowed	a	bottle	of	Windex
a	 janitor	 left	 out.	 She	 was
sixteen,	 a	 former	 cheerleaderwho	 cut	 herself	 above	 the
thigh	so	no	one	would	notice.
Her	 parents	 glared	 at	 me
when	 they	 came	 to	 pick	 up
her	things.
They	
always	
call
depression	 the	 blues,	 but	 I
would	 have	 been	 happy	 to
waken	 to	 a	 periwinkle
outlook.	 Depression	 to	 me	 is
urine	 yellow.	 Washed	 out,
exhausted	miles	of	weak	piss.
The	 nurses	 gave	 us	 meds
to	alleviate	our	tingling	skins.And	more	meds	to	soothe	our
burning	 brains.	 We	 were
body	 searched	 twice	 weekly
for	any	sharp	objects,	and	sat
in	 groups	 together	 purging
ourselves,	 theoretically,	 of
anger	 and	 self-hatred.	 We
learned	 not	 to	 turn	 on
ourselves.	 We	 learned	 to
blame.	After	a	month	of	good
behavior,	 we	 earned	 silky
baths	and	massages.	We	were
taught	the	goodness	of	touch.
My	only	other	visitor	wasmy	mother,	who	I	hadn’t	seen
in	half	a	decade.	She	smelled
of	 purple	 flowers	 and	 wore	 a
jangling	 charm	 bracelet	 I
coveted	 as	 a	 child.	 When	 we
were	 alone,	 she	 talked	 about
the	 foliage	 and	 some	 new
town	 rule	 that	 required
Christmas	 lights	 be	 taken
down	 by	 January	 15.	 When
my	 doctors	 joined	 us,	 she
cried	and	petted	and	fretted	at
me.	 She	 stroked	 my	 hair	 and
wondered	why	I	had	done	thisto	myself.
Then,	 inevitably,	 came
the	 stories	 of	 Marian.	 She’d
already	 lost	 one	 child,	 you
see.	 It	 had	 nearly	 killed	 her.
Why	would	the	older	(though
necessarily	 less	 beloved)
deliberately	 harm	 herself?	 I
was	so	different	from	her	lost
girl,	who—think	of	it—would
be	almost	thirty	had	she	lived.
Marian	 embraced	 life,	 what
she	 had	 been	 spared.	 Lord,
she	 had	 soaked	 up	 the	 world—remember,	 Camille,	 how
she	 laughed	 even	 in	 the
hospital?
I	hated	to	point	out	to	my
mother	 that	 such	 was	 the
nature	 of	 a	 bewildered,
expiring	 ten-year-old.	 Why
bother?	 It’s	 impossible	 to
compete	 with	 the	 dead.	 I
wished	I	could	stop	trying.	
Chapter	Five
Alan	 was	 wearing	 white
pants,	 the	 creases	 like	 folded
paper,	 and	 a	 pale	 green
oxford	 when	 I	 came	 down	 to
breakfast.	 He	 sat	 alone	 at	 the
massive	 mahogany	 dining-
room	 set,	 his	 light	 shadow
glowing	 in	 the	 polished
wood.	 I	 peeked	 pointedly	 at
the	 table	 legs	 to	 see	 what	 all
the	 fuss	 of	 last	 night	 wasabout.	 Alan	 chose	 not	 to
notice.	 He	 was	 eating	 milky
eggs	 from	 a	 bowl	 with	 a
teaspoon.	When	he	looked	up
at	 me,	 a	 rubbery	 string	 of
yolk	 swung	 like	 spit	 past	 his
chin.
“Camille.	Sit	down.	What
can	I	have	Gayla	bring	you?”
He	tinkled	the	silver	bell	next
to	 him,	 and	 through	 the
swinging	 kitchen	 door	 came
Gayla,	a	former	farm	girl	who
ten	 years	 ago	 traded	 in	 pigsfor	 daily	 work	 cleaning	 and
cooking	 in	 my	 mother’s
home.	 She	 was	 my	 height—
tall—but	 couldn’t	 have
weighed	 much	 more	 than	 a
hundred	 pounds.	 The	 white
starched	 nursing	 dress	 she
wore	 as	 her	 uniform	 swayed
loosely	on	her,	like	a	bell.
My	mother	walked	in	past
her,	kissed	Alan	on	the	cheek,
sat	a	pear	in	front	of	her	place
on	a	white	cotton	napkin.
“Gayla,	 you	 rememberCamille.”
“Of	 course	 I	 do,	 Mrs.
Crellin,”	 she	 said,	 pointing
her	 vulpine	 face	 at	 me.
Smiled	 with	 mismatched
teeth	 and	 cracked,	 flaky	 lips.
“Hi	 Camille.	 I	 have	 eggs,
toast,	fruit?”
“Just	 coffee	 please.
Cream	and	sugar.”
“Camille,	 we	 picked	 up
food	just	for	you,”	my	mother
said,	 nibbling	 on	 the	 plump
end	 of	 the	 pear.	 “Have	 abanana	at	least.”
“And	 a	 banana.”	 Gayla
headed	 back	 into	 the	 kitchen
with	a	smirk.
“Camille,	
I	
must
apologize	 to	 you	 for	 last
night,”	 Alan	 started.	 “Amma
is	going	through	one	of	those
stages.”
“She’s	 very	 clingy,”	 my
mother	 said.	 “Mostly	 in	 a
sweet	way,	but	sometimes	she
gets	a	bit	out	of	hand.”
“Or	 more	 than	 a	 bit,”	 Isaid.	 “That	 was	 a	 serious
tantrum	 for	 a	 thirteen-year-
old.	 It	 was	 a	 little	 scary.”
That	 was	 the	 Chicago	 me
coming	 back—more	 assured
and	definitely	more	mouthy.	I
was	relieved.
“Yes,	 well,	 you	 weren’t
exactly	placid	yourself	at	that
age.”	 I	 didn’t	 know	 what	 my
mother	 meant—my	 cutting,
my	 crying	 jags	 over	 my	 lost
sister,	 or	 the	 overactive	 sex
life	 I’d	 embarked	 on.	 Idecided	just	to	nod.
“Well,	 I	 hope	 she’s
okay,”	 I	 said	 with	 finality,
and	stood	up	to	leave.
“Please,	 Camille,	 sit	 back
down,”	 said	 Alan	 thinly,
wiping	 the	 corners	 of	 his
mouth.	 “Tell	 us	 about	 the
Windy	 City.	 Spare	 us	 a
minute.”
“Windy	City’s	fine.	Job’s
still	 good,	 been	 getting	 good
feedback.”
“What	 comprises	 goodfeedback?”	 Alan	 leaned
toward	me,	hands	folded,	as	if
he	 thought	 his	 question	 quite
charming.
“Well,	 I’ve	 been	 doing
some	 more	 high-profile
stories.	 I’ve	 covered	 three
murders	 just	 since	 the
beginning	of	the	year.”
“And	 that’s	 a	 good	 thing,
Camille?”	
My	
mother
stopped	 nibbling.	 “I	 will
never	 understand	 where	 your
penchant	 for	 ugliness	 comesfrom.	 Seems	 like	 you	 have
enough	 of	 that	 in	 your	 life
without	 deliberately	 seeking
it	 out.”	 She	 laughed:	 a	 shrill
lilt,	 like	 a	 balloon	 lifted	 in	 a
gust.
Gayla	 returned	 with	 my
coffee	 and	 a	 banana	 wedged
awkwardly	in	a	bowl.	As	she
exited,	 Amma	 entered,	 like
two	 players	 in	 a	 drawing-
room	 farce.	 She	 kissed	 my
mother	 on	 the	 cheek,	 greeted
Alan,	and	sat	across	from	me.Kicked	 me	 once	 under	 the
table	 and	 laughed.	 Oh,	 was
that	you?
“I’m	sorry	you	had	to	see
me	 that	 way,	 Camille,”
Amma	said.	“Especially	since
we	 don’t	 really	 know	 each
other.	 I’m	 just	 going	 through
a	 stage.”	 She	 flashed	 an
overdone	 smile.	 “But	 now
we’re	 reunited.	 You’re	 like
poor	 Cinderella,	 and	 I’m	 the
evil	stepsister.	Half	sister.”
“There’s	 not	 a	 speck	 ofevil	in	you,	sweetheart,”	Alan
said.
“But	 Camille	 was	 the
first.	 First	 is	 usually	 best.
Now	that	she’s	back,	will	you
love	Camille	more	than	me?”
asked	 Amma.	 She	 started	 the
question	 teasingly,	 but	 her
cheeks	 were	 flushed	 as	 she
waited	 for	 my	 mother	 to
respond.
“No,”	 Adora	 said	 quietly.
Gayla	 set	 a	 plate	 of	 ham	 in
front	 of	 Amma,	 who	 pouredhoney	on	it	in	lacy	circles.
“Because	 you	 love	 me,”
Amma	
said,	
between
mouthfuls	 of	 ham.	 The	 sick
smell	 of	 meat	 and	 sweetness
wafted	 over.	 “I	 wish	 I’d	 be
murdered.”
“Amma,	 don’t	 say	 such	 a
thing,”	 my	 mother	 said,
blanching.	
Her	
fingers
fluttered	 to	 her	 eyelashes,
then	back	determinedly	down
on	the	table.
“Then	 I’d	 never	 have	 toworry	 again.	 When	 you	 die,
you	 become	 perfect.	 I’d	 be
like	Princess	Diana.	Everyone
loves	her	now.”
“You	 are	 the	 most
popular	 girl	 in	 your	 whole
school,	 and	 at	 home	 you	 are
adored,	 Amma.	 Don’t	 be
greedy.”
Amma	 kicked	 me	 again
under	 the	 table	 and	 smiled
emphatically,	 as	 if	 some
important	 matter	 had	 been
settled.	She	swung	a	corner	ofthe	 garment	 she	 was	 wearing
over	 her	 shoulder,	 and	 I
realized	what	I’d	thought	was
a	 housedress	 was	 a	 cleverly
wrapped	 blue	 sheet.	 My
mother	noticed,	too.
“What	 in	 the	 world	 are
you	wearing,	Amma?”
“It’s	 my	 maiden	 cloak.
I’m	going	to	the	forest	to	play
Joan	 of	 Arc.	 The	 girls	 will
burn	me.”
“You’ll	do	no	such	thing,
darling,”	my	mother	snapped,grabbing	 the	 honey	 from
Amma,	 who	 was	 about	 to
soak	 her	 ham	 further.	 “Two
girls	 your	 age	 are	 dead,	 and
you	think	you’re	going	to	the
forest	to	play?”
The	children	in	the	woods
play	 wild,	 secret	 games.	 The
beginning	 of	 a	 poem	 I	 once
knew	by	heart.
“Don’t	 worry,	 we’ll	 be
fine.”	 Amma	 smiled	 in	 a
cloying	exaggeration.
“You’ll	stay	here.”Amma	stabbed	at	her	ham
and	 muttered	 something
nasty.	 My	 mother	 turned	 to
me	with	her	head	cocked,	the
diamond	 on	 her	 wedding
finger	 flashing	 in	 my	 eyes
like	an	SOS.
“Now,	Camille,	can	we	at
least	 do	 something	 pleasant
while	 you’re	 here?”	 she
asked.	 “We	 could	 have	 a
picnic	in	the	backyard.	Or	we
could	
take	
out	
the
convertible,	 go	 for	 a	 drive,maybe	play	some	golf	over	in
Woodberry.	 Gayla,	 bring	 me
some	iced	tea,	please.”
“That	 all	 sounds	 nice.	 I
just	 need	 to	 figure	 out	 how
much	longer	I’m	here	for.”
“Yes,	that’d	be	nice	for	us
to	know	also.	Not	that	you’re
not	 welcome	 to	 stay	 as	 long
as	 you	 want,”	 she	 said.	 “But
it	 would	 be	 nice	 for	 us	 to
know,	 so	 we	 could	 make	 our
own	plans.”
“Sure.”	I	took	a	bite	of	thebanana,	which	tasted	like	pale
green	nothing.
“Or	maybe	Alan	and	I	can
come	 up	 there	 sometime	 this
year.	We’ve	never	really	seen
Chicago.”	 My	 hospital	 was
ninety	 minutes	 south	 of	 the
city.	 My	 mother	 flew	 into
O’Hare	 and	 had	 a	 taxi	 drive
her.	 It	 cost	 $128,	 $140	 with
tip.
“That’d	be	good,	too.	We
have	 some	 great	 museums.
You’d	love	the	lake.”“I	 don’t	 know	 that	 I	 can
enjoy	 any	 kind	 of	 water
anymore.”
“Why	 not?”	 I	 already
knew.
“After	that	little	girl,	little
Ann	 Nash,	 was	 left	 in	 the
creek	 to	 drown.”	 She	 paused
to	take	a	sip	of	her	iced	tea.	“I
knew	her,	you	know.”
Amma	 whined	 and	 began
fidgeting	in	her	seat.
“She	 wasn’t	 drowned
though,”	 I	 said,	 knowing	 mycorrection	 would	 annoy	 her.
“She	 was	 strangled.	 She	 just
ended	up	in	the	creek.”
“And	then	the	Keene	girl.
I	 was	 fond	 of	 both	 of	 them.
Very	 fond.”	 She	 stared	 away
wistfully,	 and	 Alan	 put	 his
hand	 over	 hers.	 Amma	 stood
up,	released	a	little	scream	the
way	 an	 excited	 puppy	 might
suddenly	 bark,	 and	 ran
upstairs.
“Poor	 thing,”	 my	 mother
said.	 “She’s	 having	 nearly	 ashard	a	time	as	I	am.”
“She	 actually	 saw	 the
girls	 every	 day,	 so	 I’m	 sure
she	 is,”	 I	 said	 peevishly	 in
spite	 of	 myself.	 “How	 did
you	know	them?”
“Wind	 Gap,	 I	 need	 not
remind	 you,	 is	 a	 small	 town.
They	 were	 sweet,	 beautiful
little	girls.	Just	beautiful.”
“But	 you	 didn’t	 really
know	them.”
“I	did	know	them.	I	knew
them	well.”“How?”
“Camille,	please	try	not	to
do	this.	I’ve	just	told	you	that
I	am	upset	and	unnerved,	and
instead	 of	 being	 comforting,
you	attack	me.”
“So.	You’ve	sworn	off	all
bodies	 of	 water	 in	 the	 future,
then?”
My	 mother	 emitted	 a
quick,	 creaky	 sound.	 “You
need	 to	 shut	 up	 now,
Camille.”	 She	 folded	 the
napkin	around	the	remains	ofher	pear	like	a	swaddling	and
left	 the	 room.	 Alan	 followed
her	 with	 his	 manic	 whistling,
like	 an	 old-time	 piano	 player
lending	 drama	 to	 a	 silent
movie.
Every	
tragedy	
that
happens	in	the	world	happens
to	 my	 mother,	 and	 this	 more
than	anything	about	her	turns
my	 stomach.	 She	 worries
over	 people	 she’s	 never	 met
who	 have	 a	 spell	 of	 bad
chance.	 She	 cries	 over	 newsfrom	across	the	globe.	It’s	all
too	 much	 for	 her,	 the	 cruelty
of	human	beings.
She	 didn’t	 come	 out	 of
her	 room	 for	 a	 year	 after
Marian	 died.	 A	 gorgeous
room:	canopy	bed	the	size	of
a	 ship,	 vanity	 table	 studded
with	 frosted	 perfume	 bottles.
A	 floor	 so	 glorious	 it	 had
been	photographed	by	several
decorating	 magazines:	 Made
from	 pure	 ivory,	 cut	 into
squares,	 it	 lit	 up	 the	 roomfrom	 below.	 That	 room	 and
its	 decadent	 floor	 had	 me
awestruck,	 all	 the	 more	 so
because	 it	 was	 forbidden	 to
me.	 Notables	 like	 Truman
Winslow,	the	mayor	of	Wind
Gap,	 paid	 weekly	 visits,
brought	 fresh	 flowers	 and
classic	 novels.	 I	 could
glimpse	 my	 mother	 on
occasion	 when	 the	 door
opened	to	admit	these	people.
She’d	 be	 in	 bed	 always,
propped	up	on	a	snowdrift	ofpillows,	dressed	in	a	series	of
thin,	 flowered	 robes.	 I	 never
got	to	go	in.
	
Curry’s	 deadline	 for	 the
feature	 was	 only	 two	 days
away,	 and	 I	 had	 little	 to
report.	 Sitting	 in	 my	 room,
spread	 formally	 on	 my	 bed
with	my	hands	clasped	like	a
corpse,	 I	 summed	 up	 what	 I
knew,	forced	it	into	structure.
No	 one	 had	 witnessed	 the
abduction	 of	 Ann	 Nash	 lastAugust.	
She’d	
simply
vanished,	her	body	turning	up
a	 few	 miles	 away	 in	 Falls
Creek	 ten	 hours	 later.	 She’d
been	 strangled	 about	 four
hours	 after	 she	 was	 taken.
Her	 bike	 was	 never	 found.	 If
forced	 to	 guess,	 I’d	 say	 she
knew	 the	 person.	 Grabbing	 a
child	and	her	bike	against	her
will	 would	 be	 a	 noisy
business	on	those	still	streets.
Was	it	someone	from	church,
or	 even	 the	 neighborhood?Someone	who	looked	safe.
But	 with	 the	 first	 murder
committed	 cautiously,	 why
take	 Natalie	 in	 the	 day,	 in
front	 of	 a	 friend?	 It	 didn’t
make	 sense.	 If	 James	 Capisi
had	been	standing	at	the	edge
of	 those	 woods,	 instead	 of
guiltily	 sucking	 up	 sunrays,
would	 he	 be	 dead	 now?	 Or
had	 Natalie	 Keene	 been	 a
deliberate	 target?	 She	 was
held	 longer,	 too:	 She	 was
more	 than	 two	 days	 missingbefore	 her	 body	 appeared,
wedged	 in	 the	 twelve	 inches
between	 the	 hardware	 store
and	 a	 beauty	 parlor	 on	 the
very	public	Main	Street.
What	 did	 James	 Capisi
see?	The	boy	left	me	uneasy.
I	 didn’t	 think	 he	 was	 lying.
But	 children	 digest	 terror
differently.	 The	 boy	 saw	 a
horror,	 and	 that	 horror
became	 the	 wicked	 witch	 of
fairy	 tales,	 the	 cruel	 snow
queen.	But	what	if	this	personsimply	 looked	 feminine?	 A
lanky	 man	 with	 long	 hair,	 a
transvestite,	 an	 androgynous
boy?	 Women	 didn’t	 kill	 this
way,	 they	 just	 didn’t.	 You
could	count	the	list	of	female
serial	killers	on	one	hand,	and
their	 victims	 were	 almost
always	 male—generally	 sex
business	 gone	 bad.	 But	 then
the	girls	hadn’t	been	sexually
assaulted,	and	that	also	didn’t
fit	the	pattern.
The	 choice	 of	 the	 twogirls	also	seemed	senseless.	If
not	 for	 Natalie	 Keene,	 I’d
believe	 they	 were	 victims	 of
sheer	 dumb	 luck.	 But	 if
James	 Capisi	 wasn’t	 lying,
effort	 had	 been	 made	 to	 get
that	 girl	 at	 the	 park,	 and	 if	 it
was	indeed	that	particular	girl
the	 killer	 wanted,	 then	 Ann
was	 not	 sheer	 caprice,	 either.
Neither	girl	was	beautiful	in	a
way	 that	 would	 nurture
obsession.	 Like	 Bob	 Nash
had	 said,	 Ashleigh’s	 theprettiest.	Natalie	came	from	a
moneyed	 family,	 still	 fairly
new	 to	 Wind	 Gap.	 Ann	 was
on	 the	 low	 end	 of	 middle
class,	 and	 the	 Nashes	 had
been	 in	 Wind	 Gap	 for
generations.	The	girls	weren’t
friends.	
Their	
only
connection	 was	 a	 shared
viciousness,	 if	 Vickery’s
stories	 were	 to	 be	 believed.
And	 then	 there	 was	 the
hitchhiker	 theory.	 Could	 that
really	be	what	Richard	Williswas	thinking?	We	were	near	a
major	 trucking	 route	 to	 and
from	 Memphis.	 But	 nine
months	 is	 a	 long	 time	 for	 a
stranger	 to	 go	 unnoticed,	 and
the	 surrounding	 woods	 of
Wind	 Gap	 had	 yielded
nothing	so	far,	not	even	many
animals.	 They	 were	 hunted
out	years	ago.
I	 could	 feel	 my	 thoughts
blowing	 back	 on	 themselves,
dirtied	 with	 old	 prejudices
and	 too	 much	 insiderknowledge.	 I	 suddenly	 felt	 a
desperate	 need	 to	 talk	 to
Richard	 Willis,	 a	 person	 not
from	 Wind	 Gap,	 who	 saw
what	was	happening	as	a	job,
a	 project	 to	 assemble	 and
complete,	 the	 last	 nail	 in
place,	 tidy	 and	 contained.	 I
needed	to	think	like	that.
I	took	a	cool	bath	with	the
lights	 off.	 Then	 I	 sat	 on	 the
edge	 of	 the	 tub	 and	 rubbed
my	 mother’s	 lotion	 all	 over
my	 skin,	 once,	 quickly.	 Itsbumps	 and	 ridges	 made	 me
cringe.
On	 went	 a	 pair	 of	 light
cotton	 pants	 and	 a	 long-
sleeved	 crew	 neck.	 I	 brushed
my	hair	and	looked	at	myself
in	 the	 mirror.	 Despite	 what
I’d	 done	 to	 the	 rest	 of	 my
body,	 my	 face	 was	 still
beautiful.	Not	in	the	way	that
a	 person	 could	 pick	 out	 a
single	 outstanding	 feature,
but	 in	 the	 way	 that	 it	 was	 all
in	 perfect	 balance.	 It	 made	 astunning	 sort	 of	 sense.	 Big
blue	 eyes,	 high	 cheekbones
framing	 a	 small	 triangle	 of	 a
nose.	 Full	 lips	 that	 turned
slightly	 downward	 at	 the
corners.	 I	 was	 lovely	 to	 look
at,	 as	 long	 as	 I	 was	 fully
clothed.	 Had	 things	 turned
out	 differently,	 I	 might	 have
amused	 myself	 with	 a	 series
of	 heart-wretched	 lovers.	 I
might	 have	 dallied	 with
brilliant	 men.	 I	 might	 have
married.Outside,	 our	 section	 of
Missouri	 sky	 was,	 as	 ever,
electric	blue.	It	made	my	eyes
water	to	even	think	of	it.
	
I	 found	 Richard	 at	 the
Broussards’	 diner,	 eating
waffles	without	syrup,	a	stack
of	 folders	 nearly	 as	 high	 as
his	 shoulder	 on	 the	 table.	 I
plopped	 down	 across	 from
him	 and	 felt	 strangely	 happy
—conspiratorial	
and
comfortable.He	looked	up	and	smiled.
“Ms.	 Preaker.	 Have	 some
toast.	Every	time	I	come	here
I	 tell	 them	 no	 toast.	 Doesn’t
seem	 to	 work.	 Like	 they’re
trying	to	meet	a	quota.”
I	 took	 a	 slice,	 spread	 a
flower	 of	 butter	 over	 it.	 The
bread	was	cold	and	hard,	and
my	 bite	 sprayed	 flecks	 onto
the	 table.	 I	 brushed	 them
under	the	plate	and	got	to	the
point.
“Look,	 Richard.	 Talk	 tome.	 On	 record	 or	 off.	 I	 can’t
make	 anything	 out	 of	 this.	 I
can’t	get	objective	enough.”
He	 patted	 the	 stack	 of
files	 next	 to	 him,	 waved	 his
yellow	legal	pad	at	me.	“I’ve
got	 all	 the	 objectivity	 you
want—from	1927	on	at	least.
No	one	knows	what	happened
to	 any	 records	 before	 1927.
Probably	 some	 receptionist
tossed	 them	 out,	 my	 guess,
keep	 the	 poh-lice	 station
uncluttered.”“What	kind	of	records?”
“I’m	compiling	a	criminal
profile	 of	 Wind	 Gap,	 a
history	 of	 the	 town’s
violence,”	he	said,	flapping	a
folder	 at	 me.	 “Did	 you	 know
that	 in	 1975,	 two	 teenage
girls	 were	 found	 dead	 at	 the
edge	of	Falls	Creek,	very	near
where	 Ann	 Nash	 turned	 up,
wrists	cut?	Police	ruled	it	was
self-inflicted.	 Girls	 were
‘overly	 close,	 unhealthily
intimate	 for	 their	 age.	 Ahomosexual	 attachment	 is
suspected.’	 But	 they	 never
found	the	knife.	Weird.”
“One	of	them	was	named
Murray.”
“Ah,	you	do	know.”
“She’d	just	had	a	baby.”
“Yes,	a	little	girl.”
“That	 would	 be	 Faye
Murray.	She	went	to	my	high
school.	 They	 called	 her	 Fag
Murray.	The	boys	would	take
her	 out	 after	 school	 into	 the
woods	 and	 take	 turns	 havingsex	with	her.	Her	mother	kills
herself,	 and	 sixteen	 years
later,	 Faye	 has	 to	 fuck	 every
boy	in	school.”
“I	don’t	follow.”
“To	 prove	 she	 isn’t	 a
lesbian.	 Like	 mother,	 like
daughter,	 right?	 If	 she	 didn’t
fuck	 those	 boys,	 no	 one
would	 have	 had	 anything	 to
do	 with	 her.	 But	 she	 did.	 So
she	 proved	 she	 wasn’t	 a
lesbian,	 but	 that	 she	 was	 a
slut.	 So	 no	 one	 had	 anythingto	 do	 with	 her.	 That’s	 Wind
Gap.	 We	 all	 know	 each
other’s	 secrets.	 And	 we	 all
use	them.”
“Lovely	place.”
“Yes.	 Give	 me	 a
comment.”
“I	just	did.”
It	 made	 me	 laugh,	 and	 I
was	surprised.	I	could	picture
turning	 in	 my	 copy	 to	 Curry:
Police	 have	 no	 leads,	 but
believe	 that	 Wind	 Gap	 is	 a
“lovely	place.”“Look,	Camille,	I’ll	make
a	 deal.	 I’ll	 give	 you	 a
comment	 you	 can	 use	 on	 the
record,	 and	 you	 help	 me	 fill
in	 these	 back	 stories.	 I	 need
someone	 who’ll	 tell	 me	 what
this	 town	 is	 really	 like,	 and
Vickery	 won’t.	 He’s	 very...
protective.”
“Give	 me	 a	 comment	 on
record.	But	work	with	me	off
record.	 I	 won’t	 use	 anything
you	 give	 me	 unless	 you	 say
it’s	 okay.	 You	 can	 useanything	 I	 give	 you.”	 It
wasn’t	 the	 straightest	 of
deals,	but	it	would	have	to	do.
“What	
should	
my
comment	 be?”	 Richard
smiled.
“Do	 you	 really	 believe
these	killings	were	committed
by	an	outsider?”
“For	print?”
“Yeah.”
“We	 have	 not	 ruled
anyone	 out.”	 He	 took	 a	 last
bite	 of	 waffle	 and	 satthinking,	 his	 eyes	 to	 the
ceiling.	“We	are	looking	very
closely	 at	 potential	 suspects
within	the	community,	but	are
also	carefully	considering	the
possibility	 that	 these	 killings
may	 be	 the	 work	 of	 an
outsider.”
“So	you	have	no	clue.”
He	 grinned,	 shrugged	 his
shoulders.	 “I	 gave	 you	 my
comment.”
“Okay,	 off	 record,	 you
have	no	clue?”He	 clicked	 the	 cap	 of	 the
sticky	 syrup	 bottle	 up	 and
down	a	few	times,	placed	his
silverware	 crossways	 on	 his
plate.
“Off	 record,	 Camille,	 do
you	 really	 think	 this	 seems
like	 an	 outsider	 crime?
You’re	a	police	reporter.”
“I	 don’t.”	 Saying	 it	 out
loud	 agitated	 me.	 I	 tried	 to
keep	 my	 eyes	 off	 the	 prongs
of	the	fork	in	front	of	me.
“Smart	girl.”“Vickery	said	you	thought
it	 was	 a	 hitchhiker	 or
something	like	that.”
“Oh,	damn	it,	I	mentioned
that	 as	 a	 possibility	 when	 I
first	 got	 here—nine	 months
ago.	He	holds	on	to	it	like	it’s
proof	 of	 my	 incompetence.
Vickery	 and	 I	 have
communication	issues.”
“Do	 you	 have	 any	 real
suspects?”
“Let	 me	 take	 you	 for
drinks	 this	 week.	 I	 want	 youto	 spill	 everything	 you	 know
about	 everyone	 in	 Wind
Gap.”
He	 grabbed	 the	 check,
pushed	 the	 syrup	 bottle	 back
against	 the	 wall.	 It	 left	 a
sugary	 ring	 on	 the	 table,	 and
without	 thinking,	 I	 dipped	 a
finger	 into	 it,	 put	 it	 to	 my
mouth.	Scars	peeked	out	of	a
shirtsleeve.	 Richard	 looked
up	 just	 as	 I	 was	 putting	 my
hands	back	beneath	the	table.
	I	 didn’t	 mind	 the	 idea	 of
spilling	Wind	Gap’s	stories	to
Richard.	 I	 felt	 no	 particular
allegiance	 to	 the	 town.	 This
was	 the	 place	 my	 sister	 died,
the	 place	 I	 started	 cutting
myself.	A	town	so	suffocating
and	 small,	 you	 tripped	 over
people	 you	 hated	 every	 day.
People	 who	 knew	 things
about	 you.	 It’s	 the	 kind	 of
place	that	leaves	a	mark.
Although	 it’s	 true	 that	 on
the	 surface,	 I	 couldn’t	 havebeen	 treated	 better	 when	 I
lived	here.	My	mother	saw	to
that.	The	town	loved	her,	she
was	 like	 a	 cake	 topping:	 the
most	 beautiful,	 sweet	 girl
Wind	 Gap	 had	 ever	 raised.
Her	parents,	my	grandparents,
had	 owned	 the	 pig	 farm	 and
half	the	houses	around	it,	and
kept	 my	 mother	 under	 the
same	strict	rules	they	applied
to	their	workers:	no	drinking,
no	 smoking,	 no	 cursing,
church	 service	 mandatory.	 Ican	 only	 imagine	 how	 they
must	 have	 taken	 the	 news
when	 my	 mother	 became
pregnant	 at	 seventeen.	 Some
boy	 from	 Kentucky	 who	 she
met	at	church	camp	came	for
a	 Christmas	 visit	 and	 left	 me
in	her	belly.	My	grandparents
grew	 angry	 twin	 tumors	 to
match	
my	
mother’s
expanding	 tummy,	 and	 were
dead	 of	 cancer	 within	 a	 year
of	my	birth.
My	 mother’s	 parents	 hadfriends	 in	 Tennessee,	 and
their	 son	 began	 wooing
Adora	before	I	was	on	solids,
making	 visits	 nearly	 every
weekend.	I	cannot	picture	this
courtship	 as	 anything	 but
awkward.	 Alan,	 pleated	 and
pressed,	 elaborating	 on	 the
weather.	 My	 mother,	 alone
and	 untended	 for	 the	 first
time	 in	 her	 life,	 in	 need	 of	 a
good	 match,	 laughing	 at...
jokes?	 I’m	 not	 sure	 Alan	 has
ever	 made	 a	 joke	 in	 his	 life,but	I’m	sure	my	mother	found
some	 reason	 to	 giggle
girlishly	 for	 him.	 And	 where
was	 I	 in	 this	 picture?
Probably	 in	 some	 far	 corner
room,	kept	quiet	by	the	maid,
Adora	 slipping	 her	 an	 extra
five	 bucks	 for	 the	 trouble.	 I
can	 imagine	 Alan,	 proposing
to	 my	 mother	 while
pretending	 to	 look	 over	 her
shoulder,	 or	 fiddling	 with	 a
plant,	 anything	 to	 avoid	 eye
contact.	My	mother	acceptinggraciously	 and	 then	 pouring
him	more	tea.	A	dry	kiss	was
exchanged,	perhaps.
No	 matter.	 By	 the	 time	 I
could	talk,	they	were	married.
I	 know	 almost	 nothing	 about
my	 real	 father.	 The	 name	 on
the	 birth	 certificate	 is	 fake:
Newman	 Kennedy,	 for	 my
mother’s	 favorite	 actor	 and
president,	 respectively.	 She
refused	 to	 tell	 me	 his	 true
name,	 lest	 I	 hunt	 him	 down.
No,	 I	 was	 to	 be	 consideredAlan’s	 child.	 This	 was
difficult,	 as	 she	 soon	 had
Alan’s	 child,	 eight	 months
after	he	married	her.	She	was
twenty,	 he	 was	 thirty-five,
with	 family	 money	 that	 my
mother	 didn’t	 need,	 having
plenty	of	her	own.	Neither	of
them	 have	 ever	 worked.	 I’ve
learned	 little	 else	 of	 Alan
over	the	years.	He’s	a	ribbon-
winning	 equestrian	 who
doesn’t	ride	anymore	because
it	makes	Adora	nervous.	He’soften	 ill,	 and	 even	 when	 he’s
not,	 he’s	 mostly	 immobile.
He	 reads	 countless	 books	 on
the	 Civil	 War	 and	 seems
content	 to	 let	 my	 mother	 do
most	 of	 the	 talking.	 He’s	 as
smooth	 and	 shallow	 as	 glass.
Then	 again,	 Adora	 has	 never
tried	to	forge	a	bond	between
us.	 I	 was	 considered	 Alan’s
child	but	never	really	fathered
by	 him,	 never	 encouraged	 to
call	 him	 anything	 but	 his
proper	name.	Alan	never	gaveme	 his	 last	 name	 and	 I	 never
asked	 for	 it.	 I	 remember
trying	 out	 Dad	 once	 when	 I
was	 little,	 and	 the	 shock	 on
his	face	was	enough	to	scotch
any	further	attempts.	Frankly,
I	 think	 Adora	 prefers	 us	 to
feel	like	strangers.	She	wants
all	 relationships	 in	 the	 house
to	run	through	her.
Ah,	but	back	to	the	baby.
Marian	 was	 a	 sweet	 series	 of
diseases.	 She	 had	 trouble
breathing	 from	 the	 start,would	 wake	 in	 the	 night
spluttering	 for	 air,	 splotchy
and	gray.	I	could	hear	her	like
a	 sick	 wind	 down	 the	 hall
from	me,	in	the	bedroom	next
to	 my	 mother.	 Lights	 would
click	 on	 and	 there	 would	 be
cooing,	 or	 sometimes	 crying
or	 shouting.	 Regular	 trips	 to
the	emergency	room,	twenty-
five	
miles	
away	
in
Woodberry.	 Later	 she	 had
trouble	 digesting	 and	 sat
murmuring	 to	 her	 dolls	 in	 ahospital	 bed	 set	 up	 in	 her
room,	 while	 my	 mother
poured	 sustenance	 into	 her
through	 IVs	 and	 feeding
tubes.
During	 those	 last	 years,
my	 mother	 pulled	 out	 all	 her
eyelashes.	 She	 couldn’t	 keep
her	 fingers	 off	 them.	 She	 left
little	 piles	 of	 them	 on
tabletops.	 I	 told	 myself	 they
were	 fairy	 nests.	 I	 remember
finding	 two	 long	 blonde
lashes	stuck	to	the	side	of	myfoot,	 and	 I	 kept	 them	 for
weeks	 next	 to	 my	 pillow.	 At
night	I	tickled	my	cheeks	and
lips	with	them,	until	one	day	I
woke	 to	 find	 them	 blown
away.
By	 the	 time	 my	 sister
finally	died,	I	was	grateful	in
a	 way.	 It	 seemed	 to	 me	 that
she’d	 been	 expelled	 into	 this
world	 not	 quite	 formed.	 She
was	 not	 ready	 for	 its	 weight.
People	 whispered	 comfort
about	 Marian	 being	 calledback	 to	 heaven,	 but	 my
mother	 would	 not	 be
distracted	 from	 her	 grief.	 To
this	day	it	remains	a	hobby.
	
My	 car,	 faded	 blue,
covered	 with	 bird	 crap,	 its
leather	 seats	 sure	 to	 be
steaming,	 didn’t	 exactly
beckon	 me,	 so	 I	 decided	 to
take	 a	 turn	 around	 town.	 On
Main	 Street,	 I	 passed	 the
poultry	 shop,	 where	 chickens
are	dropped	off	fresh	from	theArkansas	 killing	 fields.	 The
smell	 flared	 my	 nostrils.	 A
dozen	 or	 more	 stripped	 birds
hung	 lasciviously	 in	 the
window,	a	few	white	feathers
papering	 the	 ledge	 beneath
them.
Toward	 the	 end	 of	 the
street,	 where	 a	 makeshift
shrine	 to	 Natalie	 had	 sprung
up,	I	could	see	Amma	and	her
three	 friends.	 They	 were
sifting	 through	 the	 balloons
and	 drugstore	 gifts,	 threestanding	guard	while	my	half
sister	 snatched	 up	 two
candles,	a	bouquet	of	flowers,
and	 a	 teddy	 bear.	 All	 but	 the
bear	 went	 into	 her	 oversized
purse.	 The	 teddy	 she	 held	 as
the	 girls	 locked	 arms	 and
skipped	 mockingly	 toward
me.	 Straight	 at	 me	 actually,
not	 stopping	 until	 they	 were
an	 inch	 from	 me,	 filling	 the
air	 with	 the	 kind	 of	 heavy
perfume	
dispensed	
on
powdered	
strips	
inmagazines.
“Did	 you	 see	 us	 do	 that?
Are	 you	 going	 to	 put	 it	 in
your	 newspaper	 story?”
Amma	 shrieked.	 She’d
definitely	 gotten	 over	 her
dollhouse	 tantrum.	 Such
childish	 things,	 clearly,	 were
left	 at	 home.	 Now	 she’d
traded	 in	 her	 sundress	 and
was	 wearing	 a	 miniskirt,
platform	 sandals,	 and	 a	 tube
top.	“If	you	are,	get	my	name
right:	 Amity	 Adora	 Crellin.Guys,	 this	 is...my	 sister.
From	Chicago.	The	bastard	of
the	 family.”	 Amma	 wiggled
her	 eyebrows	 at	 me,	 and	 the
girls	 giggled.	 “Camille,	 these
are	my	loooovely	friends,	but
you	don’t	need	to	write	about
them.	I’m	the	leader.”
“She’s	 just	 the	 leader
because	 she’s	 the	 loudest,”
said	a	small	honey-haired	girl
with	a	husky	voice.
“And	 she	 has	 the	 biggest
tits,”	 said	 a	 second	 girl,	 withhair	the	color	of	a	brass	bell.
The	 third	 girl,	 a
strawberry	 blonde,	 grabbed
Amma’s	 left	 breast,	 gave	 it	 a
squeeze:	 “Part	 real,	 part
padding.”
“Fuck	 off,	 Jodes,”	 Amma
said,	 and	 as	 if	 disciplining	 a
cat,	 smacked	 her	 on	 the	 jaw.
The	 girl	 flushed	 splotchy	 red
and	muttered	a	sorry.
“Anyway,	 what’s	 your
deal,	
sister?”	
Amma
demanded,	 looking	 down	 ather	 teddy.	 “Why	 are	 you
writing	 a	 story	 about	 two
dead	girls	who	no	one	noticed
to	 begin	 with?	 Like	 getting
killed	 makes	 you	 popular.”
Two	 of	 the	 girls	 forced	 loud
laughs;	 the	 third	 was	 still
staring	 at	 the	 ground.	 A	 tear
splashed	on	the	sidewalk.
I	
recognized	
this
provocative	 girl	 talk.	 It	 was
the	 verbal	 equivalent	 of
farming	 my	 yard.	 And	 while
part	 of	 me	 appreciated	 theshow,	I	was	feeling	protective
of	 Natalie	 and	 Ann,	 and	 my
sister’s	 aggressive	 disrespect
raised	 my	 hackles.	 To	 be
honest,	 I	 should	 add	 that	 I
was	 also	 feeling	 jealous	 of
Amma.	 (Her	 middle	 name
was	Adora?)
“I	 bet	 Adora	 wouldn’t	 be
happy	 to	 read	 that	 her
daughter	 stole	 items	 from	 a
tribute	 to	 one	 of	 her
schoolmates,”	I	said.
“Schoolmate	 isn’t	 thesame	 as	 friend,”	 said	 the	 tall
girl,	 glancing	 around	 for
confirmation	of	my	stupidity.
“Oh,	 Camille,	 we’re	 just
kidding,”	 Amma	 said.	 “I	 feel
horrible.	 They	 were	 nice
girls.	Just	weird.”
“Definitely	weird,”	one	of
them	echoed.
“Ohhh	 guys,	 what	 if	 he’s
killing	all	the	freaks?”	Amma
giggled.	 “Wouldn’t	 that	 be
perfect?”	 The	 crying	 girl
looked	 up	 at	 this	 and	 smiled.Amma	pointedly	ignored	her.
“He?”	I	asked.
“Everyone	 knows	 who
did	it,”	the	husky	blonde	said.
“Natalie’s	brother.	Freaks
run	 in	 families,”	 Amma
proclaimed.
“He’s	 got	 a	 little-girl
thing,”	 the	 girl	 called	 Jodes
said	sulkily.
“He’s	 always	 finding
excuses	to	talk	to	me,”	Amma
said.	“At	least	now	I	know	he
won’t	kill	me.	Too	cool.”	Sheblew	 an	 air	 kiss	 and	 handed
the	teddy	to	Jodes,	looped	her
arms	 around	 the	 other	 girls,
and,	 with	 a	 cheeky	 “’Scuse,”
bumped	past	me.	Jodes	trailed
behind.
In	 Amma’s	 snideness,	 I
caught	a	whiff	of	desperation
and	righteousness.	Like	she’d
whined	 at	 breakfast:	 I	 wish
I’d	 be	 murdered.	 Amma
didn’t	 want	 anyone	 to	 get
more	 attention	 than	 her.
Certainly	 not	 girls	 whocouldn’t	 compete	 when	 they
were	alive.
	
I	 phoned	 Curry	 near
midnight,	 at	 his	 home.	 Curry
does	 a	 reverse	 commute,
ninety	 minutes	 to	 our
suburban	 office	 from	 the
single-family	 his	 parents	 left
him	 in	 Mt.	 Greenwood,	 a
working-class	 Irish	 enclave
on	the	South	Side.	He	and	his
wife,	 Eileen,	 have	 no
children.	 Never	 wanted	 any,Curry	 always	 barks,	 but	 I’ve
seen	 the	 way	 he	 eyes	 his
staffers’	 toddlers	 from	 afar,
what	 close	 attention	 he	 pays
when	 a	 baby	 makes	 a	 rare
appearance	 in	 our	 office.
Curry	 and	 his	 wife	 married
late.	 I	 guessed	 they’d	 been
unable	to	conceive.
Eileen	 is	 a	 curvy	 woman
with	red	hair	and	freckles	that
he	 met	 at	 his	 neighborhood
car	 wash	 when	 he	 was	 forty-
two.	 It	 turned	 out,	 later	 on,that	 she	 was	 a	 second	 cousin
of	 his	 childhood	 best	 friend.
They	married	three	months	to
the	day	they	first	spoke.	Been
together	 for	 twenty-two
years.	 I	 like	 that	 Curry	 likes
to	tell	the	story.
Eileen	 was	 warm	 when
she	 answered	 the	 phone,
which	was	what	I	needed.	Of
course	 they	 weren’t	 asleep,
she	 laughed.	 Curry	 was,	 in
fact,	 working	 on	 one	 of	 his
puzzles,	 4,500	 pieces.	 It	 hadall	 but	 taken	 over	 the	 living
room,	and	she	had	given	him
one	week	to	complete	it.
I	could	hear	Curry	rumble
to	 the	 phone,	 could	 almost
smell	 his	 tobacco.	 “Preaker,
my	 girl,	 what	 gives?	 You
okay?”
“I’m	 okay.	 There’s	 just
not	 a	 lot	 of	 headway	 down
here.	 It’s	 taken	 this	 long	 just
to	 get	 an	 official	 police
statement.”
“Which	is?”“They’re	 looking	 at
everyone.”
“Fah.	That’s	crap.	There’s
got	to	be	more.	Find	out.	You
talk	to	the	parents	again?”
“Not	yet.”
“Talk	 to	 the	 parents.	 If
you	 can’t	 break	 anything,	 I
want	 that	 profile	 on	 the	 dead
girls.	 This	 is	 human-interest
stuff,	 not	 just	 straight	 police
reporting.	 Talk	 to	 other
parents,	 too,	 see	 if	 they	 have
theories.	Ask	if	they’re	takingextra	 precautions.	 Talk	 to
locksmiths	 and	 gun	 dealers,
see	 if	 they’re	 getting	 extra
business.	 Get	 a	 clergyman	 in
there	 or	 some	 teachers.
Maybe	 a	 dentist,	 see	 how
hard	it	is	to	pull	out	that	many
teeth,	what	kind	of	tool	you’d
use,	 whether	 you	 have	 to
have	some	sort	of	experience.
Talk	 to	 some	 kids.	 I	 want
voices,	I	want	faces.	Give	me
thirty	inches	for	Sunday;	let’s
work	 this	 while	 we	 still	 haveit	exclusive.”
I	 took	 notes	 first	 on	 a
legal	pad,	then	in	my	head,	as
I	began	outlining	the	scars	on
my	right	arm	with	my	felt-tip
pen.
“You	mean	before	there’s
another	murder.”
“Unless	the	police	know	a
damn	 lot	 more	 than	 they’re
giving	 you,	 there’s	 going	 to
be	another,	yeah.	This	kind	of
guy	 doesn’t	 stop	 after	 two,
not	when	it’s	this	ritualistic.”Curry	 doesn’t	 know	 a
thing	
firsthand	
about
ritualistic	 killings,	 but	 he
plows	 through	 a	 few	 low-
grade	 true-crimers	 a	 week,
yellowed	 paperbacks	 with
glossy	 covers	 he	 picks	 up	 at
his	used	bookstore.	Two	for	a
buck,	 Preaker,	 that’s	 what	 I
call	entertainment.
“So,	 Cubby,	 any	 theories
on	whether	it’s	a	local?”
Curry	 seemed	 to	 like	 the
nickname	for	me,	his	favoritecub	 reporter.	 His	 voice
always	 tickled	 when	 he	 used
it,	 as	 if	 the	 word	 itself	 was
blushing.	 I	 could	 picture	 him
in	the	living	room,	eyeing	his
puzzle,	 Eileen	 taking	 a	 quick
drag	 on	 his	 cigarette	 while
she	stirred	up	tuna	salad	with
sweet	 pickles	 for	 Curry’s
lunch.	 He	 ate	 it	 three	 days	 a
week.
“Off	 record,	 they	 say
yes.”
“Well,	 dammit,	 get	 themto	 say	 it	 on	 record.	 We	 need
that.	That’s	good.”
“Here’s	
something
strange,	 Curry.	 I	 talked	 to	 a
boy	 who	 says	 he	 was	 with
Natalie	 when	 she	 was	 taken.
He	said	it	was	a	woman.”
“A	 woman?	 It’s	 not	 a
woman.	 What	 do	 the	 police
say?”
“No	comment.”
“Who’s	the	kid?”
“Son	 of	 a	 hog	 worker.
Sweet	 boy.	 He	 seems	 reallyscared,	Curry.”
“The	 police	 don’t	 believe
him,	or	you’d’ve	heard	about
it.	Right?”
“I	 honestly	 don’t	 know.
They’re	tight	here.”
“Christ,	 Preaker,	 break
those	boys.	Get	something	on
record.”
“Easier	said.	I	kind	of	feel
it’s	 almost	 a	 detriment	 that
I’m	 from	 here.	 They	 resent
me	 carpetbagging	 back	 home
for	this.”“Make	 them	 like	 you.
You’re	a	likable	person.	Your
mom	will	vouch	for	you.”
“My	mom’s	not	so	happy
I’m	here,	either.”
Silence,	 then	 a	 sigh	 from
Curry’s	 end	 of	 the	 line	 that
buzzed	my	ears.	My	right	arm
was	a	road	map	of	deep	blue.
“You	
doing	
okay,
Preaker?	 You	 taking	 care	 of
yourself?”
I	 didn’t	 say	 anything.	 I
suddenly	felt	like	I	might	cry.“I’m	 okay.	 This	 place
does	 bad	 things	 to	 me.	 I
feel...wrong.”
“You	 keep	 it	 together,
girl.	 You’re	 doing	 real	 good.
You’re	going	to	be	fine.	And
if	you	feel	unfine,	call	me.	I’ll
get	you	out.”
“Okay,	Curry.”
“Eileen	 says	 be	 careful.
Hell,	I	say	be	careful.”	
Chapter	Six
Small	towns	usually	cater
to	 one	 kind	 of	 drinker.	 That
kind	may	vary:	There	are	the
honky-tonk	 towns,	 which
keep	 their	 bars	 on	 the
outskirts,	 make	 their	 patrons
feel	 a	 little	 bit	 outlaw.	 There
are	 the	 upscale	 sipping-drink
towns,	 with	 bars	 that
overcharge	 for	 a	 gin	 ricky	 so
the	poor	people	have	to	drinkat	 home.	 There	 are	 the
middle-class	strip-mall	towns,
where	beers	come	with	onion
blossoms	 and	 cutely	 named
sandwiches.
Luckily	 everyone	 drinks
in	 Wind	 Gap,	 so	 we	 have	 all
those	bars	and	more.	We	may
be	 small,	 but	 we	 can	 drink
most	 towns	 under	 the	 table.
The	 watering	 hole	 closest	 to
my	 mother’s	 home	 was	 an
expensive,	 glassy	 box	 that
specialized	in	salads	and	winespritzers,	 Wind	 Gap’s	 sole
upscale	eatery.	It	was	brunch-
time,	and	I	couldn’t	stand	the
idea	 of	 Alan	 and	 his	 soupy
eggs,	so	I	walked	myself	over
to	 La	 Mère.	 My	 French	 goes
only	 to	 eleventh	 grade,	 but
judging	 from	 the	 restaurant’s
aggressively	nautical	theme,	I
think	 the	 owners	 meant	 to
name	it	La	Mer,	The	Sea,	and
not	 La	 Mère,	 The	 Mother.
Still,	 the	 name	 was
appropriate,	 as	 The	 Mother,my	 mother,	 frequented	 this
place,	as	did	her	friends.	They
all	 just	 love	 the	 chicken
Caesar,	 which	 is	 neither
French	 nor	 seafood,	 but	 I’m
not	 going	 to	 be	 the	 one	 to
press	the	point.
“Camille!”	 A	 blonde	 in	 a
tennis	 outfit	 came	 trotting
across	 the	 room,	 glowing
with	 gold	 necklaces	 and
chunky	 rings.	 It	 was	 Adora’s
best	friend,	Annabelle	Gasser,
née	 Anderson,	 nicknamedAnnie-B.	 It	 was	 commonly
known	
that	
Annabelle
absolutely	
hated	
her
husband’s	 last	 name—she
even	 crumpled	 up	 her	 nose
when	 she	 said	 it.	 It	 never
occurred	to	her	that	she	didn’t
have	to	take	it.
“Hi	 sweetheart,	 your
momma	 told	 me	 you	 were	 in
town.”	 Unlike	 poor,	 Adora-
ousted	Jackie	O’Neele,	who	I
also	 spotted	 at	 the	 table,
looking	 just	 as	 tipsy	 as	 shehad	 at	 the	 funeral.	 Annabelle
kissed	 both	 my	 cheeks	 and
stepped	 back	 to	 assess	 me.
“Still	 pretty-pretty.	 Come	 on,
come	 sit	 with	 us.	 We’re	 just
having	 a	 few	 bottles	 of	 wine
and	 gabbing.	 You	 can	 lower
the	age	ratio	for	us.”
Annabelle	pulled	me	over
to	 a	 table	 where	 Jackie	 sat
chatting	up	two	more	blonde,
tanned	 women.	 She	 didn’t
even	 stop	 talking	 while
Annabelle	
madeintroductions,	
she	
just
continued	 droning	 about	 her
new	 bedroom	 set,	 then
knocked	over	a	glass	of	water
as	she	jerked	back	to	me.
“Camille?	 You’re	 here!
I’m	 so	 happy	 to	 see	 you
again,	 sweetie.”	 She	 seemed
sincere.	 That	 Juicy	 Fruit
smell	wafted	off	her	again.
“She’s	 been	 here	 for	 five
minutes,”	 snapped	 another
blonde,	 wiping	 the	 ice	 and
water	 onto	 the	 floor	 with	 aswipe	 of	 her	 dark	 hand.
Diamonds	 flashed	 from	 two
fingers.
“Right,	 I	 remember.
You’re	 here	 covering	 the
murders,	 bad	 girl,”	 Jackie
continued.	 “Adora	 must	 hate
that.	 Sleeping	 in	 her	 house
with	 your	 dirty	 little	 brain.”
She	 smiled	 a	 smile	 that	 must
have	been	saucy	twenty	years
ago.	 Now	 it	 seemed	 slightly
mad.
“Jackie!”	 said	 a	 blonde,aiming	 bright	 saucer	 eyes	 at
her.
“’Course	 before	 Adora
took	it	over,	we	all	slept	over
at	Joya’s	house	with	our	dirty
little	 brains.	 Same	 house,
different	 crazy	 lady	 running
it,”	 she	 said	 to	 me,	 fingering
the	 flesh	 behind	 her	 ears.
Stitches	from	that	facelift?
“You	 never	 knew	 your
grandma	 Joya,	 did	 you,
Camille?”	purred	Annabelle.
“Woo!	She	was	a	piece	ofwork,	 sweetie,”	 said	 Jackie.
“Scary,	scary	woman.”
“How	 so?”	 I	 asked.	 I’d
never	heard	such	detail	about
my	 grandmother.	 Adora
allowed	 that	 she	 was	 strict,
but	said	little	else.
“Oh,	
Jackie’s
exaggerating,”	
Annabelle
said.	 “No	 one	 likes	 their
mother	 when	 they’re	 in	 high
school.	 And	 Joya	 was	 dead
pretty	 soon	 after.	 They	 never
really	had	time	to	establish	anadult	relationship.”
For	 a	 second	 I	 had	 a
pitiful	 dash	 of	 hope,	 that	 this
was	 why	 my	 mother	 and	 I
were	 so	 distant:	 She	 had	 no
practice.	 The	 idea	 was	 dead
before	 Annabelle	 finished
refilling	my	glass.
“Right,	
Annabelle,”
Jackie	said.	“I’m	sure	if	Joya
were	alive	today,	they’d	have
a	 grand	 old	 time.	 At	 least
Joya	 would.	 She’d	 just	 love
to	tear	at	Camille.	Rememberthose	long,	long	nails	of	hers?
Never	painted	them.	I	always
thought	that	was	weird.”
“Change	 of	 subject,”
Annabelle	 smiled,	 each	 word
like	 the	 tinkle	 of	 a	 silver
dinner	bell.
“I	 think	 Camille’s	 job
must	 be	 so	 fascinating,”	 said
one	of	the	blondes	dutifully.
“Especially	this	one,”	said
another.
“Yeah	 Camille,	 tell	 us
who	 did	 it,”	 blurted	 Jackie.She	 smiled	 leeringly	 again
and	 clicked	 her	 round	 brown
eyes	 open	 and	 shut.	 She
reminded	
me	
of	
a
ventriloquist	 dummy	 come
alive.	 With	 hard	 skin	 and
broken	capillaries.
I	had	a	few	calls	to	make,
but	 decided	 this	 could	 be
better.	 A	 quartet	 of	 drunk,
bored,	and	bitchy	housewives
who	 knew	 all	 the	 gossip	 of
Wind	 Gap?	 I	 could	 write	 it
off	as	a	business	lunch.“Actually	
I’d	
be
interested	 to	 know	 what	 you
all	 think.”	 A	 sentence	 they
couldn’t	hear	very	often.
Jackie	 dipped	 her	 bread
into	 a	 side	 dish	 of	 ranch
dressing,	 then	 dripped	 it
down	her	front.	“Well	you	all
know	 what	 I	 think.	 Ann’s
daddy,	 Bob	 Nash.	 He’s	 a
pervert.	 He	 always	 stares	 at
my	 chest	 when	 I	 see	 him	 at
the	store.”
“What	 chest	 there	 is,”said	 Annabelle,	 and	 nudged
me	jokingly.
“I’m	 serious,	 it’s	 out	 of
line.	I’ve	been	meaning	to	tell
Steven	about	it.”
“I’ve	 got	 yummy	 news,”
said	 the	 fourth	 blonde.	 Dana
or	 Diana?	 I	 forgot	 it	 as	 soon
as	Annabelle	introduced	us.
“Oh,	DeeAnna	always	has
good	
scoop,	
Camille,”
Annabelle	said,	squeezing	my
arm.	 DeeAnna	 paused	 for
effect,	 licked	 her	 teeth,poured	 herself	 another	 glass
of	wine,	and	peeked	over	it	at
us.
“John	 Keene	 has	 moved
out	 of	 his	 parents’	 house,”
she	announced.
“What?”	said	a	blonde.
“You	 are	 joooking,”	 said
another.
“My	 word,”	 gushed	 a
third.
“And...”	 said	 DeeAnna
triumphantly,	 smiling	 like	 a
game-show	 hostess	 about	 tobestow	 a	 prize.	 “Into	 Julie
Wheeler’s	home.	The	carriage
house	out	back.”
“That	 is	 too	 good,”	 said
Melissa	or	Melinda.
“Oh,	 you	 know	 they’re
doing	 it	 now,”	 laughed
Annabelle.	
“No	
way
Meredith	 can	 keep	 her	 Little
Miss	Perfect	thing	going.	See,
Camille,”	 she	 turned	 to	 me,
“John	 Keene	 is	 Natalie’s	 big
brother,	and	when	that	family
moved	 here,	 the	 whole	 townwent	 loony	 for	 him.	 I	 mean,
he’s	 gorgeous.	 He.	 Is.
Gorgeous.	 Julie	 Wheeler,
she’s	 a	 friend	 of	 your
momma’s	 and	 ours.	 Didn’t
have	babies	till	she	was,	like,
thirty,	 and	 when	 she	 did,	 she
became	just	insufferable.	One
of	 those	 people	 whose	 kids
can	 do	 no	 wrong.	 So	 when
Meredith—her	 daughter—
snagged	 John,	 oh	 my	 God.
We	 thought	 we’d	 never	 hear
the	 end	 of	 it.	 Meredith,	 thisA-student	 little	 virgin	 girl
gets	the	Big	Man	on	Campus.
But	 no	 way	 a	 boy	 like	 that,
his	age,	goes	with	a	girl	who
isn’t	 putting	 out.	 Just	 doesn’t
work	that	way.	And	now,	it’s
so	 convenient	 for	 them.	 We
should	get	Polaroids	and	stick
them	under	Julie’s	windshield
wipers.”
“Well,	 you	 know	 how
she’s	 playing	 it,”	 Jackie
interrupted.	 “It’s	 going	 to	 be
all	 about	 how	 good	 they	 areto	take	John	in	and	give	him	a
little	breathing	room	while	he
mourns.”
“Why	 is	 he	 moving	 out,
though?”	
asked
Melissa/Melinda,	 who	 I	 was
starting	to	think	was	the	voice
of	reason.	“I	mean,	shouldn’t
he	be	with	his	folks	at	a	time
like	this?	Why	would	he	need
breathing	room?”
“Because	he’s	 the	 killer,”
DeeAnna	 blurted,	 and	 the
table	began	laughing.“Oh,	 that	 would	 be	 so
delicious	if	Meredith	Wheeler
were	 giving	 it	 to	 some	 serial
killer,”	 Jackie	 said.	 Suddenly
the	 table	 stopped	 laughing.
Annabelle	 emitted	 a	 sneezy
hiccup	 and	 looked	 at	 her
watch.	 Jackie	 rested	 her	 chin
on	 her	 hand,	 breathed	 out
hard	 enough	 to	 bluster	 the
bread	crumbs	on	her	plate.
“I	 can’t	 believe	 this	 is
really	 happening,”	 said
DeeAnna,	 looking	 down	 ather	nails.	“In	our	town,	where
we	grew	up.	Those	little	girls.
It	 makes	 me	 feel	 sick	 to	 my
stomach.	Just	sick.”
“I’m	 so	 glad	 my	 girls	 are
grown	up,”	Annabelle	said.	“I
just	don’t	think	I’d	be	able	to
take	 it.	 Poor	 Adora	 must	 be
worried	sick	about	Amma.”
I	nabbed	a	piece	of	bread
in	 the	 birdy,	 girlish	 way	 of
my	hostesses,	and	steered	the
conversation	 away	 from
Adora.	 “Do	 people	 reallythink	 John	 Keene	 could	 have
had	anything	to	do	with	it?	Or
is	 that	 just	 mean	 gossip?”	 I
could	feel	myself	spitting	out
the	 last	 part.	 I’d	 forgotten
how	 unlivable	 women	 like
these	 could	 make	 Wind	 Gap
for	people	they	didn’t	like.	“I
ask	 only	 because	 a	 group	 of
girls,	 probably	 junior-high-
schoolers,	said	the	same	thing
to	me	yesterday.”	I	thought	it
best	 not	 to	 mention	 Amma
was	one	of	them.“Let	 me	 guess,	 four	 little
mouthy	 blonde	 things	 who
think	 they’re	 prettier	 than
they	are,”	Jackie	said.
“Jackie,	 sweetheart,	 do
you	realize	who	you	just	said
that	 to?”	 Melissa/Melinda
said,	 slapping	 her	 hand	 on
Jackie’s	shoulder.
“Oh	 shit.	 I	 always	 forget
Amma	 and	 Camille	 are	 even
related—different	 lifetimes,
you	know?”	Jackie	smiled.	A
hearty	 pop	 sounded	 behindher	 and	 she	 lifted	 her
wineglass	 without	 even
looking	 at	 the	 waiter.
“Camille,	 you	 might	 as	 well
hear	 it	 here:	 Your	 little
Amma	is	truuuuble.”
“I	 hear	 they	 come	 to	 all
the	 high-school	 parties,”
DeeAnna	 said.	 “And	 take	 all
the	 boys.	 And	 do	 things	 we
didn’t	 do	 till	 we	 were	 old
married	 women—and	 then
only	after	the	transaction	of	a
few	 nice	 pieces	 of	 jewelry.”She	twirled	a	diamond	tennis
bracelet.
They	 all	 laughed;	 Jackie
actually	 pounded	 the	 table
with	 both	 fists	 like	 a	 toddler
in	a	fit.
“But	do...”
“I	 don’t	 know	 if	 people
really	 think	 John	 did	 it.	 I
know	 the	 police	 talked	 to
him,”	
Annabelle	
said.
“They’re	 definitely	 a	 strange
family.”
“Oh,	 I	 thought	 you	 wereclose,”	 I	 said.	 “I	 saw	 you	 at
their	house	after	the	funeral.”
You	fucking	cunts,	I	added	in
my	head.
“Everybody	 important	 in
the	town	of	Wind	Gap	was	in
that	 house	 after	 the	 funeral,”
DeeAnna	said.	“Like	we	were
going	 to	 miss	 a	 function	 like
that.”	 She	 tried	 to	 start	 the
laughter	 going	 again,	 but
Jackie	 and	 Annabelle	 were
nodding	
solemnly.
Melissa/Melinda	
lookedaround	the	restaurant	as	if	she
could	 wish	 herself	 to	 another
table.
“Where’s	 your	 momma?”
Annabelle	 suddenly	 blurted.
“She	 needs	 to	 come	 down
here.	 Could	 do	 her	 good.
She’s	 been	 acting	 so	 strange
since	this	all	started.”
“She	 was	 acting	 strange
before	 this	 started,	 too,”
Jackie	said,	working	her	jaw.
I	 wondered	 if	 she	 was	 going
to	vomit.“Oh	please,	Jackie.”
“I’m	 serious.	 Camille,	 let
me	 say	 this:	 Right	 now,	 way
things	 are	 with	 your	 mother,
you’re	better	in	Chicago.	You
should	 go	 back	 soon.”	 Her
face	had	lost	its	manicness—
she	
looked	
completely
solemn.	 And	 genuinely
concerned.	I	felt	myself	liking
her	again.
“Truly,	Camille...”
“Jackie,	
shut	
up,”
Annabelle	 said,	 and	 threw	 aroll,	 hard,	 at	 Jackie’s	 face.	 It
bounced	 off	 her	 nose	 and
thumped	 onto	 the	 table.	 A
silly	 flash	 of	 violence,	 like
when	 Dee	 threw	 his	 tennis
ball	 at	 me—you’re	 less
shocked	 by	 the	 impact	 than
the	 fact	 it	 happened	 at	 all.
Jackie	 registered	 the	 hit	 with
a	 wave	 of	 her	 hand	 and	 kept
talking.
“I’ll	 say	 what	 I	 please,
and	 I’m	 saying,	 Adora	 can
harm...”Annabelle	 stood	 up	 and
walked	 over	 to	 Jackie’s	 side,
pulled	her	up	by	her	arm.
“Jackie,	you	need	to	make
yourself	 throw	 up,”	 she	 said.
Her	 voice	 was	 a	 cross
between	 a	 coo	 and	 a	 threat.
“You’ve	 had	 too	 much	 to
drink,	 and	 you’re	 going	 to
feel	 real	 sick	 otherwise.	 Let
me	 take	 you	 to	 the	 lady’s
room	and	help	make	you	feel
better.”
Jackie	 smacked	 her	 handaway	at	first,	but	Annabelle’s
grip	 tightened	 and	 the	 two
soon	tottered	away.	Silence	at
the	 table.	 My	 mouth	 hung
open.
“That’s	
nothing,”
DeeAnna	 said.	 “We	 old	 girls
have	 little	 fights	 the	 same
way	 you	 young	 girls	 do.	 So
Camille,	 have	 you	 heard	 we
might	be	getting	a	Gap?”
	
Jackie’s	words	stuck	with
me:	Way	things	are	with	yourmother,	 you’re	 better	 in
Chicago.	How	much	more	of
a	 sign	 did	 I	 need	 to	 leave
Wind	 Gap?	 I	 wondered
exactly	 why	 she	 and	 Adora
had	 fallen	 out.	 Had	 to	 be
more	 than	 a	 forgotten
greeting	 card.	 I	 made	 a
mental	 note	 to	 drop	 by
Jackie’s	 when	 she	 was	 less
looped.	If	she	ever	was.	Then
again,	I	was	hardly	the	one	to
frown	on	a	drinker.
Sailing	 on	 a	 nice	 winebuzz,	 I	 called	 the	 Nashes
from	 the	 convenience	 store,
and	 a	 quivering	 girl’s	 voice
said	 hello	 and	 then	 went
silent.	I	could	hear	breathing,
but	no	answer	to	my	requests
to	 speak	 with	 Mom	 or	 Dad.
Then	 a	 slow,	 sliding	 click
before	 the	 line	 went	 dead.	 I
decided	 to	 try	 my	 luck	 in
person.
A	boxy	disco-era	minivan
sat	in	the	Nash	driveway	next
to	 a	 rusty	 yellow	 Trans	 Am,which	 I	 assumed	 meant	 both
Bob	 and	 Betsy	 were	 home.
The	eldest	daughter	answered
the	 bell,	 but	 simply	 stood
inside	the	screen	door	staring
at	 my	 stomach	 when	 I	 asked
if	 her	 folks	 were	 home.	 The
Nashes	 were	 built	 tiny.	 This
one,	 Ashleigh,	 I	 knew	 was
twelve,	 but	 like	 the	 pudgy
boy	I’d	met	on	my	first	visit,
she	 looked	 several	 years
younger	 than	 her	 age.	 And
acted	 it.	 She	 sucked	 on	 herhair	and	hardly	blinked	when
little	 Bobby	 waddled	 next	 to
her	 and	 began	 crying	 at	 the
sight	of	me.	Then	howling.	A
good	 minute	 went	 by	 before
Betsy	Nash	came	to	the	door.
She	 looked	 as	 dazed	 as	 both
her	 children,	 and	 seemed
confused	 when	 I	 introduced
myself.
“Wind	 Gap	 don’t	 have	 a
local	daily	paper,”	she	said.
“Right,	 I’m	 from	 the
Chicago	 Daily	 Post,”	 I	 said.“Up	in	Chicago.	Illinois.”
“Well,	 my	 husband	 deals
with	purchases	like	that,”	she
said,	 and	 began	 running	 her
fingers	 through	 her	 son’s
blond	hair.
“I’m	 not	 selling	 a
subscription	or	anything....	Is
Mr.	 Nash	 home?	 Maybe	 I
could	 just	 chat	 with	 him	 real
quick?”
All	 three	 Nashes	 moved
away	from	the	door	en	masse,
and	 after	 another	 fewminutes,	 Bob	 Nash	 had	 me
ushered	 inside	 and	 was
throwing	 laundry	 off	 the
couch	 to	 make	 room	 for	 me
to	sit.
“Goddammit,	this	place	is
a	 pit,”	 he	 muttered	 loudly
toward	 his	 wife.	 “I	 apologize
for	 the	 state	 of	 our	 home,
Miss	 Preaker.	 Things	 have
kinda	 gone	 to	 hell	 ever	 since
Ann.”
“Oh,	don’t	worry	about	it
at	all,”	I	said,	pulling	a	pair	oftiny	 boys’	 undies	 from
beneath	me.	“This	is	what	my
place	looks	like	all	the	time.”
This	was	the	opposite	of	true.
One	quality	I	did	inherit	from
my	mother	was	a	compulsive
neatness.	 I	 have	 to	 stop
myself	 from	 ironing	 socks.
When	 I	 got	 back	 from	 the
hospital,	I	even	went	through
a	 period	 of	 boiling	 things:
tweezers	 and	 eyelash	 curlers,
bobby	 pins	 and	 toothbrushes.
It	 was	 an	 indulgence	 Iallowed	 myself.	 I	 ended	 up
trashing	the	tweezers,	though.
Too	many	late-night	thoughts
about	 their	 shiny,	 warm
points.	Dirty	girl,	indeed.
I	 was	 hoping	 Betsy	 Nash
would	 disappear.	 Literally.
She	 was	 so	 insubstantial,	 I
could	 imagine	 her	 slowly
evaporating,	 leaving	 only	 a
sticky	spot	on	the	edge	of	the
sofa.	 But	 she	 lingered,	 eyes
darting	 between	 me	 and	 her
husband	 before	 we	 evenbegan	speaking.	Like	she	was
winding	
up	
for	
the
conversation.	 The	 children,
too,	 hovered	 about,	 little
blonde	 ghosts	 trapped	 in	 a
limbo	 between	 indolence	 and
stupidity.	 The	 pretty	 girl
might	 do	 all	 right.	 But	 the
piggy	middle	child,	who	now
waddled	 dazedly	 into	 the
room,	was	destined	for	needy
sex	 and	 snack-cake	 bingeing.
The	 boy	 was	 the	 type	 who’d
end	up	drinking	in	gas-stationparking	 lots.	 The	 kind	 of
angry,	bored	kid	I	saw	on	my
way	into	town.
“Mr.	 Nash,	 I	 need	 to
speak	 some	 more	 with	 you
about	 Ann.	 For	 a	 larger
piece,”	 I	 started.	 “You’ve
been	 very	 kind	 with	 your
time,	and	I	was	hoping	to	get
a	little	bit	more.”
“Anything	 that	 might	 get
this	case	a	little	attention,	we
don’t	 mind,”	 he	 said.	 “What
do	you	need	to	know?”“What	 kind	 of	 games	 did
she	 like,	 what	 kind	 of	 foods
did	 she	 like?	 What	 would	 be
some	 words	 you’d	 use	 to
describe	her?	Did	she	tend	to
be	a	ringleader	or	a	follower?
Did	 she	 have	 lots	 of	 friends
or	just	a	few	close	ones?	How
did	she	like	school?	What	did
she	 do	 on	 her	 Saturdays?”
The	 Nashes	 stared	 at	 me	 in
silence	for	a	second.	“Just	for
starters,”	I	smiled.
“My	 wife	 would	 be	 theone	 to	 answer	 most	 of	 those
questions,”	 Bob	 Nash	 said.
“She’s	 the...caregiver.”	 He
turned	 to	 Betsy	 Nash,	 who
was	folding	and	refolding	the
same	dress	on	her	lap.
“She	 liked	 pizza	 and
fishsticks,”	 she	 said.	 “And
she	 had	 lots	 of	 girls	 she	 was
friendly	 with,	 but	 only	 a	 few
close	 friends,	 if	 you	 know
what	 I	 mean.	 She	 played	 by
herself	a	lot.”
“Look,	 Mommy,	 Barbieneeds	clothes,”	said	Ashleigh,
wielding	 a	 naked	 plastic	 doll
in	 front	 of	 her	 mother’s	 face.
All	 three	 of	 us	 ignored	 her,
and	 she	 tossed	 the	 toy	 to	 the
floor	 and	 began	 twirling
around	 the	 room	 in	 fake
ballerina	moves.	Seeing	a	rare
chance,	 Tiffanie	 pounced	 on
the	 Barbie	 and	 began
splaying	 the	 rubbery	 tan	 legs
open	and	shut,	open	and	shut.
“She	 was	 tough,	 she	 was
my	toughest,”	Bob	Nash	said.“She	 could	 have	 played
football	 if	 she’d	 been	 a	 boy.
She’d	knock	herself	silly	just
running	 around,	 always	 had
scrapes	and	bruises.”
“Ann	 was	 my	 mouth,”
Betsy	 said	 quietly.	 Then	 she
said	no	more.
“How	 is	 that,	 Mrs.
Nash?”
“She	 was	 a	 real	 talker,
said	 whatever	 come	 into	 her
mind.	 In	 a	 good	 way.
Mostly.”	She	was	silent	againfor	 a	 few	 beats,	 but	 I	 could
see	 her	 thinking	 back	 behind
her	 eyes	 so	 I	 said	 nothing.
“You	know,	I	thought	maybe
she’d	 be	 a	 lawyer	 or	 college
debater	
or	
something
someday,	 because	 she	 was
just...she	 never	 stopped	 to
measure	 her	 words.	 Like	 me.
I	 think	 everything	 I	 say	 is
stupid.	Ann	thought	everyone
should	 hear	 everything	 she
had	to	say.”
“You	 mentioned	 school,Miss	 Preaker,”	 interrupted
Bob	Nash.	“That’s	where	her
talkativeness	 got	 her	 in
trouble.	 She	 could	 be	 a	 little
bossy,	and	we	got	a	few	calls
from	 her	 teachers	 over	 the
years	about	her	not	taking	too
well	to	class.	She	was	a	little
wild.”
“But	 sometimes	 I	 think	 it
was	 because	 she	 was	 just	 so
smart,”	added	Betsy	Nash.
“She	 was	 whip	 smart,
yup,”	 Bob	 Nash	 nodded.“Sometimes	 I	 thought	 she
was	smarter	than	her	old	man.
Sometimes	 she	 thought	 she
was	 smarter	 than	 her	 old
man.”
“Look	 at	 me,	 Mommy!”
Piggy	Tiffanie,	who	had	been
chewing	 mindlessly	 on
Barbie’s	 toes,	 ran	 to	 the
center	of	the	living	room	and
began	 doing	 somersaults.
Ashleigh,	 seized	 by	 some
phantom	 anger,	 yelped	 at	 the
sight	 of	 her	 mother’sattention	 on	 the	 second
daughter,	and	gave	her	a	hard
shove.	 Then	 yanked	 her	 hair
emphatically	 once.	 Tiffanie’s
face	split	in	a	red	wail,	which
started	 Bobby	 Jr.	 crying
again.
“It’s	 Tiffanie’s	 fault,”
Ashleigh	 screamed,	 and
began	whimpering	also.
I	 had	 shattered	 some
delicate	
dynamic.	
A
multichild	 household	 is	 a	 pit
of	 petty	 jealousies,	 this	 Iknew,	 and	 the	 Nash	 children
were	panicking	at	the	idea	of
competing	 not	 just	 with	 one
another,	 but	 with	 a	 dead
sister.	 They	 had	 my
sympathies.
“Betsy,”	 muttered	 Bob
Nash	 quietly,	 eyebrows
slightly	raised.	Bobby	Jr.	was
quickly	 scooped	 up	 and
propped	 on	 a	 hip,	 Tiffanie
pulled	up	from	the	floor	with
one	hand,	another	arm	around
the	
now	
inconsolableAshleigh,	 and	 soon	 the	 four
were	moving	out	of	the	room.
Bob	 Nash	 stared	 after
them	a	beat.
“Been	like	that	for	almost
a	 year	 now,	 those	 girls,”	 he
said.	 “Them	 acting	 like	 little
babies.	 Thought	 they	 were
supposed	 to	 be	 anxious	 to
grow	 up.	 Ann	 being	 gone
changes	 this	 home	 more
than...”	 He	 shifted	 on	 the
sofa.	“It’s	just	that	she	was	a
real	 person,	 you	 know?	 Youthink:	 Nine	 years	 old,	 what’s
that?	 What’s	 there?	 But	 Ann
had	 a	 personality.	 I	 could
guess	 what	 she’d	 think	 about
things.	I	knew,	when	we	were
watching	 TV,	 what	 stuff
she’d	 think	 was	 funny	 and
what	 stuff	 she’d	 think	 was
dumb.	I	can’t	do	that	with	my
other	 kids.	 Hell,	 I	 can’t	 do
that	 with	 my	 wife.	 Ann,	 you
just	 felt	 her	 there.	 I	 just...”
Bob	Nash’s	throat	shut	up	on
him.	 He	 stood	 and	 turnedaway	 from	 me,	 turned	 back
once,	then	away,	walked	in	a
circle	 behind	 the	 couch,	 then
stood	 in	 front	 of	 me.
“Goddammit,	 I	 want	 her
back.	 I	 mean,	 what	 now?	 Is
this	 it?”	 He	 threw	 his	 hand
around	 the	 room,	 toward	 the
doorway	 where	 his	 wife	 and
kids	 had	 exited.	 “Because	 if
this	 is	 it,	 there	 ain’t	 much
point	 is	 there?	 And
goddammit,	 someone	 needs
to	 find	 that	 man,	 because	 heneeds	to	tell	me:	Why	Ann?	I
need	 to	 know	 that.	 She	 was
the	 one	 I’d	 always	 thought
would	do	ok.”
I	 sat	 quiet	 for	 a	 second,
could	 feel	 my	 pulse	 in	 my
neck.
“Mr.	 Nash,	 it	 has	 been
suggested	 to	 me	 that	 maybe
Ann’s	personality,	which	you
mention	 was	 very	 strong,
might	 have	 rubbed	 some
people	 the	 wrong	 way.	 Do
you	 think	 that	 could	 haveanything	to	do	with	this?”
I	could	feel	him	get	wary
on	me,	see	it	in	the	way	he	sat
down	 and	 deliberately	 leaned
back	 onto	 the	 couch,	 spread
his	 arms	 and	 pretended	 to	 be
casual.
“Rubbed	 who	 the	 wrong
way?”
“Well,	 I	 understand	 there
were	 troubles	 about	 Ann	 and
a	 neighbor’s	 bird?	 That	 she
may	 have	 hurt	 a	 neighbor’s
bird?”Bob	 Nash	 rubbed	 his
eyes,	looked	at	his	feet.
“God,	 people	 gossip	 in
this	 town.	 No	 one	 ever
proved	Ann	did	that.	She	and
the	neighbors	already	had	bad
blood.	 Joe	 Duke	 across	 the
way.	 His	 girls,	 they’re	 older,
they	 messed	 with	 Ann	 a	 lot,
teased	 her	 a	 lot.	 Then	 they
have	her	over	to	play	one	day.
I	 don’t	 really	 know	 what
happened,	 but	 by	 the	 time
Ann	got	back	here,	they	wereall	screaming	that	she’d	killed
their	 goddam	 bird.”	 He
laughed,	
shrugged	
his
shoulders.	 “Be	 fine	 by	 me	 if
she	 had,	 it	 was	 a	 noisy	 old
thing.”
“Do	you	think	Ann	would
be	likely	to	do	something	like
that,	if	provoked?”
“Well,	 it	 was	 a	 fool	 who
provoked	Ann,”	he	said.	“She
didn’t	 take	 that	 kind	 of	 thing
well.	 She	 wasn’t	 exactly	 a
little	lady.”“Do	 you	 think	 she	 knew
the	person	who	killed	her?”
Nash	picked	up	a	pink	T-
shirt	 from	 the	 sofa,	 folded	 it
in	 squares	 like	 a	 kerchief.
“Used	 to	 think	 no.	 Now,	 I
think	 yes.	 I	 think	 she	 went
with	someone	she	knew.”
“Would	 she	 be	 more
likely	 to	 go	 with	 a	 man	 or	 a
woman?”	I	asked.
“So	 you	 heard	 the	 James
Capisi	story?”
I	nodded.“Well,	a	little	girl	is	more
likely	 to	 trust	 a	 person	 who
reminds	 her	 of	 her	 momma,
right?”
Depends	 on	 what	 her
momma’s	like,	I	thought.
“But	 I	 still	 think	 it’s	 a
man.	 Can’t	 picture	 a	 woman
doing	 all...that	 to	 a	 baby.	 I
hear	John	Keene	has	no	alibi.
Maybe	 he	 wanted	 to	 kill	 a
little	girl,	saw	Natalie	all	day
every	 day,	 and	 couldn’t	 take
it,	 the	 urge,	 so	 he	 went	 outand	 killed	 another	 little
tomboy,	 girl	 kind	 of	 like
Natalie.	 But	 then	 in	 the	 end
he	 couldn’t	 resist,	 took
Natalie	too.”
“Is	that	the	talk?”	I	asked.
“Some	of	it,	I	s’pose.”
Betsy	 Nash	 appeared
suddenly	 in	 the	 doorway.
Looking	 down	 at	 her	 knees,
she	 said,	 “Bob.	 Adora	 is
here.”	 My	 stomach	 clenched
without	my	permission.
My	 mother	 breezed	 in,smelling	 like	 bright	 blue
water.	 She	 looked	 more
comfortable	 in	 the	 Nash
house	 than	 Mrs.	 Nash	 did.	 It
was	 a	 natural	 gift	 for	 Adora,
making	 other	 women	 feel
incidental.	Betsy	Nash	retired
from	 the	 room,	 like	 some
maid	 from	 a	 1930s	 movie.
My	mother	refused	to	look	at
me,	 but	 went	 straight	 to	 Bob
Nash.
“Bob,	Betsy	told	me	there
was	 a	 reporter	 here,	 and	 Iknew	 right	 then	 it	 was	 my
daughter.	I’m	so	sorry.	I	can’t
apologize	 enough	 for	 the
intrusion.”
Bob	Nash	stared	at	Adora,
then	 at	 me.	 “This	 is	 your
daughter?	I	had	no	idea.”
“No,	
probably	
not.
Camille’s	 not	 the	 family
type.”
“Why	 didn’t	 you	 say
anything?”	Nash	asked	me.
“I	 told	 you	 I	 was	 from
Wind	 Gap.	 I	 had	 no	 ideayou’d	 be	 interested	 in	 who
my	mother	was.”
“Oh,	I’m	not	angry,	don’t
get	 me	 wrong.	 It’s	 just	 that
your	 mother	 is	 a	 very	 good
friend	to	us,”	he	said,	as	if	she
were	 some	 big-hearted
patron.	 “She	 tutored	 Ann	 in
English	 and	 spelling.	 Your
mother	 and	 Ann	 were	 very
close.	 Ann	 was	 very	 proud
she	had	an	adult	friend.”
My	 mother	 sat	 with	 her
hands	 folded	 in	 her	 lap,	 skirtspread	 out	 along	 the	 couch,
and	blinked	at	me.	I	felt	as	if	I
were	being	warned	not	to	say
something,	 but	 I	 didn’t	 know
what.
“I	 had	 no	 idea,”	 I	 finally
said.	 True.	 I’d	 thought	 my
mother	 was	 overplaying	 her
mourning,	 pretending	 to
know	 those	 girls.	 Now	 I	 was
surprised	at	how	subtle	she’d
been.	 But	 why	 in	 the	 world
was	 she	 tutoring	 Ann?	 She’d
done	 the	 mother’s-aide	 thingat	 my	 school	 when	 I	 was	 a
kid—mainly	 to	 spend	 time
with	 other	 Wind	 Gap
housewives—but	 I	 couldn’t
picture	 her	 noblesse	 oblige
extending	
to	
spending
afternoons	 with	 a	 unkempt
girl	 from	 the	 west	 side	 of
town.	
Occasionally	
I
underestimated	 Adora.	 I
suppose.
“Camille,	 I	 think	 you
should	 leave,”	 Adora	 said.
“I’m	here	on	a	social	visit	andit’s	 difficult	 for	 me	 to	 relax
around	you	these	days.”
“I’m	 not	 quite	 done
talking	with	Mr.	Nash.”
“Yes,	 you	 are.”	 Adora
looked	
at	
Nash	
for
confirmation,	 and	 he	 smiled
awkwardly,	 like	 someone
staring	down	the	sun.
“Maybe	 we	 can	 pick	 this
up	 later,	 Miss...Camille.”	 A
word	suddenly	flashed	on	my
lower	hip:	punish.	I	could	feel
it	getting	hot.“Thanks	 for	 your	 time,
Mr.	 Nash,”	 I	 said,	 and	 strode
out	 of	 the	 room,	 not	 looking
at	my	mother.	I	began	crying
before	 I’d	 even	 reached	 my
car.	
Chapter	Seven
Once	I	was	standing	on	a
cold	 corner	 in	 Chicago
waiting	for	the	light	to	change
when	 a	 blind	 man	 came
clicking	 up.	 What	 are	 the
cross	 streets	 here,	 he	 asked,
and	 when	 I	 didn’t	 reply	 he
turned	toward	me	and	said,	Is
anybody	there?
I’m	here,	I	said,	and	it	felt
shockingly	 comforting,	 thosewords.	When	I’m	panicked,	I
say	them	aloud	to	myself.	I’m
here.	I	don’t	usually	feel	that
I	 am.	 I	 feel	 like	 a	 warm	 gust
of	wind	could	exhale	my	way
and	 I’d	 be	 disappeared
forever,	 not	 even	 a	 sliver	 of
fingernail	 left	 behind.	 On
some	days,	I	find	this	thought
calming;	 on	 others	 it	 chills
me.
My	
sense	
of
weightlessness,	 I	 think,
comes	 from	 the	 fact	 that	 Iknow	 so	 little	 about	 my	 past
—or	 at	 least	 that’s	 what	 the
shrinks	 at	 the	 clinic	 came	 up
with.	I’ve	long	since	given	up
trying	 to	 discover	 anything
about	my	dad;	when	I	picture
him,	it’s	as	a	generic	“father”
image.	 I	 can’t	 stand	 to	 think
about	him	too	specifically,	to
imagine	 him	 shopping	 for
groceries	 or	 having	 a	 cup	 of
morning	 coffee,	 coming
home	to	kids.	Will	I	someday
run	 smack	 into	 a	 girl	 wholooks	 like	 me?	 As	 a	 child,	 I
struggled	 to	 find	 a	 solid
resemblance	 between	 my
mother	and	myself,	some	link
that	would	prove	I	came	from
her.	 I’d	 study	 her	 when	 she
wasn’t	 looking,	 steal	 the
framed	 portraits	 from	 her
room	 and	 try	 to	 convince
myself	 I	 had	 her	 eyes.	 Or
maybe	 it	 was	 something	 not
in	the	face.	The	turn	of	a	calf
or	the	hollow	of	my	neck.
She	 never	 even	 told	 mehow	 she’d	 met	 Alan.	 What	 I
know	of	their	story	has	come
from	 other	 people.	 Questions
are	 discouraged,	 considered
prying.	I	remember	the	shock
of	 hearing	 my	 college
roommate	 talk	 to	 her	 mother
on	 the	 phone:	 The	 detailed
minutia,	 her	 lack	 of
censorship	 seemed	 decadent.
She	 would	 say	 silly	 things,
like	 how	 she	 forgot	 she’d
enrolled	 for	 a	 class—
completely	 forgot	 she	 wassupposed	to	be	in	Geography
101	 three	 days	 a	 week—and
she’d	 say	 it	 in	 the	 same
boastful	
tone	
of	
a
kindergartner	with	a	gold-star
crayon	drawing.
I	
remember	
finally
meeting	 her	 mom,	 how	 she
zipped	 around	 our	 suite
asking	 so	 many	 questions,
knowing	 already	 so	 much
about	 me.	 She	 gave	 Alison	 a
big	 plastic	 bag	 of	 safety	 pins
that	 she	 thought	 might	 comein	 handy,	 and	 when	 they	 left
for	 lunch,	 I	 surprised	 myself
by	 bursting	 into	 tears.	 The
gesture—so	random	and	kind
—baffled	 me.	 Is	 this	 what
mothers	 did,	 wonder	 if	 you
might	need	safety	pins?	Mine
phoned	 once	 a	 month	 and
always	 asked	 the	 same
practical	 questions	 (grades,
classes,	upcoming	expenses).
As	 a	 child,	 I	 don’t
remember	 ever	 telling	 Adora
my	favorite	color,	or	what	I’dlike	 to	 name	 my	 daughter
when	I	grew	up.	I	don’t	think
she	 ever	 knew	 my	 favorite
dish,	 and	 I	 certainly	 never
padded	 down	 to	 her	 room	 in
the	 early-morning	 hours,
teary	 from	 nightmares.	 I
always	 feel	 sad	 for	 the	 girl
that	 I	 was,	 because	 it	 never
occurred	 to	 me	 that	 my
mother	 might	 comfort	 me.
She	 has	 never	 told	 me	 she
loved	 me,	 and	 I	 never
assumed	 she	 did.	 She	 tendedto	me.	She	administrated	me.
Oh,	 yes,	 and	 one	 time	 she
bought	 me	 lotion	 with
vitamin	E.
For	 a	 while	 I	 convinced
myself	 that	 Adora’s	 distance
was	 a	 defense	 constructed
after	 Marian.	 But	 in	 truth,	 I
think	 she’s	 always	 had	 more
problems	 with	 children	 than
she’d	 ever	 admit.	 I	 think,	 in
fact,	 she	 hates	 them.	 There’s
a	 jealousy,	 a	 resentfulness
that	 I	 can	 feel	 even	 now,	 inmy	 memory.	 At	 one	 point,
she	probably	liked	the	idea	of
a	 daughter.	 When	 she	 was	 a
girl,	 I	 bet	 she	 daydreamed	 of
being	 a	 mother,	 of	 coddling,
of	 licking	 her	 child	 like	 a
milk-swelled	cat.	She	has	that
voraciousness	about	children.
She	swoops	in	on	them.	Even
I,	 in	 public,	 was	 a	 beloved
child.	 Once	 her	 period	 of
mourning	 for	 Marian	 was
over,	 she’d	 parade	 me	 into
town,	smiling	and	teasing	me,tickling	me	as	she	spoke	with
people	 on	 the	 sidewalks.
When	 we	 got	 home,	 she’d
trail	 off	 to	 her	 room	 like	 an
unfinished	 sentence,	 and	 I
would	 sit	 outside	 with	 my
face	 pressed	 against	 her	 door
and	 replay	 the	 day	 in	 my
head,	 searching	 for	 clues	 to
what	 I’d	 done	 to	 displease
her.
I	 have	 one	 memory	 that
catches	 in	 me	 like	 a	 nasty
clump	 of	 blood.	 Marian	 wasdead	about	two	years,	and	my
mother	 had	 a	 cluster	 of
friends	 come	 over	 for
afternoon	drinks.	One	of	them
brought	a	baby.	For	hours,	the
child	 was	 cooed	 over,
smothered	 with	 red-lipstick
kisses,	 tidied	 up	 with	 tissues,
then	lipstick	smacked	again.	I
was	supposed	to	be	reading	in
my	 room,	 but	 I	 sat	 at	 the	 top
of	the	stairs	watching.
My	 mother	 finally	 was
handed	 the	 baby,	 and	 shecuddled	 it	 ferociously.	 Oh,
how	wonderful	it	is	to	hold	a
baby	 again!	 Adora	 jiggled	 it
on	her	knee,	walked	it	around
the	 rooms,	 whispered	 to	 it,
and	 I	 looked	 down	 from
above	 like	 a	 spiteful	 little
god,	 the	 back	 of	 my	 hand
placed	 against	 my	 face,
imagining	 how	 it	 felt	 to	 be
cheek	 to	 cheek	 with	 my
mother.
When	the	ladies	went	into
the	kitchen	to	help	tidy	up	thedishes,	 something	 changed.	 I
remember	 my	 mother,	 alone
in	 the	 living	 room,	 staring	 at
the	 child	 almost	 lasciviously.
She	 pressed	 her	 lips	 hard
against	the	baby’s	apple	slice
of	 a	 cheek.	 Then	 she	 opened
her	mouth	just	slightly,	took	a
tiny	 bit	 of	 flesh	 between	 her
teeth,	and	gave	it	a	little	bite.
The	 baby	 wailed.	 The
blotch	 faded	 as	 Adora
snuggled	 the	 child,	 and	 told
the	 other	 women	 it	 was	 justbeing	fussy.	I	ran	to	Marian’s
room	 and	 got	 under	 the
covers.
	
Back	 at	 Footh’s	 for	 a
drink	after	my	mother	and	the
Nashes.	 I	 was	 boozing	 too
much,	 but	 never	 to	 the	 point
of	 drunkenness,	 I	 reasoned
with	 myself.	 I	 needed	 just	 a
nip.	 I’ve	 always	 been	 partial
to	 the	 image	 of	 liquor	 as
lubrication—a	 layer	 of
protection	 from	 all	 the	 sharpthoughts	 in	 your	 head.	 The
barkeep	 was	 a	 round-faced
guy	 two	 classes	 behind	 me
who	 I	 was	 pretty	 sure	 was
named	 Barry	 but	 not	 sure
enough	 to	 actually	 call	 him
that.	 He	 muttered,	 “Welcome
back,”	 as	 he	 filled	 my	 Big
Mouth	 cup	 two-thirds	 full	 of
bourbon,	splashed	some	coke
on	 top.	 “On	 the	 house,”	 he
said	 to	 the	 napkin	 holder.
“We	 don’t	 take	 money	 from
pretty	women	here.”	His	neckshot	 red,	 and	 he	 suddenly
pretended	 he	 had	 urgent
business	 at	 the	 other	 end	 of
the	counter.
	
I	took	Neeho	Drive	on	the
way	back	to	the	house.	It	was
a	street	several	of	my	friends
had	 lived	 on,	 slicing	 through
town	
and	
growing
increasingly	 more	 posh	 as	 it
neared	 Adora’s.	 I	 spotted
Katie	 Lacey’s	 old	 home,	 a
flimsy	 mansion	 her	 parentsbuilt	 when	 we	 were	 ten—
after	they’d	smashed	their	old
Victorian	into	shards.
A	 block	 ahead	 of	 me,	 a
little	 girl	 on	 a	 golf	 cart
decorated	with	flower	stickers
putt-putted	 along.	 She	 wore
her	 hair	 in	 elaborate	 braids
like	 a	 little	 Swiss	 maid	 on	 a
cocoa	 box.	 Amma.	 She’d
taken	 advantage	 of	 Adora’s
visit	to	the	Nashes	to	make	an
escape—girls	 traveling	 solo
were	 an	 oddity	 in	 Wind	 Gapsince	Natalie’s	killing.
Rather	 than	 continue
home,	 she	 turned	 and	 headed
east,	 which	 meant	 dirtbox
houses	 and	 the	 pig	 farm.	 I
turned	 the	 corner	 and
followed	 her	 so	 slowly	 I
almost	stalled	out.
The	 route	 offered	 a	 nice
downhill	 slope	 for	 Amma,
and	the	cart	glided	so	fast	her
braids	flew	out	behind	her.	In
ten	 minutes,	 we	 were	 in	 the
country.	 Tall	 yellow	 grassesand	 bored	 cows.	 Barns
leaning	like	old	men.	I	let	the
car	 idle	 for	 a	 few	 minutes	 to
give	Amma	a	good	head	start,
then	 drove	 just	 far	 enough	 to
keep	her	in	sight.	I	trailed	her
past	 farmhouses	 and	 a
roadside	 walnut	 stand	 that
was	 manned	 by	 a	 boy	 who
held	 his	 cigarette	 jaunty	 as	 a
movie	 star.	 Soon	 the	 air
smelled	 like	 shit	 and	 stale
saliva	 and	 I	 knew	 where	 we
were	 heading.	 Another	 tenminutes	 and	 the	 metal	 pig
holds	 came	 into	 sight,	 long
and	 glinty	 like	 rows	 of
staples.	The	squeals	made	my
ears	 sweat.	 Like	 screams
from	 a	 rusty	 well	 pump.	 My
nose	 flared	 involuntarily	 and
my	 eyes	 started	 watering.
You	 ever	 been	 near	 an
animal-processing	 plant,	 you
know	what	I	mean.	The	smell
isn’t	 like	 water	 or	 air;	 it’s	 a
solid.	Like	you	should	be	able
to	 cut	 a	 hole	 in	 the	 stink	 toget	some	relief.	You	can’t.
Amma	zipped	through	the
gates	of	the	plant.	The	guy	at
the	booth	just	waved	at	her.	I
had	a	tougher	time	until	I	said
the	magic	word:	Adora.
“Right.	 Adora’s	 got	 a
grown-up	
daughter.	
I
remember,”	 said	 the	 old	 guy.
His	nametag	said	Jose.	I	tried
to	 see	 if	 he	 was	 missing	 any
fingers.	 Mexicans	 don’t	 get
cushy	box	jobs	unless	they’re
owed.	 That’s	 the	 way	 plantsdown	 here	 work:	 The
Mexicans	 get	 the	 shittiest,
most	 dangerous	 jobs,	 and	 the
whites	still	complain.
Amma	 parked	 her	 cart
next	 to	 a	 pickup	 and	 dusted
herself	 off.	 Then,	 with	 a
businesslike	 beeline,	 she
walked	 straight	 past	 the
slaughtering	 house,	 past	 the
lines	 of	 pig	 holds,	 those	 wet
pink	
snouts	
squirming
between	the	air	slats,	and	to	a
big	 metal	 barn	 of	 a	 buildingwhere	 the	 nursing	 happens.
Most	 sows	 are	 repeatedly
inseminated,	 brood	 after
brood,	 till	 their	 bodies	 give
way	and	they	go	to	slaughter.
But	while	they’re	still	useful,
they’re	 made	 to	 nurse—
strapped	 to	 their	 sides	 in	 a
farrowing	 crate,	 legs	 apart,
nipples	 exposed.	 Pigs	 are
extremely	 smart,	 sociable
creatures,	 and	 this	 forced
assembly-line	
intimacy
makes	the	nursing	sows	wantto	die.	Which,	as	soon	as	they
dry	up,	they	do.
Even	 the	 idea	 of	 this
practice	 I	 find	 repulsive.	 But
the	 sight	 of	 it	 actually	 does
something	to	you,	makes	you
less	 human.	 Like	 watching	 a
rape	 and	 saying	 nothing.	 I
saw	 Amma	 at	 the	 far	 end	 of
the	barn,	standing	at	the	edge
of	 one	 metal	 farrowing	 crate.
A	 few	 men	 were	 pulling	 one
pack	 of	 squealing	 piglets	 out
of	 the	 stall,	 throwing	 anotherpack	 in.	 I	 moved	 to	 the	 far
side	 of	 the	 barn	 so	 I	 could
stand	 behind	 Amma	 without
her	 seeing	 me.	 The	 pig	 lay
nearly	 comatose	 on	 its	 side,
its	 belly	 exposed	 between
metal	 bars,	 red,	 bloody
nipples	 pointing	 out	 like
fingers.	 One	 of	 the	 men
rubbed	oil	on	the	goriest	one,
then	 flicked	 it	 and	 giggled.
They	 paid	 no	 attention	 to
Amma,	 as	 if	 it	 were	 quite
normal	 that	 she	 was	 there.She	 winked	 at	 one	 as	 they
snapped	 another	 sow	 in	 a
crate	and	drove	off	to	get	the
next	pack.
The	 piglets	 in	 the	 stall
were	 swarming	 over	 the	 sow
like	 ants	 on	 a	 glob	 of	 jelly.
The	nipples	were	fought	over,
bouncing	 in	 and	 out	 of
mouths,	 jiggling	 tautly	 like
rubber.	The	sow’s	eyes	rolled
up	 into	 her	 head.	 Amma	 sat
down	cross-legged	and	gazed,
fascinated.	After	five	minutesshe	was	in	the	same	position,
now	smiling	and	squirming.	I
had	 to	 leave.	 I	 walked,	 first
slowly,	 then	 broke	 into	 a
scramble	 to	 my	 car.	 Door
shut,	 radio	 blasting,	 warm
bourbon	stinging	my	throat,	I
drove	 away	 from	 the	 stink
and	sound.	And	that	child.	
Chapter	Eight
Amma.	 All	 this	 time	 I’d
had	 little	 real	 interest	 in	 her.
Now	I	did.	What	I	saw	at	the
farm	kept	my	throat	clenched.
My	 mother	 said	 she	 was	 the
most	 popular	 girl	 in	 school,
and	 I	 believed	 it.	 Jackie	 said
she	 was	 the	 meanest,	 and	 I
believed	 that,	 too.	 Living	 in
the	 swirl	 of	 Adora’s
bitterness	 had	 to	 make	 one	 abit	 crooked.	 And	 what	 did
Amma	 make	 of	 Marian,	 I
wondered?	How	confusing	to
live	 in	 the	 shadow	 of	 a
shadow.	 But	 Amma	 was	 a
smart	girl—she	did	her	acting
out	 away	 from	 home.	 Near
Adora	 she	 was	 compliant,
sweet,	 needy—just	 what	 she
had	to	be,	to	get	my	mother’s
love.
But	 that	 violent	 streak—
the	 tantrum,	 the	 smacking	 of
her	 friend,	 and	 now	 thisugliness.	 A	 penchant	 for
doing	and	seeing	nasty	things.
It	 suddenly	 reminded	 me	 of
the	 stories	 about	 Ann	 and
Natalie.	 Amma	 wasn’t	 like
Marian,	but	maybe	she	was	a
little	bit	like	them.
	
It	was	late	afternoon,	just
before	 suppertime,	 and	 I
decided	 to	 make	 a	 second
pass	at	the	Keenes.	I	needed	a
quote	 for	 my	 feature	 piece
and	if	I	couldn’t	get	it,	Currywas	 going	 to	 pull	 me	 out.
Leaving	 Wind	 Gap	 would
cause	 me	 no	 pain	 personally,
but	I	needed	to	prove	I	could
handle	 myself,	 especially
with	 my	 credibility	 faltering.
A	girl	who	slices	herself	open
isn’t	 the	 first	 on	 the	 list	 for
tough	assignments.
I	 drove	 past	 the	 spot
where	 Natalie’s	 body	 was
discovered.	 What	 Amma
deemed	 unworthy	 of	 stealing
sat	 in	 a	 sad	 clump:	 threestumpy	 candles,	 long	 since
blown	 out,	 along	 with	 cheap
flowers	 still	 in	 their
supermarket	 wrappers.	 A
limp	 helium	 balloon	 in	 the
shape	 of	 a	 heart	 bobbing
listlessly.
In	 the	 driveway	 outside
the	 Keene	 home,	 Natalie’s
brother	 sat	 in	 the	 passenger
seat	 of	 a	 red	 convertible
talking	with	a	blonde	girl	who
almost	 matched	 his	 beauty.	 I
parked	 behind	 them,	 sawthem	 sneak	 quick	 looks,	 then
pretend	not	to	notice	me.	The
girl	
began	
laughing
animatedly,	 weaving	 her	 red-
lacquered	 nails	 through	 the
back	of	the	boy’s	dark	hair.	I
gave	 them	 a	 quick,	 awkward
nod,	 which	 I’m	 sure	 they
didn’t	 see,	 and	 slipped	 past
them	to	the	front	door.
Natalie’s	
mother
answered.	 Behind	 her	 the
house	 was	 dark	 and	 quiet.
Her	 face	 stayed	 open;	 shedidn’t	recognize	me.
“Mrs.	 Keene,	 I	 am	 so
sorry	 to	 bother	 you	 at	 a	 time
like	 this,	 but	 I	 really	 need	 to
talk	with	you.”
“About	Natalie?”
“Yes,	 may	 I	 come	 in?”	 It
was	a	nasty	trick	to	sneak	my
way	 into	 her	 home	 without
identifying	 myself.	 Reporters
are	like	vampires,	Curry	likes
to	 say.	 They	 can’t	 come	 into
your	 home	 without	 your
invitation,	 but	 once	 they’rethere,	you	won’t	get	them	out
till	 they’ve	 sucked	 you	 dry.
She	opened	the	door.
“Oh,	it	feels	nice	and	cool
in	 here,	 thanks,”	 I	 said.	 “It
was	 supposed	 to	 peak	 at
ninety	 today,	 but	 I	 think	 we
passed	that.”
“I	heard	ninety-five.”
“I	 believe	 it.	 Could	 I
trouble	 you	 for	 a	 glass	 of
water?”	
Another	
time-
honored	 ploy:	 A	 woman	 is
less	likely	to	throw	you	out	ifshe’s	 offered	 her	 hospitality.
If	 you	 have	 allergies	 or	 a
cold,	 asking	 for	 a	 tissue	 is
even	 better.	 Women	 love
vulnerability.	Most	women.
“Of	 course.”	 She	 paused,
looking	 at	 me,	 as	 if	 she	 felt
she	 should	 know	 who	 I	 was
and	 was	 too	 embarrassed	 to
ask.	 Morticians,	 priests,
police,	 medics,	 mourners—
she’d	 probably	 met	 more
people	 in	 the	 past	 few	 days
than	 she	 had	 the	 previousyear.
While	
Mrs.	
Keene
disappeared	into	the	kitchen,	I
peered	 around.	 The	 room
looked	 completely	 different
today,	 with	 furniture	 moved
back	 into	 the	 proper	 places.
On	a	table	not	far	away	sat	a
photo	 of	 the	 two	 Keene
children.	 They	 were	 each
leaning	on	a	side	of	a	big	oak
tree,	 dressed	 in	 jeans	 and	 red
sweaters.	 He	 was	 smiling
uncomfortably,	 like	 he	 wasdoing	 something	 best	 left
undocumented.	 She	 was
maybe	 half	 his	 height,	 and
looked	 determinedly	 serious,
like	 the	 subject	 of	 an	 old
daguerreotype.
“What’s	 your	 son’s
name?”
“That’s	John.	He’s	a	very
kind,	 gentle	 boy.	 I’ve	 always
been	proudest	of	that.	He	just
graduated	from	high	school.”
“They	 bumped	 it	 up	 a
little—when	I	went	to	schoolhere,	 they	 made	 us	 wait	 till
June.”
“Mmmm.	 Nice	 to	 have
the	longer	summers.”
I	smiled.	She	smiled.	I	sat
down	and	sipped	my	water.	I
couldn’t	 remember	 what
Curry	 advised	 once	 you
tricked	 your	 way	 into
someone’s	living	room.
“We	 actually	 haven’t
properly	 met.	 I’m	 Camille
Preaker.	 From	 the	 Chicago
Daily	Post?	We	spoke	brieflyon	the	phone	the	other	night.”
She	 stopped	 smiling.	 Her
jaw	started	working.
“You	 should	 have	 said
that	before.”
“I	 know	 what	 a	 horrible
time	 this	 is	 for	 you,	 and	 if	 I
could	 just	 ask	 you	 a	 few
questions...”
“You	may	not.”
“Mrs.	 Keene,	 we	 want	 to
be	 fair	 to	 your	 family,	 that’s
why	 I’m	 here.	 The	 more
information	 we	 can	 givepeople...”
“The	more	papers	you	can
sell.	 I’m	 sick	 and	 tired	 of	 all
this.	 Now	 I	 will	 tell	 you	 one
last	 time:	 Do	 not	 come	 back
here.	Do	not	try	to	contact	us.
I	 have	 absolutely	 nothing	 to
say	 to	 you.”	 She	 stood	 over
me,	 leaned	 down.	 She	 wore,
as	 she	 had	 at	 the	 funeral,	 a
beaded	 necklace	 made	 of
wood,	with	a	big	red	heart	at
its	center.	It	bobbed	back	and
forth	 off	 her	 bosom	 like	 ahypnotist’s	 watch.	 “I	 think
you	 are	 a	 parasite,”	 she	 spat
at	 me.	 “I	 think	 you	 are
disgusting.	 I	 hope	 someday
you	 look	 back	 and	 see	 how
ugly	 you	 are.	 Now	 please
leave.”
She	 trailed	 me	 to	 the
door,	 as	 if	 she	 wouldn’t
believe	I	was	truly	gone	until
she	 saw	 me	 step	 outside	 her
home.	 She	 closed	 the	 door
behind	me	with	enough	force
to	 make	 her	 doorbell	 chimelightly.
I	 stood	 on	 the	 stoop
blushing,	 thinking	 to	 myself
what	 a	 nice	 detail	 that	 heart
necklace	 would	 make	 in	 my
story,	 and	 saw	 the	 girl	 in	 the
red	convertible	staring	at	me.
The	boy	was	gone.
“You’re	 Camille	 Preaker,
right?”	she	called	out.
“Yes.”
“I	 remember	 you,”	 the
girl	 said.	 “I	 was	 just	 a	 little
thing	 when	 you	 lived	 here,but	we	all	knew	you.”
“What’s	your	name?”
“Meredith	 Wheeler.	 You
wouldn’t	remember	me,	I	was
just	a	little	goofball	when	you
were	in	high	school.”
John	 Keene’s	 girlfriend.
Her	 name	 was	 familiar,
thanks	 to	 my	 mother’s
friends,	 but	 I	 wouldn’t	 have
remembered	 her	 personally.
Hell,	 she’d	 have	 been	 all	 of
six	 or	 seven	 last	 time	 I	 lived
here.	 Still,	 I	 wasn’t	 surprisedshe	 knew	 me.	 Girls	 growing
up	 in	 Wind	 Gap	 studied	 the
older	 girls	 obsessively:	 who
dated	 the	 football	 stars,	 who
was	homecoming	queen,	who
mattered.	
You	
traded
favorites	like	baseball	cards.	I
still	remember	CeeCee	Wyatt,
Calhoon	 High	 prom	 queen
from	when	I	was	a	girl.	I	once
bought	 eleven	 drugstore
lipsticks	 trying	 to	 find	 the
exact	shade	of	pink	she	wore
when	she	said	hello	to	me	onemorning.
“I	remember	you,”	I	said.
“I	 can’t	 believe	 you’re
driving.”
She	 laughed,	 seemed
pleased	by	my	lie.
“You’re	 a	 reporter	 now,
right?”
“Yes,	in	Chicago.”
“I’ll	 get	 John	 to	 talk	 to
you.	We’ll	be	in	touch.”
Meredith	 zipped	 away.
I’m	sure	she	felt	quite	pleased
with	 herself—We’ll	 be	 intouch—reapplying	 her	 lip
gloss	 and	 thinking	 not	 at	 all
of	 the	 dead	 ten-year-old	 that
was	 to	 be	 the	 subject	 of
conversation.
I	 phoned	 the	 main
hardware	 store	 in	 town—the
one	where	Natalie’s	body	had
been	
found.	
Without
identifying	 myself,	 I	 began
chatting	about	maybe	redoing
a	 bathroom,	 maybe	 getting
new	 tiles.	 Not	 too	 hard	 to
steer	 the	 conversation	 to	 thekillings.	 I	 suppose	 a	 lot	 of
people	 have	 been	 rethinking
their	 home	 security	 lately,	 I
suggested.
“That’s	 a	 fact,	 ma’am.
We’ve	 had	 a	 run	 on	 chain
locks	 and	 double	 bolts	 in	 the
past	 few	 days,”	 said	 the
grumbly	voice.
“Really?	How	many	have
you	gone	through?”
“About	 three	 dozen,	 I’d
guess.”
“Mostly	 families?	 Peoplewith	children?”
“Oh,	 yeah.	 They’re	 the
ones	 got	 reason	 to	 worry,
right?	 Horrible	 thing.	 We’re
hoping	 to	 make	 some	 sort	 of
donation	 to	 little	 Natalie’s
family.”	 He	 paused.	 “You
want	 to	 come	 down,	 look	 at
some	tile	samples?”
“I	 might	 just	 do	 that,
thanks.”
One	more	reporting	chore
off	my	list,	and	I	didn’t	even
have	 to	 subject	 myself	 tonamecalling	 from	 a	 grieving
mother.
	
For	 our	 dinner	 meeting,
Richard	 picked	 Gritty’s,	 a
“family	 restaurant”	 with	 a
salad	 bar	 that	 featured	 every
kind	 of	 food	 but	 salad.	 The
lettuce	 always	 sat	 in	 a	 small
container	at	the	end,	a	greasy,
pale	 afterthought.	 Richard
was	 chatting	 up	 the	 jolly-fat
hostess	 when	 I	 flustered	 in
twelve	minutes	late.	The	girl,whose	 face	 matched	 the	 pies
revolving	 in	 the	 case	 behind
her,	didn’t	seem	to	notice	me
hovering.	 She	 was	 immersed
in	the	possibilities	of	Richard:
In	 her	 head,	 she	 was	 already
writing	her	diary	entry	for	the
night.
“Preaker,”	 he	 said,	 eyes
still	 on	 the	 girl.	 “Your
tardiness	is	a	scandal.	You’re
lucky	JoAnn	was	here	to	keep
me	 company.”	 The	 girl
giggled,	 then	 glared	 at	 me,leading	 us	 to	 a	 corner	 booth
where	 she	 slapped	 a	 greasy
menu	 in	 front	 of	 me.	 On	 the
table,	 I	 could	 still	 see	 the
outline	 of	 the	 previous
customer’s	glassware.
The	 waitress	 appeared,
slid	 me	 a	 glass	 of	 water	 the
size	 of	 a	 shot,	 then	 handed
Richard	 a	 styrofoam	 trough
of	soda	pop.	“Hey	Richard—I
remembered,	see?”
“That’s	 why	 you’re	 my
favorite	 waitress,	 Kathy.”Cute.
“Hi,	Camille;	I	heard	you
were	 in	 town.”	 I	 didn’t	 want
to	hear	that	phrase	ever	again.
The	 waitress,	 upon	 second
look,	 was	 a	 former	 classmate
of	 mine.	 We’d	 been	 friends
for	 a	 semester	 sophomore
year	because	we’d	dated	best
buddies—mine	was	Phil,	hers
was	 Jerry—jock	 guys	 who
played	football	in	the	fall	and
wrestled	 in	 the	 winter,	 and
threw	 parties	 year-round	 inPhil’s	 basement	 rec	 room.	 I
had	 a	 flash	 memory	 of	 us
holding	 hands	 for	 balance
while	 we	 peed	 in	 the	 snow
just	 outside	 the	 sliding	 glass
doors,	 too	 drunk	 to	 face	 his
mom	upstairs.	I	remember	her
telling	 me	 about	 having	 sex
with	 Jerry	 on	 the	 pool	 table.
Which	explained	why	the	felt
was	sticky.
“Hey,	 Kathy,	 it’s	 good	 to
see	you.	How’s	it	going?”
She	 threw	 her	 arms	 outand	 cast	 a	 glance	 around	 the
restaurant.
“Oh,	 you	 can	 probably
guess.	 But	 hey,	 that’s	 what
you	 get	 for	 sticking	 around
here,	 right?	 Bobby	 says	 hi.
Kidder.”
“Oh,	 right!	 God...”	 I’d
forgotten	 they	 got	 married.
“How	is	he?”
“Same	 old	 Bobby.	 You
should	drop	by	some	time.	If
you	have	time.	We’re	over	on
Fisher.”I	 could	 picture	 the	 clock
ticking	 loudly	 as	 I	 sat	 in	 the
living	 room	 of	 Bobby	 and
Kathy	Kidder,	trying	to	come
up	 with	 something	 to	 say.
Kathy	 would	 do	 all	 the
talking,	 she	 always	 had.	 She
was	the	kind	of	person	who’d
read	 street	 signs	 aloud	 rather
than	 suffer	 silence.	 If	 he	 was
still	 the	 same	 old	 Bobby,	 he
was	 quiet	 but	 affable,	 a	 guy
with	 few	 interests	 and	 slate
blue	 eyes	 that	 flicked	 intofocus	 only	 when	 talk	 turned
to	 hunting.	 Back	 in	 high
school,	 he	 saved	 the	 hooves
of	 all	 the	 deer	 he	 killed,
always	 had	 the	 latest	 pair	 in
his	 pocket,	 and	 would	 pull
them	 out	 and	 tap	 drumbeats
with	 them	 on	 whatever	 hard
surface	 was	 available.	 I
always	 felt	 like	 it	 was	 the
dead	 deer’s	 Morse	 code,	 a
delayed	
mayday	
from
tomorrow’s	venison.
“Anyway,	you	guys	doingthe	buffet?”
I	 asked	 for	 a	 beer,	 which
brought	forth	a	mighty	pause.
Kathy	 glanced	 back	 over	 her
shoulder	 at	 the	 clock	 on	 the
wall.	 “Mmmm,	 we’re	 not
supposed	 to	 serve	 till	 eight.
But	I’ll	see	if	I	can	sneak	you
one—old	times’	sake,	right?”
“Well,	I	don’t	want	to	get
you	 in	 trouble.”	 Just	 like
Wind	 Gap	 to	 have	 arbitrary
drinking	 rules.	 Five	 o’clock
would	 make	 sense,	 at	 least.Eight	 o’clock	 was	 just
someone’s	 way	 of	 making
you	feel	guilty.
“Lord,	 Camille,	 it’d	 be
the	 most	 interesting	 thing
that’s	happened	to	me	in	quite
a	while.”
While	 Kathy	 went	 to
purloin	 me	 a	 drink,	 Richard
and	 I	 filled	 plates	 with
chicken-fried	 steak,	 grits,
mashed	 potatoes,	 and,	 in
Richard’s	 case,	 a	 jiggly	 slab
of	 Jell-O	 that	 was	 meltinginto	 his	 food	 by	 the	 time	 we
returned	 to	 our	 table.	 Kathy
had	 left	 a	 bottle	 of	 beer
discreetly	on	my	seat	cushion.
“Always	 drink	 this
early?”
“I’m	just	having	a	beer.”
“I	 could	 smell	 liquor	 on
your	 breath	 when	 you	 came
in,	 underneath	 a	 layer	 of
Certs—wintergreen?”	
He
smiled	 at	 me,	 as	 if	 he	 were
simply	curious,	no	judgments.
I	 bet	 he	 glowed	 in	 theinterrogation	room.
“Certs,	yes;	liquor,	no.”
In	 truth,	 that’s	 why	 I’d
been	 late.	 Right	 before	 I
pulled	 into	 the	 parking	 lot,	 I
realized	 the	 quick	 nip	 I	 took
after	 leaving	 the	 Keenes
needed	 some	 quick	 covering
up,	 and	 drove	 another	 few
blocks	 to	 the	 convenience
store	 to	 buy	 some	 mints.
Wintergreen.
“Okay,	 Camille,”	 he	 said
gently.	“No	worries.	It’s	noneof	 my	 business.”	 He	 took	 a
bite	of	mashed	potatoes,	dyed
red	 from	 the	 Jell-O,	 and
stayed	silent.	Seemed	slightly
abashed.
“So,	what	do	you	want	to
know	 about	 Wind	 Gap?”	 I
felt	 I’d	 disappointed	 him
keenly,	 like	 I	 was	 a	 careless
parent	reneging	on	a	birthday
promise	 to	 take	 him	 to	 the
zoo.	I	was	willing	to	tell	him
the	 truth	 then,	 to	 answer
unfailingly	 the	 next	 questionhe	 asked	 in	 order	 to	 make	 it
up	 to	 him—and	 I	 suddenly
wondered	 if	 that	 was	 the
reason	 he’d	 challenged	 my
drinking	to	begin	with.	Smart
cop.
He	 stared	 me	 down.	 “I
want	 to	 know	 about	 its
violence.	 Every	 place	 has	 its
own	 particular	 strain.	 Is	 it	 in
the	 open,	 is	 it	 hidden?	 Is	 it
committed	 as	 a	 group—bar
fights,	 gang	 rapes—or	 is	 it
specific,	 personal?	 Whocommits	 it?	 Who’s	 the
target?”
“Well,	I	don’t	know	that	I
can	 just	 make	 a	 sweeping
statement	of	the	entire	history
of	violence	here.”
“Name	 a	 truly	 violent
incident	 you	 saw	 growing
up.”
My	mother	with	the	baby.
“I	 saw	 a	 woman	 hurt	 a
child.”
“Spanking?	Hitting?”
“She	bit	it.”“Okay.	Boy	or	girl?”
“Girl,	I	think.”
“The	child	was	hers?”
“No.”
“Okay,	okay,	this	is	good.
So	 a	 very	 personal	 act	 of
violence	 on	 a	 female	 child.
Who	 committed	 it,	 I’ll	 check
it	out.”
“I	 don’t	 know	 the
person’s	 name.	 It	 was
someone’s	 relative	 from	 out
of	town.”
“Well,	 who	 would	 knowher	 name?	 I	 mean,	 if	 she	 has
ties	 here,	 it’d	 be	 worth
looking	into.”
I	 could	 feel	 my	 limbs
disconnecting,	
floating
nearby	 like	 driftwood	 on	 an
oily	 lake.	 I	 pressed	 my
fingertips	 against	 my	 fork
tines.	 Just	 saying	 the	 story
aloud	 panicked	 me.	 I	 hadn’t
even	 thought	 Richard	 might
want	specifics.
“Hey,	 I	 thought	 this	 was
just	 supposed	 to	 be	 a	 profileof	violence,”	I	said,	my	voice
hollow	 behind	 the	 blood	 in
my	 ears.	 “I	 don’t	 have	 any
details.	 It	 was	 a	 woman	 I
didn’t	 recognize,	 and	 I	 don’t
know	 who	 she	 was	 with.	 I
just	 assumed	 she	 was	 from
out	of	town.”
“I	thought	reporters	didn’t
assume.”	 He	 was	 smiling
again.
“I	wasn’t	a	reporter	at	the
time,	I	was	only	a	girl....”
“Camille,	 I’m	 giving	 youa	 hard	 time,	 I’m	 sorry.”	 He
plucked	 the	 fork	 from	 my
fingers,	 placed	 it	 deliberately
on	 his	 side	 of	 the	 table,
picked	my	hand	up	and	kissed
it.	 I	 could	 see	 the	 word
lipstick	crawling	out	from	my
right	shirtsleeve.	“I’m	sorry,	I
didn’t	 mean	 to	 grill	 you.	 I
was	playing	bad	cop.”
“I	 find	 it	 difficult	 to	 see
you	as	bad	cop.”
He	 grinned.	 “True,	 it’s	 a
stretch.	 Curse	 these	 boyishgood	looks!”
We	 sipped	 our	 drinks	 for
a	 second.	 He	 twirled	 the	 salt
shaker	and	said,	“Can	I	ask	a
few	 more	 questions?”	 I
nodded.	 “What’s	 the	 next
incident	you	can	think	of?”
The	 overpowering	 smell
of	the	tuna	salad	on	my	plate
was	 making	 my	 stomach
twist.	 I	 looked	 for	 Kathy	 to
get	another	beer.
“Fifth	 grade.	 Two	 boys
cornered	 a	 girl	 at	 recess	 andhad	 her	 put	 a	 stick	 inside
herself.”
“Against	 her	 will?	 They
forced	her?”
“Mmmm...a	 little	 bit	 I
guess.	 They	 were	 bullies,
they	told	her	to,	and	she	did.”
“And	 you	 saw	 this	 or
heard	about	it?”
“They	told	a	few	of	us	to
watch.	 When	 the	 teacher
found	 out,	 we	 had	 to
apologize.”
“To	the	girl?”“No,	 the	 girl	 had	 to
apologize	 too,	 to	 the	 class.
‘Young	 ladies	 must	 be	 in
control	 of	 their	 bodies
because	boys	are	not.’”
“Jesus.	
You	
forget
sometimes	 how	 different
things	 were,	 and	 not	 that
many	 years	 ago.	 How	 just...
uninformed.”	 Richard	 jotted
in	 his	 notebook,	 slid	 some
Jell-O	down	his	throat.	“What
else	do	you	remember?”
“Once,	 an	 eighth-gradegirl	 got	 drunk	 at	 a	 high-
school	 party	 and	 four	 or	 five
guys	on	the	football	team	had
sex	 with	 her,	 kind	 of	 passed
her	around.	Does	that	count?”
“Camille.	 Of	 course	 it
counts.	 You	 know	 that,
right?”
“Well,	 I	 just	 didn’t	 know
if	 that	 counted	 as	 outright
violence	or...”
“Yeah,	 I’d	 count	 a	 bunch
of	 punks	 raping	 a	 thirteen-
year-old	 outright	 violence,yes	I	sure	would.”
“How	 is	 everything?”
Kathy	 was	 suddenly	 smiling
over	us.
“You	 think	 you	 could
sneak	me	one	more	beer?”
“Two.”	Richard	said.
“All	 right,	 this	 one	 I	 do
only	 as	 a	 favor	 to	 Richard,
since	 he’s	 the	 best	 tipper	 in
town.”
“Thanks,	Kathy.”	Richard
smiled.
I	 leaned	 across	 the	 table.“I’m	 not	 arguing	 that	 it’s
wrong,	 Richard;	 I’m	 just
trying	 to	 get	 your	 criteria	 for
violence.”
“Right,	 and	 I’m	 getting	 a
good	 picture	 of	 exactly	 the
kind	 of	 violence	 we’re
dealing	with	here,	just	by	the
fact	 that	 you’re	 asking	 me	 if
that	 counts.	 Were	 the	 police
notified?”
“Of	course	not.”
“I’m	surprised	she	wasn’t
made	 to	 apologize	 forallowing	 them	 to	 rape	 her	 in
the	 first	 place.	 Eighth	 grade.
That	 makes	 me	 sick.”	 He
tried	 to	 take	 my	 hand	 again,
but	 I	 tucked	 it	 away	 in	 my
lap.
“So	 it’s	 the	 age	 that
makes	it	rape.”
“It’d	be	rape	at	any	age.”
“If	I	got	a	little	too	drunk
tonight,	 and	 was	 out	 of	 my
head	 and	 had	 sex	 with	 four
guys,	that	would	be	rape?”
“Legally,	 I	 don’t	 know,it’d	depend	on	a	lot	of	things
—like	 your	 attorney.	 But
ethically,	hell	yes.”
“You’re	sexist.”
“What?”
“You’re	 sexist.	 I’m	 so
sick	 of	 liberal	 lefty	 men
practicing	
sexual
discrimination	 under	 the
guise	 of	 protecting	 women
against	
sexual
discrimination.”
“I	 can	 assure	 you	 I	 am
doing	nothing	of	the	sort.”“I	have	a	guy	in	my	office
—sensitive.	 When	 I	 got
passed	 over	 for	 a	 promotion,
he	 suggested	 I	 sue	 for
discrimination.	 I	 wasn’t
discriminated	against,	I	was	a
mediocre	 reporter.	 And
sometimes	 drunk	 women
aren’t	 raped;	 they	 just	 make
stupid	 choices—and	 to	 say
we	 deserve	 special	 treatment
when	 we’re	 drunk	 because
we’re	women,	to	say	we	need
to	 be	 looked	 after,	 I	 findoffensive.”
Kathy	came	back	with	our
beers	 and	 we	 sipped	 in
silence	 until	 they	 were
drained.
“Geez	 Preaker,	 okay,	 I
give.”
“Okay.”
“You	 do	 see	 a	 pattern,
though,	 right?	 In	 the	 attacks
on	 females.	 In	 the	 attitude
about	the	attacks.”
“Except	 neither	 the	 Nash
or	 Keene	 girl	 was	 sexuallymolested.	Right?”
“I	 think	 in	 our	 guy’s
mind,	 the	 teeth	 pulling	 is
equivalent	 to	 rape.	 That’s	 all
about	power—it’s	invasive,	it
requires	 a	 goodly	 amount	 of
force,	 and	 as	 each	 tooth
comes	out...release.”
“Is	this	on	record?”
“If	 I	 see	 this	 in	 your
paper,	 if	 I	 see	 even	 a	 hint	 of
this	 conversation	 under	 your
byline,	 you	 and	 I	 will	 never
speak	 again.	 And	 that	 wouldbe	 really	 bad,	 because	 I	 like
talking	 to	 you.	 Cheers.”
Richard	 clicked	 his	 empty
against	mine.	I	stayed	silent.
“In	 fact,	 let	 me	 take	 you
out,”	 he	 said.	 “Just	 for	 fun.
No	 shop	 talk.	 My	 brain
desperately	 needs	 a	 night	 off
from	 this	 stuff.	 We	 could	 do
something	
appropriately
small	town.”
I	raised	my	eyebrows.
“Pull	 taffy?	 Catch	 a
greased	 pig?”	 he	 beganticking	 activities	 on	 his
fingers.	 “Make	 our	 own	 ice
cream?	 Ride	 down	 Main
Street	 in	 one	 of	 those	 little
Shriners	 cars?	 Oh,	 is	 there	 a
quaint	 county	 fair	 anywhere
near	here—I	could	perform	a
feat	of	strength	for	you.”
“That	 attitude	 must	 really
endear	you	to	the	locals.”
“Kathy	likes	me.”
“Because	you	tip	her.”
	
We	 ended	 up	 at	 GarrettPark,	 jammed	 on	 swings	 that
were	 too	 small	 for	 us,
wobbling	 back	 and	 forth	 in
the	 hot	 evening	 dust.	 The
place	 Natalie	 Keene	 was	 last
seen	 alive,	 but	 neither	 of	 us
mentioned	 it.	 Across	 the
ballpark,	 an	 old	 stone
drinking	 fountain	 spurted
water	 endlessly,	 would	 never
go	off	until	Labor	Day.
“I	see	a	lot	of	high-school
kids	 partying	 here	 at
nighttime,”	 Richard	 said.“Vickery’s	 too	 busy	 these
days	to	chase	them	off.”
“It	 was	 like	 that	 even
when	 I	 was	 in	 high	 school.
Drinking’s	not	that	big	a	deal
down	
here.	
Except,
apparently	at	Gritty’s.”
“I’d	like	to	have	seen	you
at	sixteen.	Let	me	guess:	You
were	 like	 the	 wild	 preacher’s
daughter.	 Looks,	 money,	 and
a	 brain.	 That’s	 a	 recipe	 for
trouble	around	here	I’d	guess.
I	 can	 picture	 you	 right	 overthere,”	he	said,	pointing	to	the
cracked	
bleachers.
“Outdrinking	the	boys.”
The	 least	 of	 the	 outrages
I’d	 committed	 in	 this	 park.
Not	only	my	first	kiss,	but	my
first	blow	job,	at	age	thirteen.
A	senior	on	the	baseball	team
took	me	under	his	wing,	then
took	 me	 into	 the	 woods.	 He
wouldn’t	 kiss	 me	 until	 I
serviced	 him.	 Then	 he
wouldn’t	 kiss	 me	 because	 of
where	 my	 mouth	 had	 been.Young	 love.	 Not	 long	 after
was	 my	 wild	 night	 at	 the
football	 party,	 the	 story	 that
had	 gotten	 Richard	 so	 riled.
Eighth	 grade,	 four	 guys.	 Got
more	 action	 then	 than	 I’ve
had	in	the	past	ten	years.	I	felt
the	 word	 wicked	 blaze	 up	 by
my	pelvis.
“I	had	my	share	of	fun,”	I
said.	 “Looks	 and	 money	 get
you	 a	 long	 way	 in	 Wind
Gap.”
“And	brains?”“Brains	 you	 hide.	 I	 had	 a
lot	 of	 friends,	 but	 no	 one	 I
was	close	to,	you	know?”
“I	can	imagine.	Were	you
close	to	your	mom?”
“Not	 particularly.”	 I’d
had	one	too	many	drinks;	my
face	felt	closed	and	hot.
“Why?”	 Richard	 twisted
his	swing	to	face	me.
“I	just	think	some	women
aren’t	 made	 to	 be	 mothers.
And	 some	 women	 aren’t
made	to	be	daughters.”“Did	 she	 ever	 hurt	 you?”
The	 question	 unnerved	 me,
particularly	 after	 our	 dinner
conversation.	Hadn’t	she	hurt
me?	 I	 felt	 sure	 someday	 I’d
dream	 a	 memory	 of	 her,
scratching	 or	 biting	 or
pinching.	 I	 felt	 like	 that	 had
happened.	 I	 pictured	 myself
pulling	off	my	blouse	to	show
him	my	scars,	screaming,	yes,
look!	Indulgent.
“That’s	
a	
bizarre
question,	Richard.”“I’m	 sorry,	 you	 just
sounded	 so...sad.	 Mad.
Something.”
“That’s	 the	 mark	 of
someone	 who	 has	 a	 healthy
relationship	with	his	parents.”
“Guilty.”	 He	 laughed.
“What	 about	 I	 change	 the
subject?”
“Yes.”
“Okay,	 let’s	 see...light
conversation.	
Swing-set
conversation.”	
Richard
scrunched	 his	 face	 up	 tomime	 thinking.	 “Okay,	 so
what’s	 your	 favorite	 color,
your	 favorite	 ice	 cream
flavor,	 and	 your	 favorite
season?
“Blue,	
coffee,	
and
winter.”
“Winter.	 No	 one	 likes
winter.”
“It	 gets	 dark	 early,	 I	 like
that.”
“Why?”
Because	 that	 means	 the
day	 has	 ended.	 I	 likechecking	 days	 off	 a	 calendar
—151	 days	 crossed	 and
nothing	 truly	 horrible	 has
happened.	 152	 and	 the	 world
isn’t	 ruined.	 153	 and	 I
haven’t	 destroyed	 anyone.
154	 and	 no	 one	 really	 hates
me.	 Sometimes	 I	 think	 I
won’t	 ever	 feel	 safe	 until	 I
can	count	my	last	days	on	one
hand.	Three	more	days	to	get
through	 until	 I	 don’t	 have	 to
worry	about	life	anymore.
“I	 just	 like	 the	 night.”	 Iwas	 about	 to	 say	 more,	 not
much	more,	but	more,	when	a
broken-down	 yellow	 IROC
rumbled	 to	 a	 stop	 across	 the
street	 and	 Amma	 and	 her
blondes	 piled	 out	 the	 back.
Amma	 leaned	 into	 the
driver’s	 window,	 cleavage
teasing	 the	 boy,	 who	 had	 the
long	 greasy	 dirt-blond	 hair
you’d	expect	of	someone	who
still	 drove	 a	 yellow	 IROC.
The	 three	 girls	 stood	 behind
her,	hips	jutted	out,	the	tallestturning	 her	 ass	 to	 them	 and
bending	 over,	 lean	 and	 long
to	 pretend	 to	 tie	 her	 shoe.
Nice	moves.
The	 girls	 glided	 toward
us,	 Amma	 waving	 her	 hands
extravagantly	in	protest	of	the
black	 exhaust	 cloud.	 They
were	hot	little	things,	I	had	to
admit.	 Long	 blonde	 hair,
heart-shaped	 faces,	 and
skinny	 legs.	 Miniskirts	 with
tiny	 Ts	 exposing	 flat	 baby
tummies.	 And	 except	 for	 thegirl	 Jodes,	 whose	 bosom	 was
too	 high	 and	 stiff	 to	 be
anything	but	padding,	the	rest
had	 breasts,	 full	 and	 wobbly
and	 way	 overripe.	 All	 those
milk-fed,	 hog-fed,	 beef-fed
early	 years.	 All	 those	 extra
hormones	 we	 put	 in	 our
livestock.	 We’ll	 be	 seeing
toddlers	with	tits	before	long.
“Hey,	 Dick,”	 Amma
called.	 She	 was	 sucking	 on	 a
red	oversized	Blow	Pop.
“Hi,	ladies.”“Hi,	 Camille,	 make	 me	 a
star	 yet?”	 Amma	 asked,
rolling	her	tongue	around	the
sucker.	 The	 Alps-inspired
braids	were	gone,	as	were	the
clothes	 she’d	 worn	 to	 the
plant,	which	had	to	reek	with
odors	of	all	kinds	and	species.
Now	 she	 wore	 a	 tank	 and	 a
skirt	that	passed	her	crotch	by
an	inch.
“Not	 yet.”	 She	 had	 peach
skin,	 so	 free	 of	 blotches	 or
wrinkles,	 her	 face	 so	 perfectand	 character-free	 she	 could
have	 just	 popped	 out	 of	 the
womb.	 They	 all	 seemed
unfinished.	 I	 wanted	 them	 to
go	away.
“Dick,	 when	 are	 you
going	 to	 take	 us	 for	 a	 ride?”
Amma	asked,	plopping	down
in	 the	 dirt	 in	 front	 of	 us,	 her
legs	 pulled	 up	 to	 reveal	 a
glimpse	of	her	panties.
“To	 do	 that,	 I’d	 have	 to
arrest	 you.	 I	 might	 have	 to
arrest	 those	 boys	 you	 keephanging	 around	 with.	 High-
school	 boys	 are	 too	 old	 for
you.”
“They’re	 not	 in	 high
school,”	said	the	tall	girl.
“Yeah,”	 Amma	 giggled.
“They	dropped	out.”
“Amma,	 how	 old	 are
you?”	Richard	asked.
“Just	turned	thirteen.”
“Why	do	you	always	care
so	 much	 about	 Amma?”
interrupted	the	brassy	blonde.
“We’re	 here,	 too,	 you	 know.You	 probably	 don’t	 even
know	our	names.”
“Camille,	 have	 you	 met
Kylie,	 Kelsey,	 and	 Kelsey?”
Richard	 said,	 pointing	 to	 the
tall	 girl,	 the	 brassy	 girl,	 and
the	girl	my	sister	called...
“That’s	 Jodes,”	 Amma
said.	“There	are	two	Kelseys,
so	she	goes	by	her	last	name.
To	 avoid	 confusion.	 Right,
Jodes?”
“They	can	call	me	Kelsey
if	 they	 want,”	 said	 the	 girl,whose	 low	 spot	 in	 the
pecking	 order	 was	 likely
punishment	 for	 being	 the
least	 of	 the	 beauties.	 Weak
chin.
“And	 Amma	 is	 your	 half
sister,	
right?”	
Richard
continued.	 “I’m	 not	 as	 out	 of
the	loop	as	all	that.”
“No,	 it	 looks	 like	 you’re
right	 in	 the	 loop,”	 Amma
said.	 She	 made	 the	 words
sound	 sexual,	 even	 though	 I
could	 think	 of	 no	 doubleentendre.	 “So,	 are	 you	 guys
dating	 or	 what?	 I	 heard	 little
Camille	 here	 is	 a	 real	 hot
ticket.	At	least	she	was.”
Richard	let	out	a	burp	of	a
laugh,	 a	 shocked	 croak.
Unworthy	flared	up	my	leg.
“It’s	 true,	 Richard.	 I	 was
something	back	in	the	day.”
“Something,”	
Amma
mocked.	 The	 two	 girls
laughed.	 Jodes	 drew	 frantic
lines	 in	 the	 dirt	 with	 a	 stick.
“You	 should	 hear	 the	 stories,Dick.	 They’d	 get	 you	 pretty
hot.	 Or	 maybe	 you	 already
have.”
“Ladies,	 we’ve	 got	 to	 be
going,	 but	 as	 always,	 it	 was
definitely	
something,”
Richard	 said,	 and	 took	 my
hand	 to	 help	 me	 out	 of	 the
swing.	Held	on	to	it,	squeezed
it	twice	as	we	walked	toward
the	car.
“Isn’t	 he	 a	 gentleman,”
Amma	 called,	 and	 the	 four
got	 to	 their	 feet	 and	 beganfollowing	 us.	 “Can’t	 solve
crime,	 but	 he	 can	 take	 the
time	 to	 help	 Camille	 into	 his
crappy-ass	 car.”	 They	 were
right	on	us,	Amma	and	Kylie
stepping	 on	 our	 heels,
literally.	 I	 could	 feel	 sickly
glowing	 where	 Amma’s
sandal	 had	 scuffed	 my
Achilles	 tendon.	 Then	 she
took	 her	 wet	 sucker	 and
twirled	it	in	my	hair.
“Stop	 it,”	 I	 muttered.	 I
twirled	 around	 and	 grabbedher	wrist	so	hard	I	could	feel
her	 pulse.	 Slower	 than	 mine.
She	 didn’t	 squirm,	 in	 fact,
just	 pushed	 closer	 into	 me.	 I
could	 feel	 her	 strawberry
breath	 fill	 the	 hollow	 of	 my
neck.
“Come	
on,	
do
something.”	 Amma	 smiled.
“You	could	kill	me	right	now
and	 Dick	 still	 wouldn’t	 be
able	to	figure	it	out.”	I	let	go,
pushed	 her	 away	 from	 me,
and	Richard	and	I	shuffled	tothe	 car	 faster	 than	 I	 would
have	liked.	
Chapter	Nine
I	 fell	 asleep,	 accidentally
and	 hard,	 at	 nine	 o’clock,
woke	to	an	angry	sun	at	seven
the	next	morning.	A	dried-out
tree	 rustled	 its	 branches
against	my	window	screen	as
if	 it	 wanted	 to	 climb	 in	 next
to	me	for	comfort.
I	 donned	 my	 uniform—
the	 long	 sleeves,	 the	 long
skirt—and	
wandereddownstairs.	
Gayla	
was
glowing	 in	 the	 backyard,	 her
white	 nurse’s	 dress	 brilliant
against	the	greenery.	She	held
a	 silver	 tray	 on	 which	 my
mother	was	placing	imperfect
roses.	 My	 mother	 wore	 a
butter-colored	 sundress	 that
matched	 her	 hair.	 She	 was
stalking	 through	 the	 clumps
of	 pink	 and	 yellow	 blooms
with	 a	 pair	 of	 pliers.	 She
examined	
each	
flower
hungrily,	 plucking	 off	 petals,pushing	and	prying.
“You	 need	 to	 water	 these
more,	 Gayla.	 Look	 what
you’ve	done	to	them.”
She	separated	a	light	pink
rose	from	a	bush,	pulled	it	to
the	 ground,	 secured	 it	 with	 a
dainty	foot,	and	clipped	it	off
at	 its	 root.	 Gayla	 must	 have
had	 two	 dozen	 roses	 on	 her
tray.	 I	 could	 see	 little	 wrong
with	them.
“Camille,	 you	 and	 I	 are
going	shopping	in	Woodberrytoday,”	 my	 mother	 called
without	 looking	 up.	 “Shall
we?”	My	mother	said	nothing
about	 the	 square-off	 at	 the
Nashes	 the	 day	 before.	 That
would	be	too	direct.
“I	 have	 a	 few	 things	 to
do,”	 I	 said.	 “By	 the	 way,	 I
didn’t	know	you	were	friends
with	 the	 Nashes.	 With	 Ann.”
I	 had	 a	 catch	 of	 guilt	 for	 my
taunting	 her	 about	 the	 girl	 at
breakfast	 the	 other	 morning.
It	 wasn’t	 that	 I	 truly	 felt	 badthat	 I’d	 upset	 my	 mother—it
was	 more	 that	 I	 hated	 any
debits	in	her	column.
“Mmmm-hmm.	 Alan	 and
I	 are	 having	 a	 party	 next
Saturday.	It	was	planned	long
before	 we	 knew	 you	 were
coming.	 Although	 I	 suppose
we	 didn’t	 really	 know	 you
were	 coming	 until	 you	 were
here.”
Another	rose	snapped	off.
“I	 thought	 you	 barely
knew	 the	 girls.	 I	 didn’trealize...”
“Fine.	 It	 will	 be	 a	 nice
summer	 party,	 a	 lot	 of	 really
fine	people,	and	you’ll	need	a
dress.	 I’m	 sure	 you	 didn’t
bring	a	dress?”
“No.”
“Good	 then,	 it	 will	 be	 a
nice	 chance	 for	 us	 to	 catch
up.	 You’ve	 been	 here	 over	 a
week,	 I	 think	 it’s	 time.”	 She
placed	 a	 final	 stem	 on	 the
tray.	 “Okay,	 Gayla,	 you	 can
throw	these	away.	We’ll	picksome	 decent	 ones	 for	 the
house	later.”
“I’ll	 take	 those	 for	 my
room,	 Momma.	 They	 look
fine	to	me.”
“They’re	not.”
“I	don’t	mind.”
“Camille,	 I	 was	 just
looking	 at	 them,	 and	 they’re
not	 good	 blooms.”	 She
dropped	 the	 pliers	 to	 the
ground,	 began	 tugging	 at	 a
stem.
“But	 they’re	 fine	 for	 me.For	my	room.”
“Oh,	 now	 look	 what
you’ve	 done.	 I’m	 bleeding.”
My	 mother	 held	 up	 thorn-
pricked	 hands,	 and	 trails	 of
deep	 red	 began	 to	 roll	 down
her	
wrists.	
End	
of
conversation.	 She	 walked
toward	 the	 house,	 Gayla
following	 her,	 me	 following
Gayla.	 The	 back-door	 knob
was	sticky	with	blood.
Alan	 bandaged	 both	 my
mother’s	hands	extravagantly,and	 when	 we	 nearly	 tumbled
over	 Amma,	 working	 again
on	 her	 dollhouse	 on	 the
porch,	
Adora	
plucked
teasingly	at	her	braid	and	told
her	 to	 come	 with	 us.	 She
followed	 obligingly,	 and	 I
kept	 waiting	 for	 those	 knicks
at	my	heels.	Not	with	Mother
around.
Adora	wanted	me	to	drive
her	 baby	 blue	 convertible	 to
Woodberry,	 which	 boasted
two	 high-end	 boutiques,	 butshe	didn’t	want	the	top	down.
“We	 get	 cold,”	 she	 said	 with
a	 conspiratorial	 smile	 at
Amma.	 The	 girl	 sat	 silently
behind	 my	 mother,	 twisted
her	 mouth	 into	 a	 smart-ass
smile	 when	 I	 caught	 her
staring	at	me	in	the	rearview.
Every	 few	 minutes,	 she’d
brush	 her	 fingertips	 against
my	 mother’s	 hair,	 lightly	 so
she	wouldn’t	notice.
As	I	parked	the	Mercedes
outside	 her	 favorite	 shop,Adora	requested	weakly	that	I
open	 the	 car	 door	 for	 her.	 It
was	 the	 first	 thing	 she’d	 said
to	me	in	twenty	minutes.	Nice
to	 catch	 up.	 I	 opened	 the
boutique’s	 door	 for	 her	 too,
and	 the	 feminine	 bell
matched	 the	 saleswoman’s
delighted	greeting.
“Adora!”	 And	 then	 a
frown.	
“My	
goodness,
darling,	 what’s	 happened	 to
your	hands?”
“Just	 an	 accident,	 really.Doing	some	work	around	the
house.	I’ll	see	my	doctor	this
afternoon.”	 Of	 course	 she
would.	 She’d	 go	 for	 a	 paper
cut.
“What	happened?”
“Oh,	 I	 really	 don’t	 want
to	 talk	 about	 it.	 I	 do	 want	 to
introduce	you	to	my	daughter,
Camille.	She’s	visiting.”
The	 saleswoman	 looked
at	 Amma,	 then	 gave	 me	 a
wavering	smile.
“Camille?”	 A	 quickrecovery:	 “I	 think	 I’d
forgotten	 that	 you	 have	 a
third	 daughter.”	 She	 lowered
her	 voice	 on	 the	 word
“daughter,”	 as	 if	 it	 were	 an
oath.	“She	must	take	after	her
father,”	 the	 woman	 said,
peering	 into	 my	 face	 as	 if	 I
were	 a	 horse	 she	 might	 buy.
“Amma	 looks	 so	 much	 like
you,	 and	 Marian	 too,	 in	 your
pictures.	This	one,	though...”
“She	 doesn’t	 take	 after
me	 much,”	 my	 mother	 said.“She	 has	 her	 father’s
coloring,	and	his	cheekbones.
And	his	temperament.”
It	 was	 the	 most	 I’d	 ever
heard	 my	 mother	 say	 about
my	 father.	 I	 wondered	 how
many	 other	 salesladies	 had
received	 such	 casual	 tidbits
about	 him.	 I	 had	 a	 quick
vision	 of	 chatting	 up	 all	 the
store	 clerks	 in	 southern
Missouri,	 putting	 together	 a
blurry	profile	of	the	man.
My	mother	petted	my	hairwith	 gauzy	 hands.	 “We	 need
to	 get	 my	 sweetheart	 a	 new
dress.	 Something	 colorful.
She’s	 prone	 to	 blacks	 and
grays.	Size	four.”
The	 woman,	 so	 thin	 her
hip	 bones	 poked	 from	 her
skirt	 like	 antlers,	 started
weaving	 in	 and	 out	 of	 the
circular	 racks,	 creating	 a
bouquet	of	splashy	green	and
blue	and	pink	dresses.
“This	
would	
look
beautiful	 on	 you,”	 Ammasaid,	 holding	 a	 glittery	 gold
top	to	my	mother.
“Stop	 it,	 Amma,”	 my
mother	said.	“That’s	tacky.”
“Do	 I	 really	 remind	 you
of	my	father?”	I	couldn’t	help
asking	Adora.	I	could	feel	my
cheeks	 get	 hot	 at	 my
presumptuousness.
“I	knew	you	wouldn’t	just
let	 that	 go,”	 she	 said,
touching	 up	 her	 lipstick	 in	 a
store	 mirror.	 The	 gauze	 on
her	
hands	
remainedimpossibly	unsmeared.
“I	 was	 just	 curious;	 I’d
never	 heard	 you	 say	 my
personality	 reminded	 you
of...”
“Your	
personality
reminds	 me	 of	 someone	 very
unlike	me.	And	you	certainly
don’t	 take	 after	 Alan,	 so	 I
assume	it	must	be	your	father.
Now,	no	more.”
“But	 Momma,	 I	 just
wanted	to	know...”
“Camille,	 you’re	 makingme	bleed	more.”	She	held	up
her	 bandaged	 hands,	 now
pocked	 with	 red.	 I	 wanted	 to
scratch	her.
The	 saleslady	 bumped	 up
on	 us	 with	 a	 swatch	 of
dresses.	 “This	 is	 the	 one
you’re	 absolutely	 going	 to
have	 to	 have,”	 she	 said,
holding	 up	 a	 turquoise
sundress.	Strapless.
“And	what	about	sweetie-
pie	 here,”	 the	 woman	 said,
nodding	 at	 Amma.	 “She	 canprobably	 already	 fit	 into	 our
petites.”
“Amma’s	 only	 thirteen.
She’s	 not	 ready	 for	 these
types	 of	 clothes,”	 my	 mother
said.
“Only	 thirteen,	 good	 god.
I	 keep	 forgetting,	 she	 looks
like	such	a	big	girl.	You	must
be	worried	sick	with	all	that’s
going	on	in	Wind	Gap	now.”
My	 mother	 put	 an	 arm
around	Amma,	kissed	the	top
of	 her	 head.	 “Some	 days	 Ithink	 I	 won’t	 be	 able	 to	 take
the	 worry.	 I	 want	 to	 lock	 her
away	somewhere.”
“Like	 Bluebeard’s	 dead
wives,”	Amma	mumbled.
“Like	 Rapunzel,”	 my
mother	 said.	 “Well,	 go	 on,
Camille—show	 your	 sister
how	pretty	you	can	be.”
She	 trailed	 me	 into	 the
dressing	 area,	 silent	 and
righteous.	 In	 the	 little
mirrored	 room,	 with	 my
mother	 perched	 on	 a	 chairoutside,	 I	 surveyed	 my
options.	 Strapless,	 spaghetti
straps,	 cap	 sleeves.	 My
mother	 was	 punishing	 me.	 I
found	a	pink	dress	with	three-
quarter	 sleeves	 and,	 quickly
doffing	 my	 pants	 and	 shirt,
pulled	it	on.	The	neckline	was
lower	 than	 I’d	 thought:	 The
words	 on	 my	 chest	 looked
swollen	 in	 the	 fluorescent
light,	 like	 worms	 tunneled
beneath	my	skin.	Whine,	milk,
hurt,	bleed.“Camille,	let	me	see.”
“Uh,	this	won’t	work.”
“Let	 me	 see.”	 Belittle
burned	on	my	right	hip.
“Let	 me	 try	 another.”	 I
rifled	 through	 the	 other
dresses.	All	just	as	revealing.
I	caught	sight	of	myself	again
in	 the	 mirror.	 I	 was
horrifying.
“Camille,	open	the	door.”
“What’s	 wrong	 with
Camille?”	Amma	chimed.
“This	 won’t	 work.”	 Theside	 zipper	 was	 sticking.	 My
bared	 arms	 flashed	 scars	 in
deep	 pink	 and	 purple.	 Even
without	 looking	 directly	 in
the	 mirror	 I	 could	 see	 them
reflected	at	me—a	big	blur	of
scorched	skin.
“Camille,”	 my	 mother
spat.
“Why	 won’t	 she	 just
show	us?”
“Camille.”
“Momma,	 you	 saw	 the
dresses,	 you	 know	 why	 theywon’t	work,”	I	urged.
“Just	let	me	see.”
“I’ll	try	one	on,	Momma,”
Amma	wheedled.
“Camille...”
“Fine.”	I	banged	open	the
door.	 My	 mother,	 her	 face
level	 with	 my	 neckline,
winced.
“Oh,	 dear	 God.”	 I	 could
feel	 her	 breath	 on	 me.	 She
held	 up	 a	 bandaged	 hand,	 as
if	 about	 to	 touch	 my	 chest,
then	 let	 it	 drop.	 Behind	 herAmma	 whined	 like	 a	 puppy.
“Look	 what	 you’ve	 done	 to
yourself,”	 Adora	 said.	 “Look
at	it.”
“I	do.”
“I	hope	you	just	loved	it.	I
hope	you	can	stand	yourself.”
She	 shut	 the	 door	 and	 I
ripped	at	the	dress,	the	zipper
still	jammed	until	my	furious
tugs	 yanked	 the	 teeth	 apart
enough	 to	 get	 it	 to	 my	 hips,
where	 I	 wriggled	 out,	 the
zipper	 leaving	 a	 trail	 of	 pinkscratches	 on	 my	 skin.	 I
bunched	 the	 cotton	 of	 the
dress	 over	 my	 mouth	 and
screamed.
I	 could	 hear	 my	 mother’s
measured	 voice	 in	 the	 other
room.	 When	 I	 came	 out,	 the
saleswoman	 was	 wrapping	 a
long-sleeved,	 high-collared
lace	 blouse	 and	 a	 coral	 skirt
that	 would	 come	 to	 my
ankles.	 Amma	 stared	 at	 me,
her	 eyes	 pink	 and	 darting,
before	leaving	to	stand	by	thecar	outside.
Back	at	the	house	I	trailed
Adora	 into	 the	 entryway,
where	Alan	stood	in	a	falsely
casual	 pose,	 hands	 stuffed
into	his	linen	trouser	pockets.
She	fluttered	past	him	toward
the	stairs.
“How	was	your	day	out?”
he	called	after	her.
“Horrible,”	 my	 mother
whimpered.	 Upstairs	 I	 heard
her	door	close.	Alan	frowned
at	me	and	went	to	tend	to	mymother.	 Amma	 had	 already
disappeared.
I	walked	into	the	kitchen,
to	 the	 cutlery	 drawer.	 I
wanted	 to	 just	 look	 at	 the
knives	I	once	used	on	myself.
I	 wasn’t	 going	 to	 cut,	 just
allow	 myself	 that	 sharp
pressure.	 I	 could	 already	 feel
the	knifepoint	gently	pressing
against	the	plump	pads	of	my
fingertips,	 that	 delicate
tension	right	before	the	cut.
The	 drawer	 pulled	 outonly	 an	 inch	 and	 then
jammed.	 My	 mother	 had
padlocked	 it.	 I	 pulled	 again
and	 again.	 I	 could	 hear	 the
silvery	 clink	 of	 all	 those
blades	 sliding	 onto	 each
other.	 Like	 petulant	 metal
fish.	 My	 skin	 was	 hot.	 I	 was
about	 to	 go	 call	 Curry	 when
the	 doorbell	 insinuated	 itself
with	its	polite	tones.
Peering	 around	 the
corner,	 I	 could	 see	 Meredith
Wheeler	 and	 John	 Keenestanding	outside.
I	felt	like	I’d	been	caught
masturbating.	 Chewing	 the
inside	of	my	mouth,	I	opened
the	 door.	 Meredith	 rolled	 in,
assaying	 the	 rooms,	 letting
out	 minty	 exclamations	 of
how	beautiful	everything	was
and	 sending	 off	 waves	 of	 a
dark	perfume	more	suited	to	a
society	matron	than	a	teenage
girl	 in	 a	 green-and-white
cheerleading	 outfit.	 She
caught	me	looking.“I	 know,	 I	 know.	 School
days	are	over.	This	is	my	last
time	 to	 wear	 this	 actually.
We’re	having	a	cheer	session
with	next	year’s	girls.	It’s	sort
of	a	torch-passing	thing.	You
were	a	cheerleader,	right?”
“I	was,	if	you	can	believe
that.”	 I	 hadn’t	 been
particularly	 good,	 but	 I
looked	nice	in	the	skirt.	Back
in	the	days	when	I	limited	my
cutting	to	my	torso.
“I	 can	 believe	 it.	 Youwere	 the	 prettiest	 girl	 in	 the
entire	town.	My	cousin	was	a
freshman	 when	 you	 were	 a
senior.	Dan	Wheeler?	He	was
always	 talking	 about	 you.
Pretty	 and	 smart,	 pretty	 and
smart.	And	nice.	He’d	kill	me
if	 he	 knew	 I	 was	 telling	 you
this.	 He	 lives	 in	 Springfield
now.	But	he’s	not	married.”
Her	 wheedling	 tone
reminded	 me	 of	 just	 the	 kind
of	 girls	 I	 was	 never
comfortable	 with,	 the	 typeswho	 peddled	 a	 sort	 of	 plastic
chumminess,	 who	 told	 me
things	 about	 themselves	 only
friends	 should	 know,	 who
described	 themselves	 as
“people	persons.”
“This	 is	 John,”	 she	 said,
as	 if	 surprised	 to	 see	 him
beside	her.
My	 first	 time	 seeing	 him
up	 close.	 He	 was	 truly
beautiful,	
almost
androgynous,	 tall	 and	 slim
with	 obscenely	 full	 lips	 andice-colored	eyes.	He	tucked	a
shock	of	black	hair	behind	his
ear	and	smiled	at	his	hand	as
he	 held	 it	 out	 to	 me,	 as	 if	 it
were	
a	
beloved	
pet
performing	a	new	trick.
“So,	 where	 do	 you	 guys
want	 to	 talk?”	 Meredith
asked.	I	debated	for	a	second
about	 ridding	 myself	 of	 the
girl,	 worried	 she	 might	 not
know	 when,	 or	 how,	 to	 shut
up.	But	he	seemed	in	need	of
company,	and	I	didn’t	want	toscare	him	off.
“You	 guys	 grab	 a	 seat	 in
the	 living	 room,”	 I	 said.	 “I’ll
get	us	some	sweet	tea.”
I	 first	 bounded	 up	 the
stairs,	 slammed	 a	 new
cassette	
into	
my
minirecorder,	 and	 listened	 at
my	 mother’s	 door.	 Silence
except	 for	 the	 whir	 of	 a	 fan.
Was	 she	 sleeping?	 If	 so,	 was
Alan	curled	up	next	to	her	or
perched	 on	 her	 vanity	 chair,
just	 watching?	 Even	 after	 allthis	 time,	 I	 hadn’t	 even	 a
guess	as	to	the	private	life	of
Adora	 and	 her	 husband.
Walking	 past	 Amma’s	 room,
I	saw	her	sitting	very	properly
on	 the	 edge	 of	 a	 rocking
chair,	 reading	 a	 book	 called
Greek	 Goddesses.	 Since	 I’d
been	 here,	 she’d	 played	 at
being	 Joan	 of	 Arc	 and
Bluebeard’s	
wife	
and
Princess	 Diana—all	 martyrs,
I	 realized.	 She’d	 find	 even
unhealthier	 role	 modelsamong	 the	 goddesses.	 I	 left
her	to	it.
In	 the	 kitchen	 I	 poured
out	the	drinks.	Then,	counting
out	 a	 full	 ten	 seconds,	 I
pressed	 the	 tines	 of	 a	 fork
into	the	palm	of	my	hand.	My
skin	began	to	quiet	down.
I	 entered	 the	 living	 room
to	see	Meredith	with	her	legs
dangled	 over	 John’s	 lap,
kissing	 his	 neck.	 When	 I
clanked	 the	 tea	 tray	 down	 on
a	 table,	 she	 didn’t	 stop.	 Johnlooked	 at	 me	 and	 peeled
himself	slowly	away.
“You’re	 no	 fun	 today,”
she	pouted.
“So,	John,	I’m	really	glad
you	 decided	 to	 talk	 to	 me,”	 I
began.	 “I	 know	 your	 mom
has	been	reluctant.”
“Yes.	She	doesn’t	want	to
talk	 to	 much	 of	 anyone,	 but
especially	 not...press.	 She’s
very	private.”
“But	 you’re	 okay	 with
it?”	 I	 prompted.	 “You’reeighteen,	I	assume?”
“Just	 turned.”	 He	 sipped
his	tea	formally,	as	if	he	was
measuring	 tablespoons	 in	 his
mouth.
“Because	 what	 I	 really
want	is	to	be	able	to	describe
your	 sister	 to	 our	 readers,”	 I
said.	 “Ann	 Nash’s	 father	 is
speaking	 about	 her,	 and	 I
don’t	want	Natalie	to	get	lost
in	 this	 story.	 Does	 your
mother	know	you’re	speaking
to	me?”“No,	but	it’s	okay.	I	think
we’ll	 have	 to	 agree	 to
disagree	 about	 this.”	 His
laugh	came	in	a	quick	stutter.
“His	 mom	 is	 kind	 of	 a
freak	 about	 the	 media,”
Meredith	 said,	 drinking	 from
John’s	 glass.	 “She’s	 an
extremely	 private	 person.	 I
mean,	I	hardly	think	she	even
knows	 who	 I	 am,	 and	 we’ve
been	together	for	over	a	year,
right?”	 He	 nodded.	 She
frowned,	 disappointed,	 Iassumed,	that	he	didn’t	add	to
the	 story	 of	 their	 romance.
She	 removed	 her	 legs	 from
his	 lap,	 crossed	 them,	 and
began	 picking	 at	 the	 edge	 of
the	couch.
“And	I	hear	you’re	living
over	 with	 the	 Wheelers
now?”
“We	 have	 a	 place	 out
back,	 a	 carriage	 house	 from
the	 old	 days,”	 Meredith	 said.
“My	 little	 sister’s	 pissed;	 it
used	to	be	the	hangout	for	herand	 her	 nasty	 friends.	 Except
for	 your	 sister.	 Your	 sister’s
cool.	 You	 know	 my	 sister,
right?	Kelsey?”
Of	 course,	 this	 piece	 of
work	would	have	connections
to	Amma.
“Kelsey	 tall	 or	 Kelsey
small?”	I	asked.
“Totally.	 This	 town	 has
way	 too	 many	 Kelseys.
Mine’s	the	tall	one.”
“I’ve	met	her.	They	seem
close.”“They’d	 better	 be,”
Meredith	 said	 tightly.	 “Little
Amma	runs	that	school.	Be	a
fool	that	got	on	her	bad	side.”
Enough	 about	 Amma,	 I
thought,	 but	 images	 of	 her
teasing	 lesser	 girls	 by	 those
lockers	bumped	around	in	my
head.	 Junior	 high	 is	 an	 ugly
time.
“So,	 John,	 are	 you
adjusting	 all	 right	 over
there?”
“He’s	 fine,”	 Meredithsnipped.	 “We	 put	 together	 a
little	 care	 basket	 of	 guy	 stuff
for	 him—my	 mom	 even	 got
him	a	CD	player.”
“Oh,	 really?”	 I	 looked
pointedly	 at	 John.	 Time	 to
speak	 up,	 buddy.	 Don’t	 be
pussy	whipped	on	my	time.
“I	 just	 need	 to	 be	 away
from	 home	 right	 now,”	 he
said.	 “We’re	 all	 a	 little	 on
edge,	 you	 know,	 and
Natalie’s	stuff	is	everywhere,
and	 my	 mom	 won’t	 letanyone	 touch	 it.	 Her	 shoes
are	 in	 the	 hallway	 and	 her
swimming	 suit	 is	 hanging	 in
the	 bathroom	 we	 share	 so	 I
have	to	see	it	every	morning	I
shower.	I	can’t	deal.”
“I	can	imagine.”	I	could:	I
remember	 Marian’s	 tiny	 pink
coat	hanging	in	the	hall	closet
till	 I	 left	 for	 college.	 Might
still	be	there.
I	 turned	 on	 the	 tape
recorder,	pushed	it	across	the
table	toward	the	boy.“Tell	me	what	your	sister
was	like,	John.”
“Uh,	 she	 was	 a	 nice	 kid.
She	was	extremely	smart.	Just
unbelievable.”
“Smart	 how?	 Like	 good
in	school,	or	just	bright?”
“Well,	 she	 didn’t	 do	 that
well	 in	 school.	 She	 had	 a	 bit
of	 a	 discipline	 problem,”	 he
said.	 “But	 I	 think	 it	 was	 just
because	 she	 got	 bored.	 She
should	 have	 skipped	 a	 grade
or	two,	I	think.”“His	 mom	 thought	 it
would	 stigmatize	 her,”
Meredith	 interjected.	 “She
was	 always	 worried	 about
Natalie	sticking	out.”
I	 raised	 my	 eyebrows	 at
him.
“That’s	 true.	 My	 mom
really	wanted	Natalie	to	fit	in.
She	 was	 this	 sort	 of	 goofy
kid,	 kind	 of	 a	 tomboy,	 and
just	 kind	 of	 a	 weirdo.”	 He
laughed,	staring	at	his	feet.
“Are	 you	 thinking	 of	 aparticular	 story?”	 I	 asked.
Anecdotes	are	Curry’s	coin	of
the	 realm.	 Plus,	 I	 was
interested.
“Oh,	 like	 once,	 she
invented	 this	 whole	 other
language,	 you	 know?	 And	 a
regular	 kid,	 I	 mean	 it’d	 be
gibberish.	But	Natalie	had	the
whole	 alphabet	 figured	 out—
looked	like	Russian.	And	she
actually	 taught	 it	 to	 me.	 Or
tried.	 She	 got	 frustrated	 with
me	 pretty	 quickly.”	 Helaughed	 again,	 that	 same
croak,	 like	 it	 was	 coming	 up
from	underground.
“Did	she	like	school?”
“Well	 it’s	 hard	 to	 be	 the
new	kid,	and	the	girls	here...
well	 I	 guess	 the	 girls
anywhere	 can	 be	 a	 little	 bit
snotty.”
“Johnny!	
Rude!”
Meredith	 pretended	 to	 push
him.	He	ignored	her.
“I	 mean,	 your	 sister...
Amma,	 right?”	 I	 nodded	 tohim.	 “She	 was	 actually
friends	with	her	for	a	little	bit.
They’d	 run	 around	 in	 the
woods,	 Natalie’d	 come	 back
all	scraped	up	and	daffy.”
“Really?”	Considering	the
scorn	 with	 which	 she’d
mentioned	 Natalie’s	 name,	 I
couldn’t	picture	it.
“They	 were	 real	 intense
for	 a	 little	 bit.	 But	 I	 think
Amma	 got	 bored	 with	 her,
Natalie	 being	 a	 few	 years
younger.	 I	 don’t	 know.	 Theyhad	some	sort	of	falling	out.”
Amma	 learned	 that	 from	 her
mother—the	 glib	 discarding
of	 friends.	 “It	 was	 okay,
though,”	 John	 said,	 as	 if	 to
reassure	 me.	 Or	 him.	 “She
had	one	kid	she	played	with	a
lot,	James	Capisi.	Farm	kid	a
year	 or	 so	 younger	 that	 no
one	 else	 talked	 to.	 They
seemed	to	get	along	though.”
“He	says	he’s	the	last	one
to	see	Natalie	alive,”	I	said.
“He’s	 a	 liar,”	 Meredithsaid.	 “I	 heard	 that	 story,	 too.
He’s	 always	 made	 stuff	 up.	 I
mean,	 his	 mom’s	 dying	 of
cancer.	 He’s	 got	 no	 dad.	 He
has	 no	 one	 to	 pay	 any
attention	to	him.	So	he	throws
out	 that	 wild	 story.	 Don’t
listen	to	anything	he	says.”
Again	 I	 looked	 at	 John,
who	shrugged.
“It	is	sort	of	a	wild	story,
you	 know?	 A	 crazy	 lady
snatches	 Natalie	 in	 broad
daylight,”	 he	 said.	 “Besides,why	 would	 a	 woman	 do
something	like	that?”
“Why	 would	 a	 man	 do
something	like	that?”	I	asked.
“Who	knows	why	men	do
such	 freaky	 stuff,”	 Meredith
added.	“It’s	a	gene	thing.”
“I	 have	 to	 ask	 you	 John,
have	 you	 been	 questioned	 by
the	police?”
“Along	 with	 both	 my
parents.”
“And	 you	 have	 an	 alibi
for	 the	 nights	 of	 bothkillings?”	 I	 waited	 for	 a
reaction,	 but	 he	 continued	 to
sip	his	tea	calmly.
“Nope.	 I	 was	 out	 driving
around.	I	just	need	to	get	out
of	 here	 sometimes,	 you
know?”	 He	 darted	 a	 quick
glance	 at	 Meredith,	 whose
lips	 pursed	 when	 she	 caught
him	 looking.	 “It’s	 just	 a
smaller	 town	 than	 I’m	 used
to.	 Sometimes	 you	 need	 to
get	 lost	 for	 a	 little.	 I	 know
you	 don’t	 get	 it,	 Mer.”Meredith	stayed	silent.
“I	 get	 it,”	 I	 offered.	 “I
remember	 getting	 very
claustrophobic	 growing	 up
here,	 I	 can’t	 imagine	 what	 it
must	 be	 like	 to	 move	 here
from	somewhere	else.”
“Johnny’s	 being	 noble,”
Meredith	 interrupted.	 “He
was	 with	 me	 both	 those
nights.	 He	 just	 doesn’t	 want
to	 get	 me	 in	 trouble.	 Print
that.”	Meredith	was	wobbling
on	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 sofa,	 stiffand	 upright	 and	 slightly
disconnected,	 as	 if	 she	 were
speaking	in	tongues.
“Meredith,”	
John
murmured.	“No.”
“I’m	 not	 going	 to	 have
people	thinking	my	boyfriend
is	a	fucking	baby	killer,	thank
you	very	much,	John.”
“You	tell	that	story	to	the
police,	 and	 they’ll	 know	 the
truth	 in	 an	 hour.	 It	 will	 look
even	 worse	 for	 me.	 No	 one
really	 thinks	 I’d	 kill	 my	 ownsister.”	 John	 took	 a	 single
lock	 of	 Meredith’s	 hair	 and
pulled	his	fingers	gently	from
the	roots	to	the	end.	The	word
tickle	 flashed	 randomly	 from
my	 right	 hip.	 I	 believed	 the
boy.	 He	 cried	 in	 public	 and
told	 silly	 stories	 about	 his
sister	 and	 played	 with	 his
girlfriend’s	 hair	 and	 I
believed	 him.	 I	 could	 almost
hear	 Curry	 snort	 at	 my
naiveté.
“Speaking	 of	 stories,”	 Istarted.	 “I	 need	 to	 ask	 you
about	 one.	 Is	 it	 true	 Natalie
hurt	 one	 of	 her	 classmates
back	in	Philadelphia?”
John	 froze,	 turned	 to
Meredith,	 and	 for	 the	 first
time	 he	 looked	 unpleasant.
He	 gave	 me	 a	 true	 image	 for
the	 phrase	 curled	 lips.	 His
whole	 body	 jolted	 and	 I
thought	 he’d	 bolt	 for	 the
door,	but	then	he	leaned	back
and	took	a	breath.
“Great.	 This	 is	 why	 mymom	 hates	 the	 media,”	 he
grumbled.	 “There	 was	 an
article	about	that	in	the	paper
back	 home.	 It	 was	 just	 a	 few
paragraphs.	 It	 made	 Natalie
sound	like	an	animal.”
“So	 tell	 me	 what
happened.”
He	 shrugged.	 Picked	 at	 a
nail.	 “It	 was	 in	 art	 class,	 and
the	 kids	 were	 cutting	 and
painting,	 and	 a	 little	 girl	 got
hurt.	 Natalie	 was	 a	 little	 kid
with	 a	 temper,	 and	 this	 girlwas	 sort	 of	 always	 bossing
Natalie	around.	And	one	time
Natalie	 happened	 to	 have
scissors	in	her	hand.	It	wasn’t
like	 a	 premeditated	 assault.	 I
mean,	 she	 was	 nine	 at	 the
time.”
I	 had	 a	 flash	 of	 Natalie,
that	 serious	 child	 from	 the
Keene	family	photo,	wielding
blades	 at	 a	 little	 girl’s	 eyes.
An	image	of	bright	red	blood
mingling	 unexpectedly	 with
pastel	watercolors.“What	 happened	 to	 the
little	girl?”
“They	 saved	 her	 left	 eye.
Her	right	was,	uh,	ruined.”
“Natalie	attacked	both	her
eyes?”
He	 stood	 up,	 pointing
down	 at	 me	 from	 almost	 the
same	angle	as	his	mother	had.
“Natalie	 saw	 a	 shrink	 for	 a
year	 after,	 dealing	 with	 this.
Natalie	 woke	 up	 with
nightmares	 for	 months.	 She
was	 nine.	 It	 was	 an	 accident.We	 all	 felt	 horrible.	 My	 dad
set	up	a	fund	for	the	little	girl.
We	 had	 to	 leave	 so	 Natalie
could	 start	 over.	 That’s	 why
we	 had	 to	 come	 here—Dad
took	 the	 first	 job	 he	 could
find.	We	moved	in	the	middle
of	 the	 night,	 like	 criminals.
To	this	place.	To	this	goddam
town.”
“Gee	John,	I	didn’t	realize
you	 were	 having	 such	 a
horrible	 time,”	 Meredith
murmured.He	 began	 to	 cry	 then,
sitting	back	down,	his	head	in
his	hands.
“I	 didn’t	 mean	 that	 I	 was
sorry	 I	 came	 here.	 I	 meant
I’m	 sorry	 she	 came	 here,
because	now	she’s	dead.	And
we	 were	 trying	 to	 help.	 And
she’s	dead.”	He	let	out	a	quiet
wail,	 and	 Meredith	 wrapped
her	 arms	 grudgingly	 around
him.	 “Someone	 killed	 my
sister.”
	There	would	be	no	formal
dinner	 that	 night,	 as	 Miss
Adora	 wasn’t	 feeling	 well,
Gayla	informed	me.	I	assume
it	 was	 my	 mother’s
affectation	to	request	the	Miss
in	 front	 of	 her	 name,	 and	 I
tried	 to	 imagine	 how	 the
conversation	 might	 go.
Gayla,	 the	 best	 servants	 in
the	best	households	call	their
mistresses	 by	 their	 formal
names.	 We	 want	 to	 be	 the
best,	 don’t	 we?	 Somethinglike	that.
Whether	 it	 was	 my
argument	 with	 my	 mother	 or
Amma’s	that	was	the	cause	of
the	 trouble,	 I	 wasn’t	 sure.	 I
could	 hear	 them	 bickering
like	 pretty	 birds	 in	 my
mother’s	
room,	
Adora
accusing	Amma,	correctly,	of
having	 driven	 the	 golf	 cart
without	 permission.	 Like	 all
rural	towns,	Wind	Gap	has	an
obsession	 with	 machinery.
Most	 homes	 own	 a	 car	 and	 ahalf	 for	 every	 occupant	 (the
half	 being	 an	 antique
collectible,	or	an	old	piece	of
crap	on	blocks,	depending	on
the	 income	 bracket),	 plus
boats,	 Jet	 Skis,	 scooters,
tractors,	 and,	 among	 the	 elite
of	 Wind	 Gap,	 golf	 carts,
which	 younger	 kids	 without
licenses	 use	 to	 whip	 around
town.	 Technically	 illegal,	 but
no	 one	 ever	 stops	 them.	 I
guessed	 my	 mother	 had	 tried
to	 withhold	 this	 bit	 offreedom	from	Amma	after	the
murders.	I	would	have.	Their
fight	squeaked	on	like	an	old
seesaw	 for	 nearly	 half	 an
hour.	 Don’t	 lie	 to	 me,	 little
girl....	 The	 warning	 was	 so
familiar	 it	 gave	 me	 an	 old
feeling	 of	 unease.	 So	 Amma
did	occasionally	get	caught.
When	 the	 phone	 rang,	 I
picked	 up,	 just	 so	 Amma
wouldn’t	lose	her	momentum,
and	was	surprised	to	hear	the
cheerleader	 staccato	 of	 myold	friend	Katie	Lacey.	Angie
Papermaker	 was	 having	 the
girls	 over	 for	 a	 Pity	 Party.
Drink	a	bunch	of	wine,	watch
a	 sad	 movie,	 cry,	 gossip.	 I
should	 come.	 Angie	 lived	 in
the	New	Rich	part	of	town—
huge	 mansions	 at	 the
outskirts	 of	 Wind	 Gap.
Practically	 Tennessee.	 I
couldn’t	 tell	 from	 Katie’s
voice	if	that	made	her	jealous
or	 smug.	 Knowing	 her,
probably	 a	 bit	 of	 both.	 She’dalways	been	one	of	those	girls
who	wanted	what	anyone	else
had,	 even	 if	 she	 didn’t	 want
it.
I	 knew	 when	 I	 saw	 Katie
and	her	friends	at	the	Keenes’
home	 that	 I’d	 have	 to	 submit
to	at	least	one	evening	out.	It
was	this	or	finish	transcribing
my	talk	with	John,	which	was
making	 me	 dangerously	 sad.
Plus,	 like	 Annabelle,	 Jackie,
and	 that	 catty	 group	 of	 my
mother’s	
friends,	
thisgathering	 was	 likely	 to	 yield
more	information	than	I’d	get
through	 a	 dozen	 formal
interviews.
As	 soon	 as	 she	 pulled	 up
in	 front	 of	 the	 house	 I
realized	 that	 Katie	 Lacey,
now	 Katie	 Brucker,	 had,
predictably,	 done	 well	 for
herself.	I	knew	this	both	from
the	 fact	 it	 took	 her	 just	 five
minutes	 to	 pick	 me	 up	 (turns
out	her	home	was	but	a	block
away)	 and	 what	 she	 pickedme	 up	 in:	 one	 of	 those	 huge,
stupid	 SUVs	 that	 cost	 more
than	 some	 people’s	 homes
and	 provide	 just	 as	 many
comforts.	 Behind	 my	 head,	 I
could	 hear	 the	 DVD	 player
tittering	 with	 some	 kids’
show,	 despite	 the	 absence	 of
kids.	 In	 front	 of	 me,	 the
dashboard	 navigator	 was
providing	 unnecessary	 play-
by-play	directions.
Her	
husband,	
Brad
Brucker,	 was	 studying	 at	 herfather’s	feet,	and	when	Daddy
retired,	 he’d	 take	 over	 the
business	 himself.	 They
peddled	 a	 controversial
hormone	 used	 to	 bulk	 up
chickens	
with	
horrific
rapidity.	 My	 mother	 always
sniffed	 at	 this—she’d	 never
use	 anything	 that	 put	 such	 a
stunning	rush	on	the	growing
process.	That	didn’t	mean	she
eschewed	 hormones:	 My
mother’s	 pigs	 were	 pricked
with	 chemicals	 till	 theyplumped	 and	 reddened	 like
squirting	 cherries,	 till	 their
legs	 couldn’t	 support	 their
juicy	girth.	But	it	was	done	at
a	more	leisurely	pace.
Brad	 Brucker	 was	 the
type	of	husband	to	live	where
Katie	 said,	 impregnate	 Katie
when	 she	 asked,	 buy	 Katie
the	 Pottery	 Barn	 sofa	 she
wanted,	 and	 otherwise	 shut
up.	 He	 was	 good-looking	 if
you	 looked	 at	 him	 long
enough,	and	he	had	a	dick	thesize	of	my	ring	finger.	This	I
knew	 firsthand,	 thanks	 to	 a
slightly	 mechanical	 exchange
my	 freshman	 year.	 But
apparently	 the	 tiny	 thing
worked	fine:	Katie	was	at	the
end	 of	 her	 first	 trimester	 for
her	 third	 kid.	 They	 were
going	 to	 keep	 trying	 till	 she
had	 a	 boy.	 We	 really	 want	 a
little	rascal	running	around.
Talk	 of	 me,	 Chicago,	 no
husband	 yet	 but	 fingers
crossed!	Talk	of	her,	her	hair,her	 new	 vitamin	 program,
Brad,	 her	 two	 girls,	 Emma
and	 Mackenzie,	 Wind	 Gap
ladies’	 auxiliary,	 and	 the
horrible	job	they	did	with	the
St.	 Patrick’s	 Day	 Parade.
Then	 sigh:	 those	 poor	 little
girls.	 Yes,	 sigh:	 my	 story	 on
those	 poor	 little	 girls.
Apparently	 she	 didn’t	 care
that	 much,	 because	 she	 was
quickly	 back	 to	 the	 ladies’
auxiliary	and	how	scattered	it
had	 become	 now	 that	 BeccaHart	 (née	 Mooney)	 was
activities	 director.	 Becca	 was
a	 girl	 of	 midtier	 popularity
from	 our	 days,	 who	 shot	 to
social	stardom	five	years	ago
when	 she	 snagged	 Eric	 Hart,
whose	 parents	 owned	 a
sprawling	
Go-Kart,
waterslide,	 mini-golf	 tourist
trap	 in	 the	 ugliest	 part	 of	 the
Ozarks.	 The	 situation	 was
quite	 reproachable.	 She’d	 be
there	 tonight	 and	 I	 could	 see
for	myself.	She	just	didn’t	fitin.
Angie’s	house	looked	like
a	 child’s	 drawing	 of	 a
mansion:	 It	 was	 so	 generic	 it
was	barely	three-dimensional.
When	 I	 entered	 the	 room	 I
realized	 how	 much	 I	 didn’t
want	 to	 be	 there.	 There	 was
Angie,	 who’d	 unnecessarily
dropped	 ten	 pounds	 since
high	 school,	 and	 who	 smiled
demurely	 at	 me	 and	 went
back	 to	 setting	 out	 a	 fondue.
There	 was	 Tish,	 who’d	 beenthe	little	mommy	of	the	group
even	 back	 then,	 the	 one	 who
held	 your	 hair	 when	 you
threw	 up,	 and	 who	 had
occasional	 dramatic	 crying
jags	 about	 feeling	 unloved.
She’d	 married	 a	 guy	 from
Newcastle,	 I	 learned,	 a
slightly	 dorky	 man	 (this	 in
hushed	 tones	 from	 Katie)
who	 made	 a	 solid	 living.
Mimi	 draped	 herself	 over	 a
chocolate-leather	 couch.	 A
dazzling	adolescent,	her	looksdidn’t	
translate	
into
adulthood.	 No	 one	 else
seemed	 to	 notice.	 Everyone
still	referred	to	her	as	“the	hot
one.”	 Backing	 this	 up:	 the
giant	 rock	 on	 her	 hand,
courtesy	 of	 Joey	 Johansen,	 a
gangly,	 sweet	 boy	 who’d
sprouted	 into	 a	 linebacker
junior	 year,	 and	 suddenly
demanded	 to	 be	 called	 Jo-ha.
(That’s	 truly	 all	 I	 remember
of	 him.)	 Poor	 Becca	 sat
amidst	 them,	 looking	 eagerand	awkward,	dressed	almost
comically	 similar	 to	 her
hostess	 (Had	 Angie	 taken
Becca	 shopping?).	 She
flashed	smiles	to	anyone	who
caught	 her	 eye,	 but	 no	 one
talked	to	her.
We	watched	Beaches.
Tish	 was	 sobbing	 when
Angie	turned	the	lights	on.
“I’ve	gone	back	to	work,”
she	 announced	 in	 a	 wail,
pressed	coral	pink	fingernails
across	her	eyes.	Angie	pouredwine	 and	 patted	 her	 knee,
stared	 at	 her	 with	 a	 showy
concern.
“Good	 God,	 sweetie,
why?”	Katie	murmured.	Even
her	 murmur	 was	 girlish	 and
clicky.	 Like	 a	 thousand	 mice
nibbling	crackers.
“With	Tyler	in	preschool,
I	 thought	 I	 wanted	 to,”	 Tish
said	 between	 sobs.	 “Like	 I
needed	 a	 purpose.”	 She	 spat
the	last	word	out	as	if	it	were
contaminated.“You	 have	 a	 purpose,”
said	Angie.	“Don’t	let	society
tell	 you	 how	 to	 raise	 your
family.	Don’t	let	feminists”—
here	 she	 looked	 at	 me
—“make	 you	 feel	 guilty	 for
having	what	they	can’t	have.”
“She’s	 right,	 Tish,	 she’s
completely	 right,”	 offered
Becca.	 “Feminism	 means
allowing	 women	 to	 make
whatever	kind	of	choices	they
want.”
The	 women	 were	 lookingdubiously	 at	 Becca	 when
suddenly	Mimi’s	sobs	popped
up	 from	 her	 corner,	 and	 the
attention,	 and	 Angie-with-
the-wine,	turned	to	her.
“Steven	 doesn’t	 want	 to
have	 any	 more	 kids,”	 she
wept.
“Why	 not?”	 Katie	 said
with	 impressively	 strident
outrage.
“He	says	three’s	enough.”
“Enough	 for	 him	 or	 for
you?”	Katie	snapped.“That’s	 what	 I	 said.	 I
want	 a	 girl.	 I	 want	 a
daughter.”	 The	 women	 pet
her	 hair.	 Katie	 pet	 her	 belly.
“And	 I	 want	 a	 son,”	 she
whimpered,	 staring	 pointedly
at	the	photo	of	Angie’s	three-
year-old	boy	on	the	mantel.
The	 weeping	 and	 fretting
went	 back	 and	 forth	 between
Tish	 and	 Mimi—I	 miss	 my
babies...I’ve	 always	 dreamed
of	 a	 big	 houseful	 of	 kids,
that’s	 all	 I’ve	 ever	 wanted...what’s	 so	 wrong	 with	 just
being	 a	 mommy?	 I	 felt	 sorry
for	 them—they	 seemed	 truly
distraught—and	 I	 certainly
could	 sympathize	 with	 a	 life
that	 didn’t	 turn	 out	 as
planned.	But	after	much	head
nodding	 and	 murmurs	 of
assent,	 I	 could	 think	 of
nothing	 useful	 to	 say	 and	 I
ducked	 into	 the	 kitchen	 to
slice	 some	 cheese	 and	 stay
out	 of	 the	 way.	 I	 knew	 this
ritual	from	high	school,	and	Iknew	 it	 didn’t	 take	 much	 for
it	 to	 turn	 nasty.	 Becca	 soon
joined	 me	 in	 the	 kitchen,
began	washing	dishes.
“This	 happens	 pretty
much	 every	 week,”	 she	 said
and	 half	 rolled	 her	 eyes,
pretending	to	be	less	annoyed
than	bemused.
“Cathartic,	 I	 guess,”	 I
offered.	 I	 could	 sense	 her
wanting	 me	 to	 say	 more.	 I
knew	 the	 feeling.	 When	 I’m
on	the	edge	of	getting	a	goodquote,	 it	 seems	 like	 I	 can
almost	 reach	 inside	 the
person’s	 mouth	 and	 pluck	 it
off	their	tongue.
“I	had	no	idea	my	life	was
so	 miserable	 until	 I	 started
coming	 to	 Angie’s	 little	 get-
togethers,”	 Becca	 whispered,
taking	a	newly	clean	knife	to
slice	 some	 Gruyere.	 We	 had
enough	 cheese	 to	 feed	 all	 of
Wind	Gap	quite	prettily.
“Ah,	
well,	
being
conflicted	means	you	can	livea	 shallow	 life	 without
copping	 to	 being	 a	 shallow
person.”
“Sounds	 about	 right,”
Becca	 said.	 “Was	 it	 like	 this
with	 you	 guys	 in	 high
school?”	she	asked.
“Oh	 pretty	 much,	 when
we	 weren’t	 stabbing	 each
other	in	the	back.”
“Guess	 I’m	 glad	 I	 was
such	 a	 loser,”	 she	 said,	 and
laughed.	 “Wonder	 how	 I	 can
be	 less	 cool	 now?”	 I	 laughedthen	too,	poured	her	a	glass	of
wine,	 slightly	 giddy	 at	 the
absurdity	 of	 finding	 myself
plopped	 right	 back	 in	 my
teenage	life.
By	 the	 time	 we	 returned,
still	 lightly	 giggling,	 every
woman	 in	 the	 room	 was
crying,	and	they	all	stared	up
at	 us	 simultaneously,	 like	 a
gruesome	 Victorian	 portrait
come	to	life.
“Well,	 I’m	 glad	 you	 two
are	 having	 such	 fun,”	 Katiesnapped.
“Considering	
what’s
going	on	in	our	town,”	Angie
added.	 The	 subject	 had
clearly	widened.
“What’s	 wrong	 with	 the
world?	 Why	 would	 someone
hurt	 little	 girls?”	 Mimi	 cried.
“Those	poor	things.”
“And	 to	 take	 their	 teeth,
that’s	 what	 I	 can’t	 get	 over,”
Katie	said.
“I	 just	 wish	 they’d	 been
treated	 nicer	 when	 they	 werealive,”	 Angie	 sobbed.	 “Why
are	 girls	 so	 cruel	 to	 each
other?”
“The	 girls	 picked	 on
them?”	Becca	asked.
“They	cornered	Natalie	in
the	bathroom	after	school	one
day...and	 cut	 her	 hair	 off,”
Mimi	 sobbed.	 Her	 face	 was
wrecked,	
swollen	
and
splotchy.	 Dark	 rivulets	 of
mascara	marked	her	blouse.
“They	 made	 Ann	 show
her...privates	 to	 the	 boys,”said	Angie.
“They	 always	 picked	 on
those	 girls,	 just	 because	 they
were	 a	 little	 different,”	 Katie
said,	 wiping	 her	 tears
delicately	on	a	cuff.
“Who’s	 ‘they’?”	 Becca
asked.
“Ask	 Camille,	 she’s	 the
one	 reporting	 this	 whole
thing,”	 Katie	 said,	 lifting	 her
chin	 up,	 a	 gesture	 I
remembered	 from	 high
school.	 It	 meant	 she	 wasturning	 on	 you,	 but	 feeling
quite	 justified.	 “You	 know
how	 awful	 your	 sister	 is,
right,	Camille?”
“I	 know	 girls	 can	 be
miserable.”
“So	 you’re	 defending
her?”	Katie	glowered.	I	could
feel	myself	getting	pulled	into
Wind	 Gap	 politics	 and	 I
panicked.	 Catfight	 began
thumping	on	my	calf.
“Oh,	 Katie,	 I	 don’t	 even
know	 her	 well	 enough	 todefend	 or	 not	 defend	 her,”	 I
said,	faking	weariness.
“Have	 you	 even	 cried
once	about	those	little	girls?”
Angie	said.	They	were	all	in	a
bunch	now,	staring	me	down.
“Camille	 doesn’t	 have
any	 children,”	 Katie	 said
piously.	 “I	 don’t	 think	 she
can	feel	that	hurt	the	way	we
do.”
“I	 feel	 very	 sad	 about
those	 girls,”	 I	 said,	 but	 it
sounded	 artificial,	 like	 abeauty	 contestant	 pledging
world	 peace.	 I	 did	 feel	 sad,
but	 articulating	 it	 seemed
cheap	to	me.
“I	 don’t	 mean	 this	 to
sound	 cruel,”	 Tish	 began,
“but	it	seems	like	part	of	your
heart	 can	 never	 work	 if	 you
don’t	 have	 kids.	 Like	 it	 will
always	be	shut	off.”
“I	 agree,”	 Katie	 said.	 “I
didn’t	 really	 become	 a
woman	until	I	felt	Mackenzie
inside	me.	I	mean,	there’s	allthis	 talk	 these	 days	 of	 God
versus	 science,	 but	 it	 seems
like,	 with	 babies,	 both	 sides
agree.	 The	 Bible	 says	 be
fruitful	 and	 multiply,	 and
science,	well,	when	it	all	boils
down,	 that’s	 what	 women
were	made	for,	right?	To	bear
children.”
“Girl	 power,”	 Becca
muttered	under	her	breath.
	
Becca	 took	 me	 home
because	 Katie	 wanted	 asleepover	 at	 Angie’s.	 Guess
the	 nanny	 would	 deal	 with
her	 darling	 girls	 in	 the
morning.	 Becca	 made	 a	 few
game	 jokes	 about	 the
women’s	 obsession	 with
mothering,	
which	
I
acknowledged	 with	 small
croaks	 of	 laughter.	 Easy	 for
you	to	say,	you	have	two	kids.
I	 was	 feeling	 desperately
sulky.
I	 put	 on	 a	 clean
nightgown	and	sat	squarely	inthe	 center	 of	 my	 bed.	 No
more	booze	for	you	tonight,	I
whispered.	I	patted	my	cheek
and	
unclenched	
my
shoulders.	 I	 called	 myself
sweetheart.	 I	 wanted	 to	 cut:
Sugar	 flared	 on	 my	 thigh,
nasty	burned	near	my	knee.	I
wanted	 to	 slice	 barren	 into
my	skin.	That’s	how	I’d	stay,
my	 insides	 unused.	 Empty
and	 pristine.	 I	 pictured	 my
pelvis	 split	 open,	 to	 reveal	 a
tidy	hollow,	like	the	nest	of	avanished	animal.
Those	 little	 girls.	 What’s
wrong	 with	 the	 world?	Mimi
had	 cried,	 and	 it	 had	 barely
registered,	 the	 lament	 was	 so
commonplace.	 But	 I	 felt	 it
now.	 Something	 was	 wrong,
right	 here,	 very	 horribly
wrong.	 I	 could	 picture	 Bob
Nash	 sitting	 on	 the	 edge	 of
Ann’s	 bed,	 trying	 to
remember	 the	 last	 thing	 he
said	 to	 his	 daughter.	 I	 saw
Natalie’s	 mother,	 crying	 intoone	of	her	old	T-shirts.	I	saw
me,	 a	 despairing	 thirteen-
year-old	sobbing	on	the	floor
of	 my	 dead	 sister’s	 room,
holding	 a	 small	 flowered
shoe.	 Or	 Amma,	 thirteen
herself,	a	woman-child	with	a
gorgeous	body	and	a	gnawing
desire	 to	 be	 the	 baby	 girl	 my
mother	 mourned.	 My	 mother
weeping	 over	 Marian.	 Biting
that	 baby.	 Amma,	 asserting
her	 power	 over	 lesser
creatures,	laughing	as	she	andher	 friends	 cut	 through
Natalie’s	 hair,	 the	 curls
falling	 to	 the	 tile	 floor.
Natalie,	 stabbing	 at	 the	 eyes
of	 a	 little	 girl.	 My	 skin	 was
screaming,	 my	 ears	 banged
with	 my	 heartbeat.	 I	 closed
my	 eyes,	 wrapped	 my	 arms
around	myself,	and	wept.
	
After	 ten	 minutes	 of
sobbing	 in	 my	 pillow,	 I
started	 pulling	 out	 of	 the
crying	jag,	mundane	thoughtsbobbing	 into	 my	 head:	 the
quotes	 from	 John	 Keene	 I
might	 use	 in	 my	 article,	 the
fact	that	my	rent	was	due	next
week	 back	 in	 Chicago,	 the
smell	of	the	apple	going	sour
in	the	trash	basket	by	my	bed.
Then,	 outside	 my	 door,
Amma	 quietly	 whispered	 my
name.	I	buttoned	up	the	top	of
my	 nightgown,	 pulled	 my
sleeves	 down,	 and	 let	 her	 in.
She	 was	 wearing	 a	 pink
flowered	 nightgown,	 herblonde	 hair	 flowing	 over	 her
shoulders,	 her	 feet	 bare.	 She
looked	 truly	 adorable,	 no
better	word.
“You’ve	 been	 crying,”
she	said,	slightly	astounded.
“A	little.”
“Because	 of	 her?”	 The
final	 word	 was	 weighted,	 I
could	 picture	 it	 round	 and
heavy,	 making	 a	 deep	 thump
in	a	pillow.
“A	little,	I	guess.”
“Me,	 too.”	 She	 stared	 atmy	 edges:	 the	 collar	 of	 my
nightgown,	 the	 ends	 of	 my
sleeves.	 She	 was	 trying	 to
glimpse	 my	 scars.	 “I	 didn’t
know	 you	 hurt	 yourself,”	 she
said	finally.
“Not	anymore.”
“That’s	 good,	 I	 guess.”
She	 wavered	 at	 the	 edge	 of
my	 bed.	 “Camille,	 do	 you
ever	 feel	 like	 bad	 things	 are
going	 to	 happen,	 and	 you
can’t	stop	them?	You	can’t	do
anything,	 you	 just	 have	 towait?”
“Like	 an	 anxiety	 attack?”
I	 couldn’t	 stop	 staring	 at	 her
skin,	 it	 was	 so	 smooth	 and
tawny,	like	warm	ice	cream.
“No.	 Not	 really.”	 She
sounded	like	I’d	disappointed
her,	 failed	 to	 solve	 a	 clever
riddle.	 “But,	 anyway.	 I
brought	 you	 a	 present.”	 She
held	out	a	square	of	wrapping
paper	 and	 told	 me	 to	 open	 it
carefully.	 Inside:	 a	 tidily
rolled	joint.“It’s	 better	 than	 that
vodka	 you	 drink,”	 Amma
said,	automatically	defensive.
“You	 drink	 a	 lot.	 This	 is
better.	 It	 won’t	 make	 you	 as
sad.”
“Amma,	really...”
“Can	 I	 see	 your	 cuts
again?”	She	smiled	shyly.
“No.”	A	silence.	I	held	up
the	 joint.	 “And	 Amma,	 I
don’t	think	you	should...”
“Well	 I	 do,	 so	 take	 it	 or
don’t.	 I	 was	 just	 trying	 to	 benice.”	 She	 frowned	 and
twisted	 a	 corner	 of	 her
nightgown.
“Thank	 you.	 It’s	 sweet
that	you’d	like	to	help	me	feel
better.”
“I	 can	 be	 nice,	 you
know?”	 she	 said,	 her	 brow
still	furrowed.	She	seemed	on
the	edge	of	tears	herself.
“I	know.	It’s	just	that	I’m
wondering	 why	 you’ve
decided	 to	 be	 nice	 to	 me
now.”“Sometimes	 I	 can’t.	 But
right	 now,	 I	 can.	 When
everyone’s	
asleep	
and
everything’s	
quiet,	
it’s
easier.”	 She	 reached	 out,	 her
hand	 like	 a	 butterfly	 before
my	 face,	 then	 dropped	 it,
patted	 me	 on	 the	 knee,	 and
left.	
Chapter	Ten
“I’m	 sorry	 she
came	 here,	 because
now	she’s	dead,”	said	a
weeping	 John	 Keene,
18,	 of	 his	 younger
sister	 Natalie,	 10.
“Someone	 killed	 my
little	 sister.”	 Natalie
Keene’s	 body	 was
discovered	 on	 May	 14,
jammed	 upright	 in	 aspace	 between	 Cut-N-
Curl	 Beauty	 Parlor	 and
Bifty’s	Hardware	in	the
small	 town	 of	 Wind
Gap,	 Mo.	 She	 is	 the
second	 young	 girl
murdered	 here	 in	 the
past	 nine	 months:	 Ann
Nash,	
nine,	
was
discovered	 in	 a	 nearby
creek	last	August.	Both
girls	
had	
been
strangled;	 both	 had
their	 teeth	 removed	 bythe	killer.
“She	was	this	goofy
kid,”	 John	 Keene	 said,
crying	softly,	“kind	of	a
tomboy.”	 Keene,	 who
moved	 here	 from
Philadelphia	 with	 his
family	 two	 years	 ago,
and	 who	 recently
graduated	 from	 high
school,	 described	 his
younger	 sister	 as	 a
bright,	imaginative	girl.
She	once	even	inventedher	 own	 language,
complete	
with	
a
working	 alphabet.	 “A
regular	 kid,	 it’d	 be
gibberish,”	 Keene	 said,
laughing	ruefully.
What	is	gibberish	is
the	 police	 case	 so	 far:
Wind	 Gap	 police
officials	 and	 Richard
Willis,	 a	 homicide
detective	 on	 loan	 from
Kansas	 City,	 admit
there	 are	 few	 leads.“We	 have	 not	 ruled
anyone	 out,”	 Willis
said.	 “We	 are	 looking
very	closely	at	potential
suspects	 within	 the
community,	 but	 are
also	
carefully
considering	
the
possibility	 that	 these
killings	 may	 be	 the
work	of	an	outsider.”
The	police	refuse	to
comment	 on	 one
potential	 witness,	 ayoung	 boy	 who	 claims
he	 saw	 the	 person	 who
abducted	
Natalie
Keene:	 a	 woman.	 A
source	 close	 to	 the
police	 say	 they	 believe
the	 killer	 is,	 in	 fact,
likely	 to	 be	 a	 man
within	
the	
local
community.	 Wind	 Gap
dentist	
James	
L.
Jellard,	 56,	 concurs,
adding	 that	 removing
teeth	“would	take	somestrength.	 They	 don’t
just	pop	right	out.”
While	 the	 police
work	 the	 case,	 Wind
Gap	 has	 seen	 a	 run	 on
security	 locks	 and
firearms.	 The	 local
hardware	store	has	sold
three	 dozen	 security
locks;	 the	 town’s	 gun
and	 rifle	 dealer	 has
processed	more	than	30
firearms	 permits	 since
Keene’s	 killing.	 “Ithought	 most	 folks
around	 here	 already
had	rifles,	for	hunting,”
says	 Dan	 R.	 Sniya,	 35,
who	 owns	 the	 town’s
largest	 firearms	 store.
“But	 I	 think	 anyone
who	 didn’t	 have	 a	 gun
—well,	they	will.”
One	 Wind	 Gap
resident	
who’s
increased	 his	 arsenal	 is
Ann	 Nash’s	 father,
Robert,	41.	“I	have	twoother	 daughters	 and	 a
son,	 and	 they’re	 going
to	 be	 protected,”	 he
said.	 Nash	 described
his	 late	 daughter	 as
quite	
bright.
“Sometimes	 I	 thought
she	 was	 smarter	 than
her	
old	
man.
Sometimes	she	 thought
she	 was	 smarter	 than
her	 old	 man.”	 He	 said
his	 daughter	 was	 a
tomboy	 like	 Natalie,	 agirl	who	liked	to	climb
trees	 and	 ride	 her	 bike,
which	 is	 what	 she	 was
doing	 when	 she	 was
abducted	last	August.
Father	 Louis	 D.
Bluell,	 of	 the	 local
Catholic	 parish,	 says
he’s	 seen	 the	 effect	 of
the	
murders	
on
residents:	 Sunday	 mass
attendance	
has
increased	 noticeably,
and	 many	 members	 ofhis	 church	 have	 come
for	 spiritual	 advice.
“When	 something	 like
this	 happens,	 people
feel	 a	 real	 yearning	 for
spiritual	 nourishment,”
he	 says.	 “They	 want	 to
know	 how	 something
like	 this	 could	 have
happened.”
So,	 too,	 do	 the
police.
	
Before	we	hit	press,	Currymade	 fun	 of	 all	 the	 middle
initials.	
Good	
God,
Southerners	
love	
their
formalities.	 I	 pointed	 out
Missouri	 was	 technically	 the
Midwest	 and	 he	 snickered	 at
me.	 And	 I’m	 technically
middle-aged,	 but	 tell	 that	 to
poor	 Eileen	 when	 she	 has	 to
deal	with	my	bursitis.	He	also
excised	 all	 but	 the	 most
general	 details	 from	 my
interview	 with	 James	 Capisi.
Makes	us	look	like	suckers	ifwe	pay	too	much	attention	to
the	 kid,	 especially	 if	 the
police	 aren’t	 biting.	 He	 also
cut	 a	 lame	 quote	 about	 John
from	 his	 mother:	 “He’s	 a
kind,	 gentle	 boy.”	 It	 was	 the
only	comment	I	got	from	her
before	 she	 kicked	 me	 out	 of
the	house,	the	only	thing	that
made	that	miserable	visit	near
worthwhile,	
but	
Curry
thought	it	was	distracting.	He
was	 probably	 right.	 He	 was
quite	 pleased	 that	 we	 finallyhad	a	suspect	to	focus	on,	my
“man	 within	 the	 local
community.”	 My	 “source
close	 to	 the	 police”	 was	 a
fabrication,	
or	
more
euphemistically,	 an	 amalgam
—everyone	 from	 Richard	 to
the	priest	thought	a	local	guy
did	 it.	 I	 didn’t	 tell	 Curry
about	my	lie.
The	 morning	 my	 story
came	out,	I	stayed	in	bed	and
stared	 at	 the	 white	 rotary
phone,	 waited	 for	 it	 to	 ringwith	 rebukes.	 It	 would	 be
John’s	mom,	who’d	be	plenty
angry	 when	 she	 discovered	 I
got	 to	 her	 son.	 Or	 Richard,
for	my	leak	about	the	suspect
being	local.
Several	 silent	 hours	 went
by	 as	 I	 got	 progressively
more	 sweaty,	 the	 horseflies
buzzing	 around	 my	 window
screen,	 Gayla	 hovering
outside	 my	 door,	 anxious	 for
access	 to	 my	 room.	 Our
bedclothes	 and	 bath	 towelshave	 always	 been	 changed
daily;	 the	 laundry	 is	 forever
churning	 down	 in	 the
basement.	 I	 think	 this	 is	 a
lingering	habit	from	Marian’s
lifetime.	 Crisp	 clean	 clothes
to	make	us	forget	all	the	drips
and	 dank	 smells	 that	 come
from	 our	 bodies.	 I	 was	 in
college	by	the	time	I	realized
I	 liked	 the	 smell	 of	 sex.	 I
came	 into	 my	 friend’s
bedroom	one	morning	after	a
boy	 darted	 past	 me,	 smilingsideways	 and	 tucking	 his
socks	 into	 his	 back	 pocket.
She	 was	 lazing	 in	 bed,
splotchy	and	naked,	with	one
bare	 leg	 dangling	 out	 from
under	 the	 sheets.	 That	 sweet
muddy	 smell	 was	 purely
animal,	 like	 the	 deepest
corner	of	a	bear’s	cave.	It	was
almost	 foreign	 to	 me,	 this
lived-in,	 overnight	 odor.	 My
most	 evocative	 childhood
scent	was	bleach.
As	 it	 turned	 out,	 my	 firstangry	 caller	 was	 not	 anyone
I’d	guessed.
“I	 can’t	 believe	 you	 left
me	 completely	 out	 of	 the
story,”	 Meredith	 Wheeler’s
voice	clanged	into	the	phone.
“You	 didn’t	 use	 one	 thing	 I
said.	You’d	never	even	know
I	 was	 there.	 I	 was	 the	 one
who	
got	
you	
John,
remember?”
“Meredith,	 I	 never	 told
you	 I’d	 use	 your	 comments,”
I	 said,	 irritated	 at	 herpushiness.	 “I’m	 sorry	 if	 you
got	 that	 impression.”	 I
jammed	 a	 floppy	 blue	 teddy
bear	under	my	head,	then	felt
guilty	and	returned	him	to	the
foot	 of	 the	 bed.	 One	 should
have	 allegiance	 to	 one’s
childhood	things.
“I	 just	 don’t	 know	 why
you	 wouldn’t	 include	 me,”
she	 continued.	 “If	 the	 whole
thing	was	to	get	an	idea	what
Natalie	 was	 like,	 then	 you
need	 John.	 And	 if	 you	 needJohn,	 you	 need	 me.	 I’m	 his
girlfriend.	 I	 mean,	 I
practically	 own	 him,	 ask
anyone.”
“Well,	you	and	John,	that
wasn’t	really	the	focus	of	the
story,”	 I	 said.	 Behind
Meredith’s	 breathing,	 I	 could
hear	 a	 country-rock	 ballad
playing	and	a	rhythmic	thump
and	hiss.
“But	you	had	other	people
from	 Wind	 Gap	 in	 the	 story.
You	had	stupid	Father	Bluell.Why	 not	 me?	 John’s	 in	 a	 lot
of	 pain,	 and	 I’ve	 been	 really
important	 to	 him,	 working
through	 it	 all	 with	 him.	 He
cries	all	the	time.	I’m	the	one
keeping	him	together.”
“When	I	do	another	story
that	 needs	 more	 voices	 from
Wind	Gap,	I’ll	interview	you.
If	you	have	something	to	add
to	the	story.”
Thump.	 Hiss.	 She	 was
ironing.
“I	 know	 a	 lot	 about	 thatfamily,	 a	 lot	 about	 Natalie
that	 John	 wouldn’t	 think	 of.
Or	say.”
“Great,	 then.	 I’ll	 be	 in
touch.	 Soon.”	 I	 hung	 up,	 not
quite	 easy	 with	 what	 the	 girl
was	 offering	 me.	 When	 I
looked	 down,	 I	 realized	 I’d
written	 “Meredith”	 in	 loopy
girlish	 cursive	 across	 the
scars	on	my	left	leg.
On	the	porch,	Amma	was
swaddled	 in	 a	 pink	 silk
comforter,	 a	 damp	 washclothon	 her	 forehead.	 My	 mother
had	 a	 silver	 tray	 with	 tea,
toast,	 and	 assorted	 bottles	 on
it,	 and	 was	 pressing	 the	 back
of	 Amma’s	 hand	 against	 her
cheek	in	a	circular	motion.
“Baby,	 baby,	 baby,”
Adora	 murmured,	 rocking
them	both	on	the	swing.
Amma	 lolled	 sleepy	 as	 a
newborn	 in	 her	 blanket,
smacking	
her	
lips
occasionally.	 It	 was	 the	 first
time	 I’d	 seen	 my	 mothersince	our	trip	to	Woodberry.	I
hovered	 in	 front	 of	 her,	 but
she	wouldn’t	take	her	eyes	off
Amma.
“Hi,	 Camille,”	 Amma
finally	 whispered,	 and	 gave
me	a	little	curl	of	a	smile.
“Your	sister	is	sick.	She’s
worried	 herself	 into	 a	 fever
since	 you’ve	 been	 home,”
Adora	 said,	 still	 pressing
Amma’s	hand	in	that	circle.	I
pictured	 my	 mother’s	 teeth
gnashing	 against	 each	 otherinside	her	cheek.
Alan,	 I	 realized,	 was
sitting	 just	 inside,	 watching
them	 through	 the	 window
screen	 from	 the	 living-room
loveseat.
“You	 need	 to	 make	 her
feel	more	comfortable	around
you,	 Camille;	 she’s	 just	 a
little	 girl,”	 my	 mother	 cooed
to	Amma.
A	 little	 girl	 with	 a
hangover.	 Amma	 left	 my
room	 last	 night	 and	 wentdown	 to	 drink	 a	 while	 in	 her
own.	 That’s	 the	 way	 this
house	 worked.	 I	 left	 them
whispering	 to	 each	 other,
favorite	buzzing	on	my	knee.
	
“Hey,	 Scoop.”	 Richard
rolled	 along	 beside	 me	 in	 his
sedan.	 I	 was	 walking	 to	 the
space	 where	 Natalie’s	 body
had	 been	 discovered,	 to	 get
specific	 details	 about	 the
balloons	 and	 notes	 placed
there.	 Curry	 wanted	 a	 “townin	mourning”	piece.	That	is,	if
there	 were	 no	 leads	 on	 the
murders.	 Implication	 being
there	better	be	some	lead,	and
soon.
“Hello,	Richard.”
“Nice	story	today.”	Damn
Internet.	“Glad	to	hear	you’ve
found	 a	 source	 close	 to	 the
police.”	He	was	smiling	when
he	said	it.
“Me	too.”
“Get	 in,	 we’ve	 got	 some
work	to	do.”	He	pushed	openthe	passenger	door.
“I’ve	got	my	own	work	to
do.	 So	 far	 working	 with	 you
has	 given	 me	 nothing	 but
unusable,	
no-comment
comments.	My	editor’s	going
to	pull	me	out	soon.”
“Well,	we	can’t	have	that.
Then	
I’ll	
have	
no
distractions,”	 he	 said.	 “Come
on	 with	 me.	 I	 need	 a	 Wind
Gap	 tour	 guide.	 In	 return:	 I
will	 answer	 three	 questions,
completely	and	truthfully.	Offrecord	of	course,	but	I’ll	give
it	 to	 you	 straight.	 Come	 on,
Camille.	 Unless	 you’ve	 got	 a
date	with	your	police	source.”
“Richard.”
“No,	truly,	I	don’t	want	to
interfere	 with	 a	 burgeoning
love	 affair.	 You	 and	 this
mysterious	fellow	must	make
quite	a	handsome	pair.”
“Shut	up.”	I	got	in	the	car.
He	 leaned	 over	 me,	 pulled
down	 my	 seat	 belt	 and
secured	 it,	 pausing	 for	 asecond	 with	 his	 lips	 close	 to
mine.
“I’ve	 got	 to	 keep	 you
safe.”	 He	 pointed	 over	 to	 a
mylar	balloon	swaying	in	the
gap	where	Natalie’s	body	was
found.	It	read	Get	Well	Soon.
“That	 to	 me,”	 Richard
said,	 “perfectly	 sums	 up
Wind	Gap.”
	
Richard	 wanted	 me	 to
take	 him	 to	 all	 the	 town’s
secret	 places,	 the	 nooks	 thatonly	 locals	 know	 about.
Places	 where	 people	 meet	 to
screw	 or	 smoke	 dope,	 where
teens	drink,	or	folks	go	to	sit
by	 themselves	 and	 decide
where	 their	 lives	 had
unraveled.	 Everyone	 has	 a
moment	 where	 life	 goes	 off
the	 rails.	 Mine	 was	 the	 day
Marian	 died.	 The	 day	 I
picked	up	that	knife	is	a	tight
second.
“We	 still	 haven’t	 found	 a
kill	 site	 for	 either	 girl,”Richard	said,	one	hand	on	the
wheel,	 the	 other	 draped	 on
the	back	of	my	seat.	“Just	the
dumping	 areas,	 and	 those	 are
pretty	 contaminated.”	 He
paused.	 “Sorry.	 ‘Kill	 site’	 is
an	ugly	phrase.”
“More	 suited	 to	 an
abattoir.”
“Wow.	 Fifty-cent	 word
there,	 Camille.	 Seventy-five
cents	in	Wind	Gap.”
“Yeah,	 I	 forget	 how
cultured	 you	 Kansas	 Cityfolks	are.”
I	directed	Richard	onto	an
unmarked	 gravel	 road,	 and
we	 parked	 in	 the	 knee-length
weeds	 about	 ten	 miles	 south
of	 where	 Ann’s	 body	 had
been	found.	I	fanned	the	back
of	 my	 neck	 in	 the	 wet	 air,
plucked	 at	 my	 long	 sleeves,
stuck	to	my	arms.	I	wondered
if	 Richard	 could	 smell	 the
booze	 of	 last	 night,	 now
sitting	 in	 sweaty	 dots	 on	 my
skin.	 We	 hiked	 into	 thewoods,	downhill	and	back	up.
The	 cottonwood	 leaves
shimmered,	 as	 always,	 with
imaginary	
breeze.
Occasionally	 we	 could	 hear
an	animal	skitter	away,	a	bird
suddenly	 take	 flight.	 Richard
walked	 assuredly	 behind	 me,
plucking	 leaves	 and	 slowly
tearing	 them	 apart	 along	 the
way.	By	the	time	we	reached
the	 spot,	 our	 clothes	 were
soaked,	 my	 face	 dripping
with	 sweat.	 It	 was	 an	 ancientone-room	schoolhouse,	tilting
slightly	 to	 one	 side,	 vines
weaving	 in	 and	 out	 of	 its
slats.
Inside,	 half	 a	 chalkboard
was	 nailed	 to	 the	 wall.	 It
contained	 elaborate	 drawings
of	 penises	 pushing	 into
vaginas—no	 bodies	 attached.
Dead	 leaves	 and	 liquor
bottles	littered	the	floor,	some
rusted	 beer	 cans	 from	 a	 time
before	 pop	 tops.	 A	 few	 tiny
desks	 remained.	 One	 wascovered	in	a	tablecloth,	a	vase
of	 dead	 roses	 at	 its	 center.	 A
pitiable	 place	 for	 a	 romantic
dinner.	I	hoped	it	went	well.
“Nice	 work,”	 Richard
said,	 pointing	 to	 one	 of	 the
crayoned	 drawings.	 His	 light
blue	 oxford	 clung	 to	 him.	 I
could	 see	 the	 outline	 of	 a
well-toned	chest.
“This	 is	 mostly	 a	 kid
hangout,	 obviously,”	 I	 said.
“But	 it’s	 near	 the	 creek,	 so	 I
thought	you	should	see	it.”“Mm-hmm.”	He	looked	at
me	 in	 silence.	 “What	 do	 you
do	 back	 in	 Chicago	 when
you’re	 not	 working?”	 He
leaned	on	the	desk,	plucked	a
withered	 rose	 from	 the	 vase,
began	crumbling	its	leaves.
“What	do	I	do?”
“Do	 you	 have	 a
boyfriend?	I	bet	you	do.”
“No.	 I	 haven’t	 had	 a
boyfriend	in	a	long	time.”
He	 began	 pulling	 the
petals	 off	 the	 rose.	 I	 couldn’ttell	if	he	was	interested	in	my
answer.	 He	 looked	 up	 at	 me
and	grinned.
“You’re	 a	 tough	 one,
Camille.	You	don’t	have	a	lot
of	give	to	you.	You	make	me
work.	 I	 like	 it,	 it’s	 different.
Most	 girls	 you	 can’t	 get	 to
shut	up.	No	offense.”
“I’m	 not	 trying	 to	 be
difficult.	 It’s	 just	 not	 the
question	 I	 was	 expecting,”	 I
said,	 regaining	 my	 footing	 in
the	 conversation.	 Small	 talkand	banter.	I	can	do	that.	“Do
you	 have	 a	 girlfriend?	 I	 bet
you	 have	 two.	 A	 blonde	 and
brunette,	 to	 coordinate	 with
your	ties.”
“Wrong	on	all	counts.	No
girlfriend,	 and	 my	 last	 one
was	 a	 redhead.	 She	 didn’t
match	anything	I	owned.	Had
to	go.	Nice	girl,	too	bad.”
Normally,	 Richard	 was
the	 kind	 of	 guy	 I	 disliked,
someone	 born	 and	 raised
plush:	 looks,	 charm,	 smarts,probably	 money.	 These	 men
were	never	very	interesting	to
me;	 they	 had	 no	 edges,	 and
they	 were	 usually	 cowards.
They	 instinctively	 fled	 any
situation	 that	 might	 cause
them	 embarrassment	 or
awkwardness.	 But	 Richard
didn’t	 bore	 me.	 Maybe
because	 his	 grin	 was	 a	 little
crooked.	Or	because	he	made
his	 living	 dealing	 in	 ugly
things.
“You	 ever	 come	 herewhen	 you	 were	 a	 kid,
Camille?”	 His	 voice	 was
quiet,	 almost	 shy.	 He	 looked
sideways,	 and	 the	 afternoon
sun	 made	 his	 hair	 glimmer
gold.
“Sure.	 Perfect	 place	 for
inappropriate	activities.”
Richard	 walked	 over	 to
me,	handed	me	the	last	of	the
rose,	 ran	 a	 finger	 up	 my
sweaty	cheek.
“I	 can	 see	 that,”	 he	 said.
“First	time	I’ve	ever	wished	Igrew	up	in	Wind	Gap.”
“You	 and	 I	 might	 have
gotten	along	just	fine,”	I	said,
and	 meant	 it.	 I	 was	 suddenly
sad	 I’d	 never	 known	 a	 boy
like	 Richard	 growing	 up,
someone	 who’d	 at	 least	 give
me	a	bit	of	a	challenge.
“You	
know	
you’re
beautiful,	 right?”	 he	 asked.
“I’d	tell	you,	but	it	seems	like
the	 kind	 of	 thing	 that	 you’d
brush	 off.	 Instead	 I
thought...”He	 tilted	 my	 head	 up	 to
him	 and	 kissed	 me,	 first
slowly	 and	 then,	 when	 I
didn’t	 pull	 away,	 he	 folded
me	 into	 his	 arms,	 pushed	 his
tongue	into	my	mouth.	It	was
the	 first	 time	 I’d	 been	 kissed
in	 almost	 three	 years.	 I	 ran
my	 hands	 between	 his
shoulder	 blades,	 the	 rose
crumbling	 down	 his	 back.	 I
pulled	 his	 collar	 away	 from
his	neck	and	licked	him.
“I	 think	 you	 are	 the	 mostbeautiful	 girl	 I	 have	 ever
seen,”	 he	 said,	 running	 a
finger	along	my	jawline.	“The
first	 time	 I	 saw	 you,	 I
couldn’t	even	think	the	rest	of
the	 day.	 Vickery	 sent	 me
home.”	He	laughed.
“I	 think	 you’re	 very
handsome,	 too,”	 I	 said,
holding	 his	 hands	 so	 they
wouldn’t	 roam.	 My	 shirt	 was
thin,	I	didn’t	want	him	to	feel
my	scars.
“I	 think	 you’re	 veryhandsome,	too?”	He	laughed.
“Geez,	 Camille,	 you	 really
don’t	 do	 the	 romance	 stuff,
huh?”
“I’m	 just	 caught	 off
guard.	I	mean,	first	of	all,	this
is	a	bad	idea,	you	and	me.”
“Horrible.”	 He	 kissed	 my
earlobe.
“And,	 I	 mean,	 don’t	 you
want	 to	 look	 around	 this
place?”
“Miss	 Preaker,	 I	 searched
this	 place	 the	 second	 week	 Iwas	here.	I	just	wanted	to	go
for	a	walk	with	you.”
Richard	 also	 had	 covered
the	 two	 other	 spots	 I	 had	 in
mind,	 as	 it	 turned	 out.	 An
abandoned	 hunting	 shed	 on
the	 south	 part	 of	 the	 woods
had	 yielded	 a	 yellow	 plaid
hair	 ribbon	 that	 neither	 girl’s
parents	 could	 identify.	 The
bluffs	 to	 the	 east	 of	 Wind
Gap,	where	you	could	sit	and
watch	 the	 distant	 Mississippi
River	below,	offered	a	child’ssneaker	 print	 that	 matched
shoes	 neither	 girl	 owned.
Some	 dried	 blood	 was	 found
dribbled	 over	 grass	 blades;
but	 the	 type	 was	 the	 wrong
match	 for	 both.	 Once	 again	 I
was	 turning	 up	 useless.	 Then
again,	Richard	didn’t	seem	to
care.	 We	 drove	 up	 to	 the
bluffs	anyway,	grabbed	a	six-
pack	 of	 beer	 and	 sat	 in	 the
sun,	watching	the	Mississippi
River	 glimmer	 gray	 like	 a
lazy	snake.This	 had	 been	 one	 of
Marian’s	favorite	places	to	go
when	she	could	leave	her	bed.
For	an	instant,	I	could	feel	the
weight	 of	 her	 as	 a	 child	 on
my	 back,	 her	 hot	 giggles	 in
my	 ears,	 skinny	 arms
wrapped	 tight	 around	 my
shoulders.
“Where	would	you	take	a
little	 girl	 to	 strangle	 her?”
Richard	asked.
“My	 car	 or	 my	 home,”	 I
said,	jolting	back.“And	 to	 pull	 out	 the
teeth?”
“Somewhere	 that	 I	 could
scrub	 down	 well.	 A
basement.	 A	 bathtub.	 The
girls	were	dead	first,	right?”
“Is	 that	 one	 of	 your
questions?”
“Sure.”
“They	were	both	dead.”
“Dead	 long	 enough	 there
was	 no	 blood	 when	 the	 teeth
came	out?”
A	barge	floating	down	theriver	 began	 turning	 sideways
in	 the	 current;	 men	 appeared
on	 board	 with	 longpoles	 to
twist	 it	 back	 in	 the	 right
direction.
“With	 Natalie	 there	 was
blood.	 The	 teeth	 were
removed	 immediately	 after
the	strangling.”
I	had	the	image	of	Natalie
Keene,	 brown	 eyes	 frozen
open,	 slumped	 down	 in	 a
bathtub	as	someone	pried	her
teeth	 from	 her	 mouth.	 Bloodon	 Natalie’s	 chin.	 A	 hand	 on
pliers.	A	woman’s	hand.
“Do	 you	 believe	 James
Capisi?”
“I	 truly	 don’t	 know,
Camille,	and	I’m	not	blowing
smoke	 at	 you.	 The	 kid	 is
scared	 out	 of	 his	 wits.	 His
mom	 keeps	 calling	 us	 to	 put
someone	 on	 guard.	 He’s	 sure
this	 woman	 is	 going	 to	 come
get	him.	I	sweated	him	a	little
bit,	 called	 him	 a	 liar,	 tried	 to
see	 if	 he’d	 change	 his	 story.Nothing.”	 He	 turned	 to	 face
me.	 “I’ll	 tell	 you	 this:	 James
Capisi	believes	his	story.	But
I	can’t	see	how	it	can	be	true.
It	 doesn’t	 fit	 any	 kind	 of
profile	 I’ve	 ever	 heard	 of.	 It
doesn’t	 feel	 right	 to	 me.
Cop’s	 intuition.	 I	 mean,	 you
talked	 to	 him,	 what	 did	 you
think?”
“I	 agree	 with	 you.	 I
wonder	if	he	isn’t	just	freaked
out	 about	 his	 mom’s	 cancer
and	 projecting	 that	 fearsomehow.	I	don’t	know.	And
what	about	John	Keene?”
“Profilewise:	right	age,	in
the	 family	 of	 one	 of	 the
victims,	 seems	 maybe	 too
broken	 up	 over	 the	 whole
thing.”
“His	
sister	
was
murdered.”
“Right.	 But...I’m	 a	 guy
and	 I	 can	 tell	 you	 teenage
boys	 will	 sooner	 kill
themselves	than	cry	in	public.
And	 he’s	 been	 weeping	 it	 upall	 over	 town.”	 Richard	 blew
a	 hollow	 toot	 with	 his	 beer
bottle,	 a	 mating	 call	 to	 a
passing	tugboat.
	
The	 moon	 was	 out,	 the
cicadas	 in	 full	 jungle	 pulse,
when	 Richard	 dropped	 me	 at
home.	
Their	
creaking
matched	
the	
throbbing
between	my	legs	where	I’d	let
him	 touch	 me.	 Zipper	 down,
his	 hand	 guided	 by	 mine	 to
my	clitoris	and	held	there	lesthe	explore	and	bump	into	the
raised	 outlines	 of	 my	 scars.
We	 got	 each	 other	 off	 like	 a
couple	
of	
schoolkids
(dumpling	thumping	hard	and
pink	 on	 my	 left	 foot	 as	 I
came)	 and	 I	 was	 sticky	 and
smelling	 of	 sex	 as	 I	 opened
the	 door	 to	 find	 my	 mother
sitting	 on	 the	 bottom	 stair
with	 a	 pitcher	 of	 amaretto
sours.
She	 was	 wearing	 a	 pink
nightgown	with	girlish	puffedsleeves	 and	 a	 satin	 ribbon
around	 the	 neckline.	 Her
hands	 were	 unnecessarly
repacked	in	that	snowy	gauze,
which	she’d	managed	to	keep
pristine	 despite	 being	 deeply
in	 her	 cups.	 She	 swayed
slightly	as	I	came	through	the
door,	 like	 a	 ghost	 debating
whether	 to	 vanish.	 She
stayed.
“Camille.	 Come	 sit.”	 She
beckoned	 her	 cloudy	 hands
toward	 me.	 “No!	 Get	 a	 glassfirst	 from	 the	 back	 kitchen.
You	 can	 have	 a	 drink	 with
Mother.	With	your	mother.”
This	should	be	miserable,
I	 murmured	 as	 I	 grabbed	 a
tumbler.	 But	 underneath	 that,
a	 thought:	 time	 alone	 with
her!	 A	 leftover	 rattle	 from
childhood.	Get	that	fixed.
My	
mother	
poured
recklessly	
but	
perfect,
capping	 off	 my	 glass	 just
before	 it	 overflowed.	 Still,	 a
trick	 to	 get	 it	 to	 my	 mouthwithout	spilling.	She	smirked
a	 little	 as	 she	 watched	 me.
Leaned	 back	 against	 the
newel	 post,	 tucked	 her	 feet
under	her,	sipped.
“I	 think	 I	 finally	 realized
why	 I	 don’t	 love	 you,”	 she
said.
I	knew	she	didn’t,	but	I’d
never	 heard	 her	 admit	 as
much.	 I	 tried	 to	 tell	 myself	 I
was	 intrigued,	 like	 a	 scientist
on	 the	 edge	 of	 a
breakthrough,	 but	 my	 throatclosed	 up	 and	 I	 had	 to	 make
myself	breathe.
“You	 remind	 me	 of	 my
mother.	 Joya.	 Cold	 and
distant	 and	 so,	 so	 smug.	 My
mother	 never	 loved	 me,
either.	And	if	you	girls	won’t
love	me,	I	won’t	love	you.”
A	 wave	 of	 fury	 rattled
through	 me.	 “I	 never	 said	 I
didn’t	 love	 you,	 that’s	 just
ridiculous.	 Just	 fucking
ridiculous.	 You	 were	 the	 one
who	never	liked	me,	even	as	akid.	 I	 never	 felt	 anything	 but
coldness	 from	 you,	 so	 don’t
you	 dare	 turn	 this	 on	 me.”	 I
began	 rubbing	 my	 palm	 hard
on	 the	 edge	 of	 the	 stair.	 My
mother	 gave	 a	 half	 smile	 at
the	action	and	I	stopped.
“You	 were	 always	 so
willful,	 never	 sweet.	 I
remember	when	you	were	six
or	seven.	I	wanted	to	put	your
hair	 up	 in	 curlers	 for	 your
school	 picture.	 Instead	 you
cut	 it	 all	 off	 with	 my	 fabricshears.”	 I	 didn’t	 remember
doing	 this.	 I	 remembered
hearing	about	Ann	doing	this.
“I	 don’t	 think	 so,
Momma.”
“Headstrong.	 Like	 those
girls.	 I	 tried	 to	 be	 close	 with
those	girls,	those	dead	girls.”
“What	 do	 you	 mean	 be
close	with	them?”
“They	 reminded	 me	 of
you,	 running	 around	 town
wild.	 Like	 little	 pretty
animals.	 I	 thought	 if	 I	 couldbe	 close	 with	 them,	 I	 would
understand	 you	 better.	 If	 I
could	 like	 them,	 maybe	 I
could	 like	 you.	 But	 I
couldn’t.”
“No,	 I	 don’t	 expect	 so.”
The	grandfather	clock	chimed
eleven.	 I	 wonder	 how	 many
times	 my	 mother	 had	 heard
that	growing	up	in	this	house.
“When	I	had	you	inside	of
me,	 when	 I	 was	 a	 girl—so
much	 younger	 than	 you	 are
now—I	 thought	 you’d	 saveme.	I	thought	you’d	love	me.
And	 then	 my	 mother	 would
love	 me.	 That	 was	 a	 joke.”
My	 mother’s	 voice	 swept
high	and	raw,	like	a	red	scarf
in	a	storm.
“I	was	a	baby.”
“Even	from	the	beginning
you	 disobeyed,	 wouldn’t	 eat.
Like	 you	 were	 punishing	 me
for	being	born.	Made	me	look
like	a	fool.	Like	a	child.”
“You	were	a	child.”
“And	now	you	come	backand	all	I	can	think	of	is	‘Why
Marian	and	not	her?’”
Rage	
flattened
immediately	 into	 a	 dark
despair.	 My	 fingers	 found	 a
wood	staple	in	the	floorboard.
I	 jabbed	 it	 under	 my
fingernail.	I	would	not	cry	for
this	woman.
“I’m	 not	 so	 pleased	 to	 be
left	here	anyway,	Momma,	if
it	makes	you	feel	any	better.”
“You’re	so	hateful.”
“I	learned	at	your	feet.”My	 mother	 lunged	 then,
grabbed	 me	 by	 both	 arms.
Then	 she	 reached	 behind	 me
and,	 with	 one	 fingernail,
circled	 the	 spot	 on	 my	 back
that	had	no	scars.
“The	only	place	you	have
left,”	 she	 whispered	 at	 me.
Her	 breath	 was	 cloying	 and
musky,	 like	 air	 coming	 from
a	spring	well.
“Yes.”
“Someday	 I’ll	 carve	 my
name	 there.”	 She	 shook	 meonce,	 released	 me,	 then	 left
me	 on	 the	 stairs	 with	 the
warm	remains	of	our	liquor.
I	 drank	 the	 rest	 of	 the
sours	 and	 had	 dark	 sticky
dreams.	 My	 mother	 had	 cut
me	 open	 and	 was	 unpacking
my	organs,	stacking	them	in	a
row	 on	 my	 bed	 as	 my	 flesh
flapped	 to	 either	 side.	 She
was	 sewing	 her	 initials	 into
each	 of	 them,	 then	 tossing
them	 back	 into	 me,	 along
with	 a	 passel	 of	 forgottenobjects:	 an	 orange	 Day-Glo
rubber	 ball	 I	 got	 from	 a
gumball	machine	when	I	was
ten;	 a	 pair	 of	 violet	 wool
stockings	 I	 wore	 when	 I	 was
twelve;	 a	 cheap	 gold-tinted
ring	a	boy	bought	me	when	I
was	 a	 freshman.	 With	 each
object,	 relief	 that	 it	 was	 no
longer	lost.
	
When	I	woke,	it	was	past
noon,	 and	 I	 was	 disoriented
and	afraid.	I	took	a	gulp	frommy	flask	of	vodka	to	ease	the
panic,	 then	 ran	 to	 the
bathroom	 and	 threw	 it	 up,
along	 with	 strings	 of	 sugary
brown	 saliva	 from	 the
amaretto	sours.
Stripped	 naked	 and	 into
the	 bathtub,	 the	 porcelain
cool	 on	 my	 back.	 I	 lay	 flat,
turned	on	the	water,	and	let	it
creep	up	over	me,	fill	my	ears
until	they	submerged	with	the
satisfying	whulp!	of	a	sinking
ship	 going	 under.	 Would	 Iever	have	the	discipline	to	let
the	 water	 cover	 my	 face,
drown	 with	 my	 eyes	 open?
Just	refuse	to	lift	yourself	two
inches,	and	it	will	be	done.
The	 water	 stung	 at	 my
eyes,	 covered	 my	 nose,	 and
then	enveloped	me.	I	pictured
myself	 from	 above:	 lashed
skin	and	a	still	face	flickering
under	 a	 film	 of	 water.	 My
body	 refused	 the	 quiet.
Bodice,	 dirty,	 nag,	 widow!	 it
screamed.	 My	 stomach	 andthroat	 were	 convulsing,
desperate	 to	 pull	 in	 air.
Finger,	whore,	hollow!	A	few
moments	 of	 discipline.	 What
a	 pure	 way	 to	 die.	 Blossom,
bloom,	bonny.
I	 jerked	 to	 the	 surface,
gulped	 in	 air.	 Panting,	 my
head	tilted	toward	the	ceiling.
Easy,	 easy,	 I	 told	 myself.
Easy,	 sweet	 girl,	 you’ll	 be
okay.	 I	 petted	 my	 cheek,
baby-talked	
myself—how
pitiful—but	 my	 breathinghushed.
Then,	 a	 bolt	 of	 panic.	 I
reached	behind	me	to	find	the
circle	of	skin	in	my	back.	Still
smooth.
	
Black	 clouds	 were	 sitting
low	over	the	town,	so	the	sun
curled	 around	 the	 edges	 and
turned	 everything	 a	 sickly
yellow,	 as	 if	 we	 were	 bugs
under	fluorescents.	Still	weak
from	 the	 encounter	 with	 my
mother,	 the	 feeble	 glowseemed	 appropriate.	 I	 had	 an
appointment	 at	 Meredith
Wheeler’s	 for	 an	 interview
concerning	 the	 Keenes.	 Not
sure	 it	 would	 yield	 much	 of
import	 but	 I’d	 at	 least	 get	 a
quote,	which	I	needed,	having
not	 heard	 a	 word	 from	 the
Keenes	 after	 my	 last	 article.
Truth	 was,	 with	 John	 living
behind	 Meredith’s	 house
now,	 I	 had	 no	 way	 of
reaching	 him	 except	 through
her.	I’m	sure	she	loved	that.I	 hiked	 over	 to	 Main
Street	 to	 pick	 up	 my	 car
where	 I’d	 abandoned	 it
during	 yesterday’s	 outing
with	
Richard.	
Weakly
dropped	into	the	driver’s	seat.
I	 still	 managed	 to	 arrive	 at
Meredith’s	 a	 half	 hour	 early.
Knowing	 the	 primping	 and
plumping	 going	 on	 in
preparation	 for	 my	 visit,	 I
assumed	 she’d	 set	 me	 out
back	 on	 the	 patio,	 and	 I’d
have	a	chance	to	check	in	onJohn.	 As	 it	 turned	 out,	 she
wasn’t	there	at	all,	but	I	could
hear	 music	 from	 behind	 the
house,	and	I	followed	it	to	see
the	 Four	 Little	 Blondes	 in
fluorescent	bikinis	at	one	end
of	 the	 pool,	 passing	 a	 joint
between	 them,	 and	 John
sitting	 in	 the	 shade	 at	 the
other	 end,	 watching.	 Amma
looked	 tan	 and	 blonde	 and
delicious,	 not	 a	 trace	 of
yesterday’s	 hangover	 on	 her.
She	 was	 as	 tiny	 and	 colorfulas	an	appetizer.
Confronted	 with	 all	 that
smooth	flesh,	I	could	feel	my
skin	 begin	 its	 chattering.	 I
couldn’t	handle	direct	contact
on	top	of	my	hangover	panic.
So	 I	 spied	 from	 the	 edge	 of
the	house.	Anyone	could	have
seen	 me,	 but	 none	 bothered.
Amma’s	 three	 friends	 were
soon	 in	 a	 marijuana-and-heat
spiral,	 splayed	 face	 down	 on
their	blankets.
Amma	 stayed	 up,	 staringdown	 John,	 rubbing	 suntan
oil	 on	 her	 shoulders,	 her
chest,	 breasts,	 slipping	 her
hands	 under	 her	 bikini	 top,
watching	 John	 watching	 her.
John	 gave	 no	 reaction,	 like	 a
kid	 on	 his	 sixth	 hour	 of	 TV.
The	more	lasciviously	Amma
rubbed,	 the	 less	 flicker	 he
gave.	 One	 triangle	 of	 her	 top
had	fallen	askew	to	reveal	the
plump	
breast	
beneath.
Thirteen	 years	 old,	 I	 thought
to	myself,	but	I	felt	a	spear	ofadmiration	for	the	girl.	When
I’d	 been	 sad,	 I	 hurt	 myself.
Amma	 hurt	 other	 people.
When	 I’d	 wanted	 attention,
I’d	submitted	myself	to	boys:
Do	 what	 you	 want;	 just	 like
me.	Amma’s	sexual	offerings
seemed	a	form	of	aggression.
Long	 skinny	 legs	 and	 slim
wrists	and	high,	babied	voice,
all	aimed	like	a	gun.	Do	what
I	want;	I	might	like	you.
“Hey	 John,	 who	 do	 I
remind	 you	 of?”	 Ammacalled.
“A	 little	 girl	 who’s
misbehaving	 and	 thinks	 it’s
cuter	 than	 it	 is,”	 John	 called
back.	 He	 sat	 at	 the	 pool’s
edge	 in	 shorts	 and	 a	 T-shirt,
his	feet	dipped	into	the	water.
His	 legs	 had	 a	 thin,	 almost
feminine	coating	of	dark	hair.
“Really?	 Why	 don’t	 you
stop	 watching	 me	 from	 your
little	 hideaway	 then,”	 she
said,	 pointing	 a	 leg	 toward
the	 carriage	 house,	 with	 itstiny	 attic	 window	 sporting
blue	
checked	
curtains.
“Meredith	will	be	jealous.”
“I	 like	 to	 keep	 an	 eye	 on
you,	 Amma.	 Always	 know	 I
have	my	eye	on	you.”
My	 guess:	 My	 half	 sister
had	 gone	 into	 his	 room
without	 permission,	 rifled
through	his	things.	Or	waited
for	him	on	his	bed.
“You	 sure	 do	 now,”	 she
said,	 laughing,	 her	 legs
spread	 wide.	 She	 lookedgruesome	 in	 the	 dark	 light,
the	 rays	 casting	 pockets	 of
shadows	on	her	face.
“It’ll	 be	 your	 turn	 some
day,	 Amma,”	 he	 said.
“Soon.”
“Big	man.	I	hear,”	Amma
called	back.	Kylie	looked	up,
focused	 her	 eyes	 on	 her
friend,	 smiled,	 and	 lay	 back
down.
“Patient,	too.”
“You’ll	 need	 it.”	 She
blew	him	a	kiss.The	 amaretto	 sours	 were
turning	on	me,	and	I	was	sick
of	 this	 banter.	 I	 didn’t	 like
John	 Keene	 flirting	 with
Amma,	 no	 matter	 how
provocative	 she	 was	 being.
She	was	still	thirteen.
“Hello?”	 I	 called	 out,
rousing	Amma,	who	waggled
her	fingers	at	me.	Two	of	the
three	blondes	looked	up,	then
lay	 back	 down.	 John	 cupped
some	pool	water	in	his	hands
and	 rubbed	 it	 across	 his	 facebefore	 turning	 the	 corners	 of
his	 mouth	 up	 at	 me.	 He	 was
tracing	back	the	conversation,
guessing	how	much	I’d	heard.
I	 was	 equidistant	 from	 each
side,	 and	 walked	 toward
John,	 sat	 a	 good	 six	 feet
away.
“You	 read	 the	 story?”	 I
asked.	He	nodded.
“Yeah,	 thanks,	 it	 was
nice.	The	part	about	Natalie	at
least.”
“I’m	 here	 to	 talk	 a	 littlebit	 to	 Meredith	 today	 about
Wind	 Gap;	 maybe	 Natalie
will	come	up,”	I	said.	“Is	that
okay	by	you?”
He	
shrugged	
his
shoulders.
“Sure.	 She’s	 not	 home
yet.	Not	enough	sugar	for	the
sweet	 tea.	 She	 freaked,	 ran
off	 to	 the	 store	 without
makeup.”
“Scandalous.”
“For	Meredith,	yes.”
“How	 are	 things	 goinghere?”
“Oh,	 all	 right,”	 he	 said.
He	 began	 patting	 his	 right
hand.	 Self-comfort.	 I	 felt
sorry	 for	 him	 again.	 “I	 don’t
know	that	anything	would	be
any	 good	 anywhere,	 so	 it’s
hard	 to	 gauge	 if	 this	 is	 better
or	 worse,	 you	 know	 what	 I
mean?”
“Like:	 This	 place	 is
miserable	 and	 I	 want	 to	 die,
but	I	can’t	think	of	any	place
I’d	 rather	 be,”	 I	 offered.	 Heturned	 and	 stared	 at	 me,	 blue
eyes	mirroring	the	oval	pool.
“That’s	 exactly	 what	 I
mean.”	 Get	 used	 to	 it,	 I
thought.
“Have	 you	 thought	 about
getting	 some	 counseling,
seeing	a	therapist?”	I	said.	“It
might	be	really	helpful.”
“Yeah,	 John,	 might	 quell
some	of	your	urges.	They	can
be	 deadly,	 you	 know?	 We
don’t	 want	 more	 little	 girls
showing	 up	 without	 theirteeth.”	 Amma	 had	 slipped
into	the	pool	and	was	floating
ten	feet	away.
John	 shot	 up,	 and	 for	 a
second	 I	 thought	 he	 was
going	 to	 dive	 into	 the	 pool
and	 throttle	 her.	 Instead,	 he
pointed	 a	 finger	 at	 her,
opened	 his	 mouth,	 closed	 it,
and	walked	to	his	attic	room.
“That	 was	 really	 cruel,”	 I
said	to	her.
“But	 funny,”	 said	 Kylie,
floating	 by	 on	 a	 hot	 pink	 airmattress.
“What	 a	 freak,”	 added
Kelsey,	paddling	past.
Jodes	 was	 sitting	 in	 her
blanket,	 knees	 pulled	 to	 her
chin,	 eyes	 trained	 on	 the
carriage	house.
“You	 were	 so	 sweet	 with
me	 the	 other	 night.	 Now
you’re	 so	 changed,”	 I
murmured	to	Amma.	“Why?”
She	 looked	 caught	 off
guard	 for	 a	 split	 second.	 “I
don’t	know.	I	wish	I	could	fixit.	 I	 do.”	 She	 swam	 off
toward	 her	 friends	 as
Meredith	appeared	at	the	door
and	peevishly	called	me	in.
	
The	 Wheelers’	 home
looked	
familiar:	
an
overstuffed	 plush	 sofa,	 a
coffee	table	hosting	a	sailboat
replica,	 a	 jaunty	 velvet
ottoman	 in	 lime	 green,	 a
black-and-white	 photo	 of	 the
Eiffel	Tower	taken	at	a	severe
angle.	 Pottery	 Barn,	 springcatalog.	 Right	 down	 to	 the
lemon	yellow	plates	Meredith
was	now	placing	on	the	table,
glazed	 berry	 tarts	 sitting	 in
the	center.
She	 was	 wearing	 a	 linen
sundress	 the	 color	 of	 an
unripe	 peach,	 her	 hair	 pulled
down	 over	 her	 ears	 and	 held
at	 the	 nape	 of	 her	 neck	 in	 a
loose	 ponytail	 that	 had	 to
have	taken	twenty	minutes	to
get	 that	 perfect.	 She	 looked,
suddenly,	 a	 lot	 like	 mymother.	 She	 could	 have	 been
Adora’s	
child	
more
believably	than	I.	I	could	feel
a	 grudge	 coming,	 tried	 to
keep	 it	 in	 check,	 as	 she
poured	 us	 each	 a	 glass	 of
sweet	tea	and	smiled.
“I	 have	 no	 idea	 what	 my
sister	was	saying	to	you,	but	I
can	 only	 guess	 it	 was	 hateful
or	 dirty,	 so	 I	 apologize,”	 she
said.	“Although,	I’m	sure	you
know	 Amma’s	 the	 real
ringleader	 there.”	 She	 lookedat	 the	 tart	 but	 seemed
disinclined	 to	 eat	 it.	 Too
pretty.
“You	 probably	 know
Amma	 better	 than	 I	 do,”	 I
said.	 “She	 and	 John	 don’t
seem	to...”
“She’s	 a	 very	 needy
child,”	 she	 said,	 crossing	 her
legs,	
uncrossing	
them,
straightening	 her	 dress.
“Amma	worries	she’ll	shrivel
up	and	blow	away	if	attention
isn’t	 always	 on	 her.Especially	from	boys.”
“Why	 doesn’t	 she	 like
John?	 She	 was	 implying	 he
was	 the	 one	 who	 hurt
Natalie.”	 I	 took	 out	 my	 tape
recorder	 and	 pressed	 the	 On
button,	partly	because	I	didn’t
want	 to	 waste	 time	 with	 ego
games,	 and	 partly	 because	 I
hoped	 she’d	 say	 something
about	 John	 worth	 printing.	 If
he	 was	 the	 prime	 suspect,	 at
least	 in	 Wind	 Gap	 minds,	 I
needed	comment.“That’s	 just	 Amma.	 She
has	a	mean	streak.	John	likes
me	and	not	her,	so	she	attacks
him.	When	she’s	not	trying	to
steal	him	away	from	me.	Like
that’s	going	to	happen.”
“It	 seems	 a	 lot	 of	 people
have	 been	 talking,	 though,
saying	 they	 think	 John	 may
have	 something	 to	 do	 with
this.	 Why	 do	 you	 think	 that
is?”
She	 shrugged,	 stuck	 her
lower	 lip	 out,	 watched	 thetape	whir	a	few	seconds.
“You	 know	 how	 it	 is.
He’s	 from	 out	 of	 town.	 He’s
smart	 and	 worldly	 and	 eight
times	 better	 looking	 than
anyone	 else	 around	 here.
People	 would	 like	 it	 to	 be
him,	because	then	that	means
this...evilness	 didn’t	 come
from	Wind	Gap.	It	came	from
outside.	Eat	your	tart.”
“Do	 you	 believe	 he’s
innocent?”	 I	 took	 a	 bite,	 the
glaze	dripping	off	my	lip.“Of	 course	 I	 do.	 It’s	 all
idle	 gossip.	 Just	 because
someone	 goes	 for	 a	 drive...
lots	 of	 people	 do	 that	 around
here.	 John	 just	 had	 bad
timing.”
“And	 what	 about	 the
family?	What	can	you	tell	me
about	either	of	the	girls?”
“They	 were	 darling	 girls,
very	 well	 behaved	 and	 sweet
little	 things.	 It’s	 like	 God
plucked	 the	 best	 girls	 from
Wind	 Gap	 to	 take	 to	 heavenfor	 his	 own.”	 She’d	 been
practicing,	 the	 words	 had	 a
rehearsed	 rhythm.	 Even	 her
smile	 seemed	 measured:	 Too
small	 is	 stingy,	 too	 big	 is
inappropriately	 pleased.	 This
smile	 just	 right.	 Brave	 and
hopeful,	it	said.
“Meredith,	 I	 know	 that’s
not	 what	 you	 thought	 about
the	girls.”
“Well,	what	kind	of	quote
do	you	want?”	she	snapped.
“A	truthful	one.”“I	 can’t	 do	 that.	 John
would	hate	me.”
“I	wouldn’t	have	to	name
you	in	the	article.”
“Then	 what	 would	 be	 the
point	 of	 me	 doing	 the
interview?”
“If	 you	 know	 something
about	 the	 girls	 that	 people
aren’t	 saying,	 you	 should	 tell
me.	 It	 could	 direct	 attention
away	 from	 John,	 depending
on	what	the	information	is.”
Meredith	 took	 a	 demuresip	 of	 tea,	 dabbed	 at	 the
corner	 of	 her	 strawberry	 lips
with	her	napkin.
“But	 could	 I	 still	 get	 my
name	
in	
the	
article
somewhere?”
“I	 can	 quote	 you
elsewhere	by	name.”
“I	 want	 the	 stuff	 about
God	 plucking	 them	 to
heaven,”	 Meredith	 baby-
talked.	 She	 wrung	 her	 hands
and	smiled	at	me	sideways.
“No.	Not	that.	I’ll	use	thequote	 about	 John	 being	 from
out	 of	 town	 and	 that’s	 why
people	 are	 so	 gossipy	 about
him.”
“Why	 can’t	 you	 use	 the
one	 I	 want?”	 I	 could	 see
Meredith	 as	 a	 five-year-old,
dressed	 as	 a	 princess	 and
bitching	 because	 her	 favorite
doll	didn’t	like	her	imaginary
tea.
“Because	it	goes	against	a
lot	 of	 things	 I’ve	 heard,	 and
because	 no	 one	 really	 talksthat	way.	It	sounds	fake.”
It	 was	 the	 most	 pathetic
showdown	I’ve	ever	had	with
a	 subject,	 and	 a	 completely
unethical	way	to	do	my	work.
But	 I	 wanted	 her	 fucking
story.	 Meredith	 twirled	 the
silver	 chain	 around	 her	 neck,
studied	me.
“You	 could	 have	 been	 a
model,	 you	 know?”	 she	 said
suddenly.
“I	 doubt	 that,”	 I	 snapped.
Every	time	people	said	I	waspretty,	I	thought	of	everything
ugly	 swarming	 beneath	 my
clothes.
“You	 could	 have.	 I
always	 wanted	 to	 be	 you
when	I	grew	up.	I	think	about
you,	 you	 know?	 I	 mean,	 our
moms	are	friends	and	all,	so	I
knew	 you	 were	 in	 Chicago
and	I	pictured	you	in	this	big
mansion	 with	 a	 few	 little
curly	 tops	 and	 some	 stud
husband	 investment	 banker.
You	 all	 in	 the	 kitchendrinking	orange	juice	and	him
getting	in	his	Jag	and	going	to
work.	But	I	guess	I	imagined
wrong.”
“You	 did.	 Sounds	 nice,
though.”	 I	 took	 another	 bite
of	 tart.	 “So	 tell	 me	 about	 the
girls.”
“All	 business,	 huh?	 You
never	 were	 the	 friendliest.	 I
know	 about	 your	 sister.	 That
you	had	a	sister	who	died.”
“Meredith,	 we	 can	 talk
some	time.	I’d	like	that.	Afterthis.	 But	 let’s	 get	 this	 story,
and	then	maybe	we	can	enjoy
ourselves.”	I	didn’t	intend	on
staying	 more	 than	 a	 minute
after	the	interview	wrapped.
“Okay...So,	 here	 it	 is.	 I
think	 I	 know	 why...the
teeth...”	 she	 pantomimed
extraction.
“Why?”
“I	 can’t	 believe	 everyone
refuses	to	acknowledge	this,”
she	said.
Meredith	 glanced	 aroundthe	room.
“You	 didn’t	 hear	 this
from	 me,	 okay?”	 she
continued.	 “The	 girls,	 Ann
and	 Natalie,	 they	 were
biters.”
“What	 do	 you	 mean,
biters?”
“Both	 of	 them.	 They	 had
serious	 tempers.	 Like	 scary-
time	 tempers.	 Like	 boy
tempers.	 But	 they	 didn’t	 hit.
They	bit.	Look.”
She	 held	 out	 her	 righthand.	 Just	 below	 the	 thumb
were	 three	 white	 scars	 that
shone	in	the	afternoon	light.
“That’s	from	Natalie.	And
this.”	 She	 pulled	 back	 her
hair	 to	 reveal	 a	 left	 ear	 with
only	 half	 an	 earlobe.	 “My
hand	 she	 bit	 when	 I	 was
painting	 her	 fingernails.	 She
decided	 halfway	 through	 that
she	 didn’t	 like	 it,	 but	 I	 told
her	to	let	me	finish,	and	when
I	 held	 her	 hand	 down,	 she
sunk	her	teeth	into	me.”“And	the	earlobe?”
“I	 stayed	 over	 there	 one
night	 when	 my	 car	 wouldn’t
start.	I	was	asleep	in	the	guest
room	 and	 the	 next	 thing	 I
knew,	 blood	 all	 over	 the
sheets	 and	 my	 ear	 just	 felt
like	 it	 was	 on	 fire,	 like	 I
wanted	 to	 run	 away	 from	 it
but	 it	 was	 attached	 to	 my
head.	 And	 Natalie	 was
screaming	 like	 she	 was	 on
fire.	 That	 screaming	 was
scarier	 than	 the	 biting.	 Mr.Keene	 had	 to	 hold	 her	 down.
The	kid	had	serious	problems.
We	 looked	 for	 my	 earlobe,
see	 if	 it	 could	 be	 stitched
back	 on,	 but	 it	 was	 gone.	 I
guess	 she	 swallowed	 it.”	 She
gave	 a	 laugh	 that	 sounded
like	 the	 reverse	 of	 a	 gulp	 of
air.	 “I	 mostly	 just	 felt	 sorry
for	her.”
Lie.
“Ann,	 was	 she	 as	 bad?”	 I
asked.
“Worse.	There	are	peopleall	 over	 this	 town	 with	 her
teeth	 marks	 in	 them.	 Your
mother	included.”
“What?”	My	hands	began
to	 sweat	 and	 the	 back	 of	 my
neck	went	cold.
“Your	 mom	 was	 tutoring
her	 and	 Ann	 didn’t
understand.	 She	 completely
lost	 it,	 pulled	 some	 of	 your
momma’s	 hair	 out,	 and	 bit
into	 her	 wrist.	 Hard.	 I	 think
there	 had	 to	 be	 stitches.”
Images	 of	 my	 mother’s	 thinarm	 caught	 between	 tiny
teeth,	 Ann	 shaking	 her	 head
like	 a	 dog,	 blood	 blossoming
on	 my	 mother’s	 sleeve,	 on
Ann’s	 lips.	 A	 scream,	 a
release.
A	 little	 circle	 of	 jagged
lines,	 and	 within,	 a	 ring	 of
perfect	skin.	
Chapter	Eleven
Phone	 calls	 back	 in	 my
room,	no	sign	of	my	mother.	I
could	 hear	 Alan	 downstairs,
snapping	at	Gayla	for	cutting
the	filets	wrong.
“I	 know	 it	 seems	 trivial,
Gayla,	but	think	of	it	like	this:
Trivial	 details	 are	 the
difference	 between	 a	 good
meal	
and	
a	
dining
experience.”	Gayla	emitted	anassenting	 sound.	 Even	 her
mm-hhmms	have	a	twang.
I	 phoned	 Richard	 on	 his
cell,	one	of	the	few	people	in
Wind	 Gap	 to	 own	 one,
though	 I	 shouldn’t	 snipe,
since	 I’m	 one	 of	 the	 only
holdouts	 in	 Chicago.	 I	 just
never	 want	 to	 be	 that
reachable.
“Detective	 Willis.”	 I
could	 hear	 a	 loudspeaker
calling	 a	 name	 in	 the
background.“You	 busy,	 Detective?”	 I
blushed.	 Levity	 felt	 like
flirting	felt	like	foolishness.
“Hi	 there,”	 came	 his
formal	 voice.	 “I’m	 wrapping
things	 up	 here;	 can	 I	 give	 a
call	back?”
“Sure,	I’m	at...”
“The	number	shows	up	on
my	display.”
“Fancy.”
“Very	true.”
	
Twenty	 minutes	 later:“Sorry,	 I	 was	 at	 the	 hospital
in	Woodberry	with	Vickery.”
“A	lead?”
“Of	sorts.”
“A	comment?”
“I	 had	 a	 very	 nice	 time
last	night.”
I’d	 written	 Richard	 cop
Richard	 cop	 twelve	 times
down	 my	 leg,	 and	 had	 to
make	 myself	 stop	 because	 I
was	itching	for	a	razor.
“Me,	too.	Look,	I	need	to
ask	 you	 something	 straightand	I	need	you	to	tell	me.	Off
record.	 Then	 I	 need	 a
comment	 I	 can	 print	 for	 my
next	piece.”
“Okay,	 I’ll	 try	 to	 help
you,	 Camille.	 What	 do	 you
need	to	ask	me?”
“Can	 we	 meet	 at	 that
cheesy	 bar	 we	 first	 had	 a
drink	 at?	 I	 need	 to	 do	 this	 in
person,	 and	 I	 need	 to	 get	 out
of	the	house	and,	yes,	I’ll	say
it:	I	need	a	drink.”
	Three	guys	from	my	class
were	 at	 Sensors	 when	 I	 got
there,	nice	guys,	one	of	whom
had	 famously	 won	 a	 State
Fair	 blue	 ribbon	 for	 his
obscenely	 big,	 milk-dripping
sow	 one	 year.	 A	 folksy
stereotype	 Richard	 would
have	 loved.	 We	 exchanged
niceties—they	bought	me	my
first	
two	
rounds—and
photographs	 of	 their	 kids,
eight	 in	 all.	 One	 of	 them,
Jason	Turnbough,	was	still	asblond	 and	 round-faced	 as	 a
kid.	 Tongue	 just	 peeking	 out
the	corner	of	his	mouth,	pink
cheeks,	 round	 blue	 eyes
darting	 between	 my	 face	 and
my	 breasts	 for	 most	 of	 the
conversation.	 He	 stopped
once	 I	 pulled	 out	 my	 tape
recorder	 and	 asked	 about	 the
murders.	 Then	 it	 was	 those
whirling	 wheels	 that	 had	 his
full	attention.	People	got	such
a	 charge	 from	 seeing	 their
names	 in	 print.	 Proof	 ofexistence.	 I	 could	 picture	 a
squabble	 of	 ghosts	 ripping
through	 piles	 of	 newspapers.
Pointing	 at	 a	 name	 on	 the
page.	 See,	 there	 I	 am.	 I	 told
you	I	lived.	I	told	you	I	was.
“Who’d	 have	 thought
when	 we	 were	 kids	 back	 in
school,	 we’d	 be	 sitting	 here
talking	 about	 murders	 in
Wind	
Gap?”	
marveled
Tommy	 Ringer,	 now	 grown
into	a	dark-haired	fellow	with
a	rangy	beard.“I	know,	I	mean	I	work	in
a	
supermarket,	
for
Chrissakes,”	 said	 Ron	 Laird,
a	 kindly,	 mouse-faced	 guy
with	 a	 booming	 voice.	 The
three	 glowed	 with	 misplaced
civic	pride.	Infamy	had	come
to	Wind	Gap,	and	they’d	take
it.	 They	 could	 keep	 working
at	 the	 supermarket,	 the
drugstore,	the	hatchery.	When
they	 died,	 this—along	 with
getting	 married	 and	 having
kids—would	 be	 on	 their	 listof	things	they’d	done.	And	it
was	 something	 that	 merely
happened	 to	 them.	 No,	 more
accurately,	 it	 was	 something
that	happened	in	their	town.	I
wasn’t	 entirely	 sure	 about
Meredith’s	assessment.	Some
people	would	love	to	have	the
killer	 be	 a	 guy	 born	 and
raised	in	Wind	Gap.	Someone
they	 went	 fishing	 with	 once,
someone	 they	 were	 in	 Cub
Scouts	 with.	 Makes	 a	 better
story.Richard	 flung	 open	 the
door,	 which	 was	 surprisingly
light	 for	 its	 looks.	 Any
customer	 who	 wasn’t	 a
regular	 used	 too	 much	 force,
so	every	few	minutes	the	door
banged	 into	 the	 side	 of	 the
building.	 It	 offered	 an
interesting	 punctuation	 to
conversation.
As	he	walked	in,	pitching
his	 jacket	 over	 his	 shoulder,
the	three	men	groaned.
“This	guy.”“I’m	
so	
fucking
impressed,	dude.”
“Save	some	brain	cells	for
the	 case,	 buddy.	 You	 need
’em.”
I	 hopped	 off	 the	 stool,
licked	my	lips,	and	smiled.
“Well	 fellows,	 got	 to	 go
to	 work.	 Interview	 time.
Thanks	for	the	drinks.”
“We’ll	be	over	here	when
you	 get	 bored,”	 Jason	 called
out.	 Richard	 just	 smiled	 at
him,	 muttering	 idiot	 throughhis	teeth.
I	 slugged	 back	 my	 third
bourbon,	grabbed	the	waitress
to	set	us	up,	and	once	we	had
our	 drinks	 in	 front	 of	 us,	 I
rested	 my	 chin	 on	 my	 hands
and	 wondered	 if	 I	 really
wanted	 to	 talk	 business.	 He
had	a	scar	just	above	his	right
eyebrow	and	a	tiny	dimple	in
his	 chin.	 He	 tapped	 his	 foot
on	 top	 of	 mine	 twice,	 where
no	one	could	see.
“So	what	gives,	Scoop?”“Look,	 I	 need	 to	 know
something.	 I	 really	 need	 to
know	 it,	 and	 if	 you	 can’t	 tell
me,	 then	 you	 can’t	 tell	 me,
but	 please	 think	 hard.”	 He
nodded.
“When	 you	 think	 of	 the
person	who	did	these	killings,
do	you	have	a	specific	person
in	your	mind?”	I	asked.
“I	have	a	few.”
“Male	or	female?”
“Why	 are	 you	 asking	 me
this	 with	 such	 urgency	 rightnow,	Camille?”
“I	just	need	to	know.”
He	 paused,	 sipped	 his
drink,	 rubbed	 his	 hand	 over
stubble	on	his	chin.
“I	don’t	believe	a	woman
would	 have	 done	 these	 girls
this	way.”	He	tapped	my	foot
again.	 “Hey,	 what’s	 going
on?	 You	 tell	 me	 the	 truth
now.”
“I	 don’t	 know,	 I’m	 just
freaking	 out.	 I	 just	 needed	 to
know	 where	 to	 point	 myenergies.”
“Let	me	help.”
“Did	 you	 know	 the	 girls
were	 known	 for	 biting
people?”
“I	 understood	 from	 the
school	 there	 had	 been	 an
incident	 involving	 Ann
hurting	a	neighbor’s	bird,”	he
said.	“Natalie	was	on	a	pretty
tight	 leash,	 though,	 because
of	 what	 happened	 at	 her	 last
school.”
“Natalie	 bit	 the	 earlobeoff	of	someone	she	knew.”
“No.	 I	 have	 no	 incident
reports	 filed	 against	 Natalie
since	she	came	here.”
“Then	 they	 didn’t	 report
it.	 I	 saw	 the	 ear,	 Richard,
there	 was	 no	 lobe,	 and	 there
was	no	reason	for	this	person
to	 lie.	 And	 Ann	 attacked
someone,	 too.	 Bit	 someone.
But	I	wonder	more	and	more
if	 these	 girls	 got	 tangled	 up
with	 the	 wrong	 person.	 It’s
like	they	were	put	down.	Likea	 bad	 animal.	 Maybe	 that’s
why	their	teeth	were	taken.”
“Let’s	begin	slowly.	First,
who	 did	 each	 of	 the	 girls
bite?”
“I	can’t	say.”
“Goddam	it,	Camille,	I’m
not	fucking	around.	Tell	me.”
“No.”	 I	 was	 surprised	 at
his	anger.	I’d	expected	him	to
laugh	and	tell	me	I	was	pretty
when	defiant.
“This	is	a	fucking	murder
case,	 okay?	 If	 you	 haveinformation,	I	need	it.”
“So	do	your	job.”
“I’m	 trying,	 Camille,	 but
your	 screwing	 around	 with
me	doesn’t	help.”
“Now	 you	 know	 how	 it
feels,”	I	muttered	childishly.
“Fine.”	 He	 rubbed	 at	 his
eyes.	 “I’ve	 had	 a	 real	 long
day,	so...good	night.	I	hope	I
was	helpful	to	you.”	He	stood
up,	 nudged	 his	 half-full	 glass
over	to	me.
“I	 need	 an	 on-recordquote.”
“Later.	 I	 need	 to	 get	 a
little	 perspective.	 You	 may
have	 been	 right	 about	 us
being	 a	 horrible	 idea.”	 He
left,	and	the	guys	called	me	to
come	 back	 and	 join	 them.	 I
shook	 my	 head,	 finished	 my
drink,	 and	 pretended	 to	 take
notes	until	they	left.	All	I	did
was	 write	 sick	 place	 sick
place	 over	 and	 over	 for
twelve	pages.
	This	 time	 it	 was	 Alan
waiting	 for	 me	 when	 I	 got
home.	 He	 was	 sitting	 on	 the
Victorian	 love	 seat,	 white
brocade	 and	 black	 walnut,
dressed	in	white	slacks	and	a
silk	 shirt,	 dainty	 white	 silk
slippers	 on	 his	 feet.	 If	 he’d
been	 in	 a	 photograph,	 it
would	be	impossible	to	place
him	 in	 time—Victorian
gentleman,	Edwardian	dandy,
’50s	 fop?	 Twenty-first-
century	 househusband	 whonever	 worked,	 often	 drank,
and	 occasionally	 made	 love
to	my	mother.
Very	rarely	did	Alan	and	I
talk	 outside	 of	 my	 mother’s
presence.	As	a	child,	I’d	once
bumped	 into	 him	 in	 the
hallway,	 and	 he’d	 bent	 down
stiffly,	 to	 my	 eye	 level,	 and
said,	 “Hello,	 I	 hope	 you’re
well.”	 We’d	 been	 living	 in
the	same	house	for	more	than
five	 years,	 and	 that’s	 all	 he
could	 come	 up	 with.	 “Yes,thank	 you,”	 was	 all	 I	 could
give	in	return.
Now,	 though,	 Alan
seemed	 ready	 to	 take	 me	 on.
He	 didn’t	 say	 my	 name,	 just
patted	 the	 couch	 beside	 him.
On	 his	 knee	 he	 balanced	 a
cake	 plate	 with	 several	 large
silvery	sardines.	I	could	smell
them	from	the	entryway.
“Camille,”	 he	 said,
picking	 at	 a	 tail	 with	 a	 tiny
fish	 fork,	 “you’re	 making
your	 mother	 ill.	 I’m	 going	 tohave	 to	 ask	 you	 to	 leave	 if
conditions	don’t	improve.”
“How	 am	 I	 making	 her
ill?”
“By	 tormenting	 her.	 By
constantly	
bringing	
up
Marian.	 You	 can’t	 speculate
to	the	mother	of	a	dead	child
how	 that	 child’s	 body	 might
look	in	the	ground	right	now.
I	 don’t	 know	 if	 that’s
something	 you	 can	 feel
detached	 from,	 but	 Adora
can’t.”	A	glob	of	fish	tumbleddown	his	front,	leaving	a	row
of	 greasy	 stains	 the	 size	 of
buttons.
“You	 can’t	 talk	 to	 her
about	the	corpses	of	these	two
dead	little	girls,	or	how	much
blood	must	have	come	out	of
their	mouths	when	their	teeth
were	 pulled,	 or	 how	 long	 it
took	 for	 a	 person	 to	 strangle
them.”
“Alan,	I	never	said	any	of
those	 things	 to	 my	 mother.
Nothing	 even	 close.	 I	 trulyhave	 no	 idea	 what	 she’s
talking	 about.”	 I	 didn’t	 even
feel	indignant,	just	weary.
“Please,	 Camille,	 I	 know
how	
strained	
your
relationship	 is	 with	 your
mother.	 I	 know	 how	 jealous
you’ve	 always	 been	 of
anyone	else’s	well-being.	It’s
true,	you	know,	you	really	are
like	 Adora’s	 mother.	 She’d
stand	 guard	 over	 this	 house
like	a...witch,	old	and	angry.
Laughter	 offended	 her.	 Theonly	time	she	ever	smiled	was
when	 you	 refused	 to	 nurse
from	 Adora.	 Refused	 to	 take
the	nipple.”
That	 word	 on	 Alan’s	 oily
lips	 lit	 me	 up	 in	 ten	 different
places.	Suck,	bitch,	rubber	all
caught	fire.
“And	you	know	this	from
Adora,”	I	prompted.
He	 nodded,	 lips	 pursed
beatifically.
“Like	 you	 know	 that	 I
said	 horrible	 things	 aboutMarian	 and	 the	 dead	 girls
from	Adora.”
“Exactly,”	 he	 said,	 the
syllables	precisely	cut.
“Adora	 is	 a	 liar.	 If	 you
don’t	 know	 that,	 you’re	 an
idiot.”
“Adora’s	had	a	hard	life.”
I	forced	out	a	laugh.	Alan
was	 undaunted.	 “Her	 mother
used	to	come	into	her	room	in
the	 middle	 of	 the	 night	 and
pinch	 her	 when	 she	 was	 a
child,”	he	said,	eyeing	the	lastslab	of	sardine	pitifully.	“She
said	 it	 was	 because	 she	 was
worried	 Adora	 would	 die	 in
her	 sleep.	 I	 think	 it	 was
because	she	just	liked	to	hurt
her.”
A	 jangle	 of	 memory:
Marian	 down	 the	 hall	 in	 her
pulsing,	
machine-filled
invalid’s	 room.	 A	 sharp	 pain
on	 my	 arm.	 My	 mother
standing	 over	 me	 in	 her
cloudy	nightgown,	asking	if	I
was	 okay.	 Kissing	 the	 pinkcircle	 and	 telling	 me	 to	 go
back	to	sleep.
“I	 just	 think	 you	 should
know	 these	 things,”	 Alan
said.	 “Might	 make	 you	 be	 a
bit	kinder	to	your	mother.”
I	 had	 no	 plans	 for	 being
kinder	 to	 my	 mother.	 I	 just
wanted	 the	 conversation	 to
end.	“I’ll	try	to	leave	as	soon
as	I	can.”
“Be	 a	 good	 idea,	 if	 you
can’t	 make	 amends,”	 Alan
said.	 “But	 you	 might	 feelbetter	 about	 yourself	 if	 you
tried.	 Might	 help	 you	 heal.
Your	mind	at	least.”
Alan	 grabbed	 the	 last
floppy	 sardine	 and	 sucked	 it
into	his	mouth	whole.	I	could
picture	 the	 tiny	 bones
snapping	as	he	chewed.
	
A	 tumbler	 full	 of	 ice	 and
an	 entire	 bottle	 of	 bourbon
purloined	 from	 the	 back
kitchen,	 then	 up	 to	 my	 room
to	 drink.	 The	 booze	 hit	 mefast,	 probably	 because	 that
was	 how	 I	 was	 drinking	 it.
My	 ears	 were	 hot	 and	 my
skin	had	stopped	its	blinking.
I	 thought	 about	 that	 word	 at
the	back	of	my	neck.	Vanish.
Vanish	 will	 banish	 my	 woes,
I	thought	loopily.	Vanish	will
banish	 my	 troubles.	 Would
we	 have	 been	 this	 ugly	 if
Marian	 hadn’t	 died?	 Other
families	got	over	such	things.
Grieve	and	move	on.	She	still
hovered	 over	 us,	 a	 blondebaby	 girl	 maybe	 a	 hair	 too
cute	for	her	own	good,	maybe
just	 a	 bit	 too	 doted	 on.	 This
before	 she	 got	 sick,	 really
sick.	 She	 had	 an	 invisible
friend,	 a	 giant	 stuffed	 bear
she	called	Ben.	What	kind	of
kid	 has	 an	 imaginary	 friend
that’s	 a	 stuffed	 animal?	 She
collected	 hair	 ribbons	 and
arranged	them	in	alphabetical
order	by	color	name.	She	was
the	kind	of	girl	who	exploited
her	 cuteness	 with	 such	 joyyou	 couldn’t	 begrudge	 her.
Batting	 of	 the	 eyes,	 tossings
of	 the	 curls.	 She	 called	 my
mother	 Mudder	 and	 Alan...
hell,	 maybe	 she	 called	 Alan
Alan,	I	can’t	place	him	in	the
room	 in	 these	 memories.	 She
always	cleaned	her	plate,	kept
a	 remarkably	 tidy	 room,	 and
refused	 to	 wear	 anything	 but
dresses	 and	 Mary	 Janes.	 She
called	 me	 Mille	 and	 she
couldn’t	 keep	 her	 hands	 off
me.I	adored	her.
Drunk	but	still	drinking,	I
took	 a	 tumbler	 of	 liquor	 and
crept	 down	 the	 hallway	 to
Marian’s	 room.	 Amma’s
door,	 just	 one	 room	 down,
had	 been	 closed	 for	 hours.
What	 was	 it	 like	 growing	 up
next	 to	 the	 room	 of	 a	 dead
sister	 you	 never	 met?	 I	 felt	 a
pang	 of	 sorrow	 for	 Amma.
Alan	 and	 my	 mother	 were	 in
their	big	corner	bedroom,	but
the	 light	 was	 out	 and	 the	 fanwhirring.	 No	 such	 thing	 as
central	 air	 in	 these	 old
Victorians,	 and	 my	 mother
finds	room	units	tacky,	so	we
sweat	 the	 summers	 out.
Ninety	 degrees	 but	 the	 heat
made	 me	 feel	 safe,	 like
walking	underwater.
The	pillow	on	her	bed	still
had	a	small	indentation.	A	set
of	 clothes	 was	 laid	 out	 as	 if
covering	a	living	child.	Violet
dress,	 white	 tights,	 shiny
black	shoes.	Who’d	done	that—my	 mother?	 Amma?	 The
IV	 stand	 that	 had	 tailed
Marian	 so	 relentlessly	 in	 her
last	 year	 was	 standing,	 alert
and	 shiny,	 next	 to	 the	 rest	 of
the	 medical	 equipment:	 the
bed	 that	 was	 two	 feet	 taller
than	standard,	to	allow	patient
access;	the	heart	monitor;	the
bedpan.	 I	 was	 disgusted	 my
mother	 hadn’t	 purged	 this
stuff.	 It	 was	 a	 clinical	 and
utterly	
lifeless	
room.
Marian’s	 favorite	 doll	 hadbeen	 buried	 with	 her,	 a
massive	 rag	 doll	 with	 blonde
yarn	 curls	 to	 match	 my
sister’s.	 Evelyn.	 Or	 Eleanor?
The	 rest	 were	 lined	 against
the	 wall	 on	 a	 set	 of	 stands,
like	fans	in	bleachers.	Twenty
or	 so	 with	 white	 china	 faces
and	deep	glassy	eyes.
I	 could	 see	 her	 so	 easily
here,	 sitting	 cross-legged	 on
that	 bed,	 small	 and	 sweat
dotted,	 her	 eyes	 ringed	 with
purple.	 Shuffling	 cards	 orcombing	 her	 doll’s	 hair	 or
coloring	angrily.	I	could	hear
that	 sound:	 a	 crayon	 running
in	 hard	 lines	 across	 a	 paper.
Dark	 scribbles	 with	 the
crayon	 pushed	 so	 hard	 it
ripped	 the	 paper.	 She	 looked
up	 at	 me,	 breathing	 hard	 and
shallow.
“I’m	tired	of	dying.”
I	skitted	back	to	my	room
as	if	I	were	being	chased.
	
The	phone	rang	six	timesbefore	 Eileen	 picked	 up.
Things	the	Currys	don’t	have
in	their	home:	a	microwave,	a
VCR,	 a	 dishwasher,	 an
answering	machine.	Her	hello
was	 smooth	 but	 tense.	 Guess
they	 don’t	 get	 many	 calls
after	 eleven.	 She	 pretended
they	 hadn’t	 been	 asleep,	 that
they	 simply	 hadn’t	 heard	 the
phone,	but	it	took	another	two
minutes	 to	 get	 Curry	 on	 the
line.	 I	 pictured	 him,	 shining
his	 glasses	 on	 the	 corner	 ofpajamas,	 putting	 on	 old
leather	slippers,	looking	at	the
glowing	 face	 of	 an	 alarm
clock.	A	soothing	image.
Then	 I	 realized	 I	 was
remembering	 a	 commercial
for	 an	 all-night	 pharmacy	 in
Chicago.
It	 had	 been	 three	 days
since	I’d	last	talked	to	Curry.
Nearly	 two	 weeks	 since	 I’d
been	in	Wind	Gap.	Any	other
circumstance	 and	 he’d	 have
been	 phoning	 me	 three	 timesa	 day	 for	 updates.	 But	 he
couldn’t	bring	himself	to	ring
me	 at	 a	 civilian’s,	 at	 my
mother’s	house	no	less,	down
in	 Missouri,	 which	 in	 his
Windy	 City	 mind	 he	 equated
with	 the	 Deep	 South.	 Any
other	 circumstances	 and	 he’d
be	rumbling	into	the	phone	at
me	 for	 not	 staying	 in	 pocket,
but	not	tonight.
“Cubby,	 you	 okay?
What’s	the	story?”
“Well,	 I	 haven’t	 gottenthis	on	record,	but	I	will.	The
police	 definitely	 think	 the
killer	is	male,	definitely	from
Wind	 Gap,	 and	 they	 have	 no
DNA,	no	kill	site;	they	really
have	 very	 little.	 Either	 the
killer	 is	 a	 mastermind	 or	 an
accidental	 genius.	 The	 town
seems	 to	 be	 focusing	 on
Natalie	 Keene’s	 brother,
John.	 I	 have	 his	 girlfriend	 on
record	
protesting	
his
innocence.”
“Good,	 good	 stuff,	 but	 Ireally	 meant...I	 was	 asking
about	 you.	 You	 doing	 okay
down	there?	You	have	to	tell
me,	 because	 I	 can’t	 see	 your
face.	 Don’t	 do	 the	 stoic
thing.”
“I’m	 not	 so	 good,	 but
what	 does	 that	 matter?”	 My
voice	 came	 out	 higher	 and
more	 bitter	 than	 I’d	 planned.
“This	 is	 a	 good	 story,	 and	 I
think	 I’m	 on	 the	 edge	 of
something.	I	feel	like	another
few	 days,	 a	 week,	 and...Idon’t	know.	The	little	girls	bit
people.	 That’s	 what	 I	 got
today,	 and	 the	 cop	 I’ve	 been
working	 with,	 he	 didn’t	 even
know.”
“You	told	him	that?	What
was	his	comment?”
“Nothing.”
“Why	 the	 hell	 didn’t	 you
get	a	comment,	girl?”
See,	 Curry,	 Detective
Willis	felt	I	was	holding	back
some	 information	 and	 so	 he
sulked	 off,	 like	 all	 men	 dowhen	they	don’t	get	their	way
with	 women	 they’ve	 fooled
around	with.
“I	 screwed	 up.	 I’ll	 get	 it,
though.	 I	 need	 a	 few	 more
days	before	I	file,	Curry.	Get
a	little	more	local	color,	work
on	 this	 cop.	 I	 think	 they’re
almost	 convinced	 a	 little
press	would	help	juice	things.
Not	 that	 anyone	 reads	 our
paper	 down	 here.”	 Or	 up
there.
“They	 will.	 You’ll	 getsome	 serious	 notice	 for	 this,
Cubby.	 Your	 stuff	 is	 getting
close	 to	 good.	 Push	 harder.
Go	 talk	 to	 some	 of	 your	 old
friends.	 They	 might	 be	 more
open.	 Plus	 it’s	 good	 for	 the
piece—that	 Texas	 floods
series	 that	 won	 the	 Pulitzer
had	 a	 whole	 story	 on	 the
guy’s	 perspective	 about
coming	 home	 during	 a
tragedy.	 Great	 read.	 And	 a
friendly	 face,	 a	 few	 beers
might	 do	 you	 good.	 Soundslike	you’ve	already	had	a	few
tonight?”
“A	few.”
“Are	 you	 feeling...like
this	is	a	bad	situation	for	you?
With	the	recovery?”	I	heard	a
lighter	strike,	the	scratch	of	a
kitchen	chair	across	linoleum,
a	grunt	as	Curry	sat	down.
“Oh,	 it’s	 not	 for	 you	 to
worry	about.”
“Of	 course	 it	 is.	 Don’t
play	 martyr,	 Cubby.	 I’m	 not
going	 to	 penalize	 you	 if	 youneed	 to	 leave.	 You’ve	 got	 to
take	 care	 of	 yourself.	 I
thought	being	home	might	do
you	 good,	 but...I	 forget
sometimes	 parents	 aren’t
always...good	for	their	kids.”
“Whenever	 I’m	 here,”	 I
stopped,	 tried	 to	 pull	 it
together.	 “I	 just	 always	 feel
like	 I’m	 a	 bad	 person	 when
I’m	 here.”	 Then	 I	 started
crying,	 silent	 sobbing	 as
Curry	stammered	on	the	other
end.	 I	 could	 picture	 himpanicking,	 waving	 Eileen
over	 to	 handle	 this	 weeping
girl.	But	no.
“Ohhh,	 Camille,”	 he
whispered.	 “You	 are	 one	 of
the	 most	 decent	 people	 I
know.	 And	 there	 aren’t	 that
many	 decent	 people	 in	 this
world,	 you	 know?	 With	 my
folks	 gone,	 it’s	 basically	 you
and	Eileen.”
“I’m	 not	 decent.”	 The	 tip
of	 my	 pen	 was	 scribbling
deep,	scratchy	words	into	mythigh.	Wrong,	woman,	teeth.
“Camille,	 you	 are.	 I	 see
how	 you	 treat	 people,	 even
the	 most	 worthless	 pieces	 of
crap	I	can	think	of.	You	give
them	
some...dignity.
Understanding.	 Why	 do	 you
think	I	keep	you	around?	Not
because	 you’re	 a	 great
reporter.”	 Silence	 and	 thick
tears	 on	 my	 end.	 Wrong,
woman,	teeth.
“Was	 that	 funny	 at	 all?	 I
meant	it	to	be	funny.”“No.”
“My	 grandfather	 was	 in
vaudeville.	 But	 I	 guess	 that
gene	missed	me.”
“He	was?”
“Oh	yeah,	straight	off	the
boat	 from	 Ireland	 in	 New
York	City.	He	was	a	hilarious
guy,	
played	
four
instruments....”	
Another
spark	of	a	lighter.	I	pulled	the
thin	 covers	 up	 over	 me	 and
closed	 my	 eyes,	 listened	 to
Curry’s	story.	
Chapter	Twelve
Richard	 was	 living	 in
Wind	 Gap’s	 only	 apartment
building,	 an	 industrial	 box
built	 to	 house	 four	 tenants.
Only	 two	 apartments	 were
filled.	 The	 stumpy	 columns
holding	 up	 the	 carport	 had
been	 spray	 painted	 red,	 four
in	 a	 row,	 reading:	 “Stop	 the
Democrats,	
Stop	
the
Democrats,	
Stop	
theDemocrats,”	 then,	 randomly,
“I	like	Louie.”
Wednesday	morning.	The
storm	 still	 sitting	 in	 a	 cloud
above	 town.	 Hot	 and	 windy,
piss-yellow	light.	I	banged	on
his	 door	 with	 the	 corner	 of	 a
bourbon	 bottle.	 Bear	 gifts	 if
you	 can’t	 bear	 anything	 else.
I’d	 stopped	 wearing	 skirts.
Makes	my	legs	too	accessible
to	 someone	 prone	 to
touching.	If	he	was	anymore.
He	 opened	 the	 doorsmelling	 of	 sleep.	 Tousled
hair,	 boxers,	 a	 T-shirt	 inside
out.	 No	 smile.	 He	 kept	 the
place	 frigid.	 I	 could	 feel	 the
air	 from	 where	 I	 was
standing.
“You	want	to	come	in,	or
you	 want	 me	 to	 come	 out?”
he	asked,	scratching	his	chin.
Then	 he	 spotted	 the	 bottle.
“Ah,	 come	 in.	 I	 guess	 we’re
getting	drunk?”
The	 place	 was	 a	 mess,
which	 surprised	 me.	 Pantsstrewn	over	chairs,	a	garbage
can	 near	 overflowing,	 boxes
of	 papers	 piled	 up	 in
awkward	 spots	 in	 the
hallways,	 forcing	 you	 to	 turn
sideways	 to	 pass.	 He
motioned	 me	 to	 a	 cracked
leather	sofa	and	returned	with
a	tray	of	ice	and	two	glasses.
Poured	fat	portions.
“So,	 I	 shouldn’t	 have
been	 so	 rude	 last	 night,”	 he
said.
“Yeah.	I	mean,	I	feel	likeI’m	giving	you	a	fair	amount
of	 information,	 and	 you’re
not	giving	me	any.”
“I’m	 trying	 to	 solve	 a
murder.	 You’re	 trying	 to
report	about	that.	I	think	I	get
priority.	 There	 are	 certain
things,	 Camille,	 that	 I’m	 just
not	able	to	tell	you.”
“And	 vice	 versa—I	 have
a	 right	 to	 protect	 my
sources.”
“Which	in	turn	could	help
protect	the	person	doing	thesekillings.”
“You	 can	 figure	 it	 out,
Richard.	 I	 gave	 you	 almost
everything.	 Jeez,	 do	 a	 little
work	 on	 your	 own.”	 We
stared	at	each	other.
“I	love	it	when	you	get	all
tough	 reporter	 on	 me.”
Richard	 smiled.	 Shook	 his
head.	Poked	me	with	his	bare
foot.	“I	actually	really	kind	of
do.”
He	 poured	 us	 each
another	 glass.	 We’d	 besmashed	 before	 noon.	 He
pulled	 me	 to	 him,	 kissed	 me
on	 my	 lobe,	 stuck	 his	 tongue
in	my	ear.
“So	 Wind	 Gap	 girl,	 how
bad	 exactly	 were	 you?”	 he
whispered.	“Tell	me	about	the
first	time	you	did	it.”	The	first
time	was	the	second	time	was
the	 third	 was	 the	 fourth,
thanks	 to	 my	 eighth-grade
encounter.	 I	 decided	 to	 leave
it	at	the	first.
“I	 was	 sixteen,”	 I	 lied.Older	
seemed	
more
appropriate	 for	 the	 mood.	 “I
fucked	a	football	player	in	the
bathroom	at	this	party.”
My	 tolerance	 was	 better
than	 Richard’s,	 he	 was
already	 looking	 glazed,
twirling	 a	 finger	 around	 my
nipple,	hard	beneath	my	shirt.
“Mmmm...did	
you
come?”
I	 nodded.	 I	 remember
pretending	 to	 come.	 I
remember	 a	 murmur	 of	 anorgasm,	 but	 that	 wasn’t	 until
they’d	 passed	 me	 over	 to	 the
third	 guy.	 I	 remember
thinking	 it	 was	 sweet	 that	 he
kept	 panting	 in	 my	 ear,	 “Is
this	 all	 right?	 Is	 this	 all
right?”
“Do	 you	 want	 to	 come
now?	 With	 me?”	 Richard
whispered.
I	 nodded	 and	 he	 was	 on
me.	Those	hands	everywhere,
trying	to	go	up	my	shirt,	then
struggling	 to	 unbutton	 mypants,	tug	them	down.
“Hold	 on,	 hold	 on.	 My
way,”	 I	 whispered.	 “I	 like	 it
with	my	clothes	on.”
“No.	 I	 want	 to	 touch
you.”
“No,	baby,	my	way.”
I	 pulled	 my	 pants	 down
just	 a	 little	 bit,	 kept	 my
stomach	 covered	 with	 my
shirt,	kept	him	distracted	with
well-placed	 kisses.	 Then	 I
guided	 him	 into	 me	 and	 we
fucked,	 fully	 clothed,	 thecrack	 on	 the	 leather	 couch
scratching	 my	 ass.	 Trash,
pump,	 little,	 girl.	 It	 was	 the
first	time	I’d	been	with	a	man
in	 ten	 years.	 Trash,	 pump,
little,	 girl!	 His	 groaning	 was
soon	 louder	 than	 my	 skin.
Only	 then	 could	 I	 enjoy	 it.
Those	last	few	sweet	thrusts.
	
He	 lay	 half	 beside	 me,
half	on	top	of	me	and	panted
when	 it	 was	 done,	 still
holding	 the	 neck	 of	 my	 shirtin	 his	 fist.	 The	 day	 had	 gone
black.	 We	 were	 trembling	 on
the	edge	of	a	thunderstorm.
“Tell	 me	 who	 you	 think
did	 it,”	 I	 said.	 He	 looked
shocked.	Was	he	expecting	“I
love	 you”?	 He	 twirled	 my
hair	 for	 a	 minute,	 poked	 his
tongue	 in	 my	 ear.	 When
denied	 access	 to	 other	 body
parts,	men	become	fixated	on
the	 ear.	 Something	 I’d
learned	in	the	last	decade.	He
couldn’t	 touch	 my	 breasts	 ormy	 ass,	 my	 arms	 or	 my	 legs,
but	 Richard	 seemed	 content,
for	now,	with	my	ear.
“Between	 you	 and	 me,
it’s	John	Keene.	The	kid	was
very	 close	 to	 his	 sister.	 In	 an
unhealthy	 way.	 He	 has	 no
alibi.	 I	 think	 he’s	 got	 a	 thing
for	little	girls	that	he’s	trying
to	fight,	ends	up	killing	them
and	 pulling	 the	 teeth	 for	 a
thrill.	 He	 won’t	 be	 able	 to
hold	 out	 much	 longer,
though.	 This	 is	 going	 toaccelerate.	 We’re	 checking
for	 any	 weird	 behavior	 back
in	 Philly.	 Could	 be	 Natalie’s
problems	 weren’t	 the	 only
reason	they	moved.”
“I	 need	 something	 on
record.”
“Who	 told	 you	 about	 the
biting,	 and	 who	 did	 the	 girls
bite?”	he	whispered	hot	in	my
ear.	 Outside,	 the	 rain	 began
hitting	 the	 pavement	 like
someone	pissing.
“Meredith	 Wheeler	 toldme	 Natalie	 bit	 her	 earlobe
off.”
“What	else?”
“Ann	 bit	 my	 mother.	 On
her	wrist.	That’s	it.”
“See,	that	wasn’t	so	hard.
Good	 girl,”	 he	 whispered,
stroking	my	nipple	again.
“Now	 give	 me	 something
on	record.”
“No.”	 He	 smiled	 at	 me.
“My	way.”
	
Richard	 fucked	 meanother	 time	 that	 afternoon,
finally	 gave	 me	 a	 grudging
quote	 about	 a	 break	 in	 the
case,	 and	 an	 arrest	 likely.	 I
left	him	asleep	in	his	bed	and
ran	 through	 the	 rain	 to	 my
car.	 A	 random	 thought
clanged	 in	 my	 head:	 Amma
would	have	gotten	more	from
him.
I	 drove	 to	 Garrett	 Park
and	 sat	 in	 my	 car	 staring	 at
the	 rain,	 because	 I	 didn’t
want	 to	 go	 home.	 Tomorrowthis	spot	would	be	filled	with
kids	 beginning	 their	 long,
lazy	summer.	Now	it	was	just
me,	feeling	sticky	and	stupid.
I	 couldn’t	 decide	 if	 I’d	 been
mistreated.	 By	 Richard,	 by
those	 boys	 who	 took	 my
virginity,	 by	 anyone.	 I	 was
never	 really	 on	 my	 side	 in
any	argument.	I	liked	the	Old
Testament	 spitefulness	 of	 the
phrase	got	what	she	deserved.
Sometimes	women	do.
Silence	and	then	not.	Theyellow	 IROC	 rumbled	 up
next	to	me,	Amma	and	Kylie
sharing	 the	 front	 passenger’s
seat.	 A	 scraggly	 haired	 boy
wearing	 gas-station	 shades
and	 a	 stained	 undershirt	 was
in	the	driver’s	seat;	his	skinny
doppelgänger	in	back.	Smoke
rolled	 out	 of	 the	 car,	 along
with	 the	 smell	 of	 citrus-
flavored	liquor.
“Get	 in,	 we’re	 going	 to
party	 a	 little,”	 Amma	 said.
She	 was	 a	 proffering	 a	 bottleof	 cheap	 orange-flavored
vodka.	 She	 stuck	 her	 tongue
out	 and	 let	 a	 raindrop	 splash
on	 it.	 Her	 hair	 and	 tank	 top
were	already	dripping.
“I’m	fine,	thanks.”
“You	don’t	look	it.	Come
on,	 they’re	 patrolling	 the
park.	 You’ll	 get	 a	 DUI	 for
sure.	I	can	smell	you.”
“Come	 on,	 chiquita,”
Kylie	 called.	 “You	 can	 help
us	keep	these	boys	in	line.”
I	 thought	 about	 myoptions:	 Go	 home,	 drink	 by
myself.	 Go	 to	 a	 bar,	 drink
with	 whatever	 guys	 floated
over.	 Go	 with	 these	 kids,
maybe	 hear	 some	 interesting
gossip	 at	 the	 very	 least.	 An
hour.	 Then	 home	 to	 sleep	 it
off.	 Plus,	 there	 was	 Amma
and	
her	
mysterious
friendliness	 toward	 me.	 I
hated	 to	 admit	 it,	 but	 I	 was
becoming	 obsessed	 with	 the
girl.
The	 kids	 cheered	 as	 I	 gotin	the	backseat.	Amma	passed
around	 a	 different	 bottle,	 hot
rum	 that	 tasted	 like	 suntan
lotion.	 I	 worried	 they’d	 ask
me	 to	 buy	 them	 liquor.	 Not
because	
I	
wouldn’t.
Pathetically,	I	wanted	them	to
just	 want	 me	 along.	 Like	 I
was	 popular	 once	 again.	 Not
a	 freak.	 Approved	 of	 by	 the
coolest	 girl	 in	 school.	 The
thought	was	almost	enough	to
make	me	jump	out	of	the	car
and	 walk	 home.	 But	 thenAmma	 passed	 the	 bottle
again.	 The	 rim	 was	 ringed
with	pink	lip	gloss.
The	 boy	 next	 to	 me,
introduced	 only	 as	 Nolan,
nodded	 and	 wiped	 sweat	 off
his	 upper	 lip.	 Skinny	 arms
with	 scabs	 and	 a	 face	 full	 of
acne.	 Meth.	 Missouri	 is	 the
second-most	addicted	state	in
the	 Union.	 We	 get	 bored
down	here,	and	we	have	a	lot
of	 farm	 chemicals.	 When	 I
grew	 up,	 it	 was	 mostly	 thehard	cores	that	did	it.	Now	it
was	 a	 party	 drug.	 Nolan	 was
running	 his	 finger	 up	 and
down	the	vinyl	ribbing	of	the
driver’s	 seat	 in	 front	 of	 him,
but	 he	 looked	 up	 at	 me	 long
enough	 to	 say,	 “You’re	 like
my	mom’s	age.	I	like	it.”
“I	 doubt	 I’m	 quite	 your
mom’s	age.”
“She’s	 like,	 thirty-three,
thirty-four?”	Close	enough.
“What’s	her	name?”
“Casey	Rayburn.”	I	knewher.	Few	years	older	than	me.
Factory	 side.	 Too	 much	 hair
gel	 and	 a	 fondness	 for	 the
Mexican	chicken	killers	down
on	 the	 Arkansas	 border.
During	 a	 church	 retreat,	 she
told	 her	 group	 she’d	 tried	 to
commit	 suicide.	 The	 girls	 at
school	 started	 calling	 her
Casey	Razor.
“Must	 have	 been	 before
my	time,”	I	said.
“Dude,	this	chick	was	too
cool	 to	 hang	 with	 yourdruggie	 whore	 momma,”	 the
driver	said.
“Fuck	 you,”	 Nolan
whispered.
“Camille,	 look	 what	 we
got,”	 Amma	 leaned	 over	 the
passenger’s	 seat,	 so	 her	 rear
was	 bumping	 Kylie’s	 face.
She	 shook	 a	 bottle	 of	 pills	 at
me.	 “OxyContin.	 Makes	 you
feel	real	good.”	She	stuck	out
her	tongue	and	placed	three	in
a	row	like	white	buttons,	then
chewed	and	swallowed	with	agulp	of	vodka.	“Try.”
“No	 thanks,	 Amma.”
OxyContin	 is	 good	 stuff.
Doing	 it	 with	 your	 kid	 sister
isn’t.
“Oh,	come	on,	Mille,	just
one,”	 she	 wheedled.	 “You’ll
feel	 lighter.	 I	 feel	 so	 happy
and	 good	 right	 now.	 You
have	to,	too.”
“I	 feel	 fine,	 Amma.”	 Her
calling	 me	 Mille	 took	 me
back	to	Marian.	“I	promise.”
She	 turned	 back	 aroundand	
sighed,	
looking
irretrievably	glum.
“Come	 on,	 Amma,	 you
can’t	 care	 that	 much,”	 I	 said,
touching	her	shoulder.
“I	did.”	I	couldn’t	take	it,
I	 was	 losing	 ground,	 feeling
that	dangerous	need	to	please,
just	 like	 the	 old	 days.	 And
really,	 one	 wasn’t	 going	 to
kill	me.
“Okay,	 okay,	 give	 me
one.	One.”
She	
immediatelybrightened	 and	 flung	 herself
back	to	face	me.
“Put	 out	 your	 tongue.
Like	 communion.	 Drug
communion.”
I	 put	 out	 my	 tongue	 and
she	set	the	pill	on	the	tip,	and
squealed.
“Good	girl.”	She	smiled.	I
was	 getting	 tired	 of	 that
phrase	today.
	
We	pulled	up	outside	one
of	 Wind	 Gap’s	 great	 oldVictorian	
mansions,
completely	 renovated	 and
repainted	 in	 ludicrous	 blues
and	 pinks	 and	 greens	 that
were	 supposed	 to	 be	 funky.
Instead	 the	 place	 looked	 like
the	home	of	a	mad	ice-cream
man.	A	boy	with	no	shirt	was
throwing	 up	 in	 the	 bushes	 to
the	 side	 of	 the	 house,	 two
kids	 were	 wrestling	 in	 what
was	 left	 of	 a	 flower	 garden,
and	 a	 young	 couple	 was	 in
full	 spider	 embrace	 on	 achild’s	 swing.	 Nolan	 was
abandoned	 in	 the	 car,	 still
running	 his	 fingers	 up	 and
down	that	piping.	The	driver,
Damon,	locked	him	in	“so	no
one	 fucks	 with	 him.”	 I	 found
it	a	charming	gesture.
Thanks	to	the	OxyContin,
I	was	feeling	quite	game,	and
as	 we	 walked	 into	 the
mansion,	 I	 caught	 myself
looking	 for	 faces	 from	 my
youth:	 boys	 in	 buzz	 cuts	 and
letter	jackets,	girls	with	spiralperms	 and	 chunky	 gold
earrings.	 The	 smell	 of
Drakkar	Noir	and	Georgio.
All	 gone.	 The	 boys	 here
were	 babies	 in	 loose	 skater
shorts	 and	 sneakers,	 the	 girls
in	halters	and	mini	skirts	and
belly	rings,	and	they	were	all
staring	at	me	as	if	I	might	be
a	 cop.	 No,	 but	 I	 fucked	 one
this	 afternoon.	 I	 smiled	 and
nodded.	I	am	terribly	chipper,
I	thought	mindlessly.
In	 the	 cavernous	 diningroom,	 the	 table	 had	 been
pushed	 to	 one	 side	 to	 make
room	for	dancing	and	coolers.
Amma	bopped	into	the	circle,
grinded	 against	 a	 boy	 until
the	 back	 of	 his	 neck	 turned
red.	 She	 whispered	 into	 his
ear,	and	with	his	nod,	opened
up	 a	 cooler	 and	 plucked	 out
four	 beers,	 which	 she	 held
against	 her	 wet	 bosom,
pretending	 to	 have	 a	 hard
time	 juggling	 them	 as	 she
jiggled	 past	 an	 appreciativegroup	of	boys.
The	 girls	 were	 less	 so.	 I
could	 see	 the	 sniping	 zip
through	 the	 party	 like	 a	 line
of	 firecrackers.	 But	 the	 little
blondes	had	two	things	going
for	 them.	 First,	 they	 were
with	 the	 local	 drug	 dealer,
who	 was	 sure	 to	 swing	 some
clout.	 Second,	 they	 were
prettier	than	almost	any	other
female	there,	which	meant	the
boys	 would	 refuse	 to	 boot
them.	 And	 this	 party	 washosted	 by	 a	 boy,	 as	 I	 could
tell	 by	 the	 photos	 on	 the
living-room	 mantel,	 a	 dark-
haired	kid,	blandly	handsome,
posing	 in	 cap	 and	 gown	 for
his	 senior	 photo;	 nearby,	 a
shot	 of	 his	 proud	 father	 and
mother.	 I	 knew	 Mom:	 She
was	the	older	sister	of	one	of
my	 high-school	 friends.	 The
idea	 that	 I	 was	 at	 her	 child’s
party	 gave	 me	 my	 first	 wave
of	nerves.
“OhmigodohmigodohmigoA	brunette	with	frogeyes	and
a	 T-shirt	 proudly	 blaring	 The
Gap	 ran	 past	 us	 and	 grabbed
a	 similarly	 amphibious-
looking	 girl.	 “They	 came.
They	totally	came.”
“Shit,”	 replied	 her	 friend.
“This	is	too	good.	Do	we	say
hello?”
“I	 think	 we	 wait	 and	 see
what	 happens.	 If	 J.C.	 doesn’t
want	 them	 here,	 then	 we	 got
to	stay	out	of	it.”
“Totally.”I	 knew	 before	 I	 saw	 him.
Meredith	Wheeler	entered	the
living	 room,	 tugging	 John
Keene	 behind.	 A	 few	 guys
gave	him	nods,	a	few	offered
pats	 on	 the	 shoulder.	 Others
pointedly	 turned	 their	 backs
and	 closed	 their	 circles.
Neither	 John	 nor	 Meredith
noticed	 me,	 for	 which	 I	 was
relieved.	 Meredith	 spotted	 a
circle	 of	 skinny	 bow-legged
girls,	 fellow	 cheerleaders,	 I
assumed,	standing	at	the	doorof	 the	 kitchen.	 She	 squealed
and	 hopped	 over	 to	 them,
stranding	 John	 in	 the	 living
room.	 The	 girls	 were	 even
chillier	 than	 the	 guys	 had
been.	 “Hiiiii,”	 said	 one
without	 smiling.	 “I	 thought
you	 said	 you	 weren’t
coming.”
“I	 decided	 that	 was	 just
stupid.	 Anyone	 with	 a	 brain
knows	John’s	cool.	We’re	not
going	 to	 be	 fucking	 outcasts
just	 because	 of	 all	 this...crap.”
“It’s	 not	 cool,	 Meredith.
J.C.	 is	 not	 cool	 with	 this,”
said	a	redhead	who	was	either
J.C.’s	 girlfriend	 or	 wanted	 to
be.
“I’ll	 talk	 to	 him,”
Meredith	 whined.	 “Let	 me
talk	to	him.”
“I	 think	 you	 should	 just
go.”
“Did	 they	 really	 take
John’s	clothes?”	asked	a	third
tiny	 girl	 who	 had	 a	 maternalair	 about	 her.	 The	 one	 who
ended	 up	 holding	 hair	 while
her	friends	threw	up.
“Yes,	 but	 that’s	 to
completely	eliminate	him.	It’s
not	because	he’s	in	trouble.”
“Whatever,”	 said	 the
redhead.	I	hated	her.
Meredith	 scanned	 the
room	 for	 more	 friendly	 faces
and	 spotted	 me,	 looked
confused,	 spotted	 Kelsey,
looked	furious.
Leaving	John	by	the	door,pretending	 to	 check	 his
watch,	 tie	 his	 shoe,	 look
nonchalant	 as	 the	 crowds
kicked	into	full	scandal	buzz,
she	strode	over	to	us.
“What	 are	 you	 doing
here?”	 Her	 eyes	 were	 full	 of
tears,	 beads	 of	 sweat	 on	 her
forehead.	 The	 question
seemed	 to	 be	 addressed	 to
neither	of	us.	Maybe	she	was
asking	herself.
“Damon	 brought	 us,”
Amma	 chirped.	 She	 hoppedtwice	 on	 the	 tips	 of	 her	 feet.
“I	 can’t	 believe	 you’re	 here.
And	I	definitely	can’t	believe
he’s	showing	his	face.”
“God,	 you’re	 such	 a	 little
bitch.	You	know	nothing,	you
fucking	 druggie	 fucker.”
Meredith’s	
voice	
was
quivering,	 like	 a	 top	 twirling
toward	the	edge	of	a	table.
“Better	 than	 what	 you’re
fucking,”	 Amma	 said.	 “Hiiii,
murderer.”	 She	 waved	 at
John,	 who	 seemed	 to	 noticeher	 for	 the	 first	 time	 and
suddenly	 looked	 like	 he’d
been	smacked.
He	 was	 about	 to	 walk
over	when	J.C.	appeared	from
another	 room	 and	 took	 John
aside.	 Two	 tall	 boys
discussing	 death	 and	 house
parties.	 The	 room	 tuned	 to	 a
low	 whisper,	 watching.	 J.C.
patted	 John	 on	 the	 back,	 in	 a
way	 that	 aimed	 him	 directly
for	 the	 door.	 John	 nodded	 to
Meredith	and	headed	out.	Shefollowed	 quickly,	 her	 head
bowed,	 hands	 up	 to	 her	 face.
Just	 before	 John	 made	 it	 to
the	door,	some	boy	blurted	in
a	 high	 teasing	 voice,
“Babykiller!”	Nervous	laughs
and	 eye	 rolling.	 Meredith
screeched	 once,	 wildly,
turned	 around,	 teeth	 bared,
yelled,	 “Fuck	 y’all”	 and
slammed	the	door.
The	 same	 boy	 mimicked
it	for	the	crowd,	a	coy,	girlish
Fuck	y’all,	jutting	his	hip	outto	 one	 side.	 J.C.	 turned	 the
music	 back	 up,	 a	 teenage
girl’s	 synthesized	 pop	 voice
teasing	about	blow	jobs.
I	 wanted	 to	 follow	 John
and	 just	 put	 my	 arms	 around
him.	 I’d	 never	 seen	 anyone
look	 so	 lonesome,	 and
Meredith	 seemed	 unlikely	 to
be	 of	 solace.	 What	 would	 he
do,	 back	 by	 himself	 in	 that
empty	carriage	house?	Before
I	 could	 run	 after	 him,	 Amma
grabbed	 my	 hand	 and	 pulledme	 upstairs	 to	 “The	 VIP
Room,”	 where	 she	 and	 the
blondes	 and	 two	 high-school
boys	 with	 matching	 shaved
heads	 rifled	 through	 J.C.’s
mom’s	 closet,	 flinging	 her
best	clothes	off	the	hangers	to
make	a	nest.	They	clambered
on	 the	 bed	 in	 the	 circle	 of
satin	and	furs,	Amma	pulling
me	next	to	her	and	producing
a	 button	 of	 Ecstasy	 from	 her
bra.
“You	ever	played	a	gameof	 Rolling	 Roulette?”	 she
asked	 me.	 I	 shook	 my	 head.
“You	pass	the	X	around	from
tongue	 to	 tongue,	 and	 the
tongue	 it	 dissolves	 on	 last	 is
the	 lucky	 winner.	 This	 is
Damon’s	best	shit,	though,	so
we’ll	all	roll	a	little.”
“No	 thanks,	 I’m	 good,”	 I
said.	I’d	almost	agreed	until	I
saw	 the	 alarmed	 look	 on	 the
boys’	 faces.	 I	 must	 have
reminded	 them	 of	 their
mothers.“Oh,	 come	 on,	 Camille,	 I
won’t	 tell,	 for	 Chrissakes,”
Amma	 whined,	 picking	 at	 a
fingernail.	 “Do	 it	 with	 me.
Sisters?”
“Pleeease,	
Camille!”
moaned	 Kylie	 and	 Kelsey.
Jodes	watched	me	silently.
The	 OxyContin	 and	 the
booze	 and	 the	 sex	 from
earlier	and	the	storm	that	still
hung	 wet	 outside	 and	 my
wrecked	skin	(icebox	popping
eagerly	 on	 one	 arm)	 and	 thestained	 thoughts	 of	 my
mother.	 I	 don’t	 know	 which
hit	hardest	but	suddenly	I	was
allowing	 Amma	 to	 kiss	 my
cheek	 excitedly.	 I	 was
nodding	 yes,	 and	 Kylie’s
tongue	 hit	 one	 boy,	 who
nervously	 passed	 the	 pill	 to
Kelsey,	 who	 licked	 the
second	boy,	his	tongue	big	as
a	 wolf’s,	 who	 slopped	 over
Jodes,	 who	 wobbled	 her
tongue	 hesitantly	 out	 to
Amma—who	 lapped	 the	 pillup,	and,	tongue	soft	and	little
and	hot,	passed	the	X	into	my
mouth,	 wrapping	 her	 arms
around	 me	 and	 pushing	 the
pill	down	hard	on	my	tongue
until	I	could	feel	it	crumble	in
my	 mouth.	 It	 dissolved	 like
cotton	candy.
“Drink	lots	of	water,”	she
whispered	to	me,	then	giggled
loudly	 at	 the	 circle,	 flinging
herself	back	on	a	mink.
“Fuck,	 Amma,	 the	 game
hadn’t	even	started,”	the	wolfboy	 snapped,	 his	 cheeks
flushed	red.
“Camille	 is	 my	 guest,”
Amma	 said	 mock	 haughtily.
“Plus,	 she	 could	 use	 a	 little
sunshine.	 She’s	 had	 a	 pretty
shitty	 life.	 We	 have	 a	 dead
sister	 just	 like	 John	 Keene.
She’s	 never	 dealt	 with	 it.”
She	 announced	 it	 as	 if	 she
were	 helping	 break	 the	 ice
between	cocktail	party	guests:
David	 owns	 his	 own	 dry-
goods	 store,	 James	 justreturned	 from	 an	 assignment
in	 France,	 and,	 oh,	 yes,
Camille	has	never	gotten	over
her	dead	sister.	Can	I	refresh
anyone’s	drink?
“I’ve	 got	 to	 go,”	 I	 said,
standing	 too	 abruptly,	 a	 red
satin	 halter	 clinging	 to	 my
backside.	 I	 had	 about	 fifteen
minutes	 till	 I	 really	 started
rolling,	and	this	wasn’t	where
I	 wanted	 to	 be	 when	 it
happened.	Again,	though,	the
problem:	 Richard,	 while	 adrinker,	 wasn’t	 likely	 to
condone	 anything	 more
serious,	 and	 I	 sure	 as	 hell
didn’t	 want	 to	 sit	 in	 my
steamy	 bedroom,	 alone	 and
high,	listening	for	my	mother.
“Come	 with	 me,”	 Amma
offered.	 She	 slipped	 a	 hand
into	 her	 overpadded	 bra	 and
pulled	 a	 pill	 from	 its	 lining,
popping	 it	 in	 her	 mouth	 and
smiling	huge	and	cruel	at	the
rest	 of	 the	 kids,	 who	 looked
hopeful	but	daunted.	None	forthem.
“We’ll	 go	 swimming,
Mille,	 it’ll	 feel	 so	 outrageous
when	 we	 start	 rolling,”	 she
grinned,	 flashing	 perfect
square	 white	 teeth.	 I	 had	 no
fight	left—it	seemed	easier	to
go	 along.	 We	 were	 down	 the
stairs,	into	the	kitchen	(peach-
faced	 young	 boys	 assessing
us	 with	 confusion—one	 a
shade	 too	 young,	 one
definitely	 too	 old).	 We	 were
grabbing	 bottled	 water	 fromthe	 icebox	 (that	 word
suddenly	panting	again	on	my
skin,	 like	 a	 puppy	 spotting	 a
bigger	 dog),	 which	 was
jammed	 with	 juices	 and
casseroles,	 fresh	 fruit	 and
white	 bread,	 and	 I	 was
suddenly	 touched	 by	 this
innocent,	 healthy	 family
refrigerator,	 so	 oblivious	 to
the	 debauchery	 occurring
elsewhere	in	the	house.
“Let’s	 go,	 I’m	 so	 excited
to	 swim,”	 Amma	 declaredwildly,	pulling	at	my	arm	like
a	child.	Which	she	was.	I	am
doing	drugs	with	my	thirteen-
year-old	sister,	I	whispered	to
myself.	 But	 a	 good	 ten
minutes	 had	 passed,	 and	 the
idea	 brought	 only	 a	 flutter	 of
happiness.	She	was	a	fun	girl,
my	 little	 sister,	 the	 most
popular	girl	in	Wind	Gap,	and
she	 wanted	 to	 hang	 out	 with
me.	She	loves	me	like	Marian
did.	 I	 smiled.	 The	 X	 had
released	 its	 first	 wave	 ofchemical	 optimism,	 I	 could
feel	it	float	up	inside	me	like
a	big	test	balloon	and	splatter
on	 the	 roof	 of	 my	 mouth,
spraying	 good	 cheer.	 I	 could
almost	 taste	 it,	 like	 a	 fizzy
pink	jelly.
Kelsey	 and	 Kylie	 began
following	us	to	the	door,	and
Amma	
swung	
around
laughing.	 “I	 don’t	 want	 you
guys	 to	 come,”	 she	 cackled.
“You	 guys	 get	 to	 stay	 here.
Help	Jodes	get	laid,	she	needsa	good	fuck.”
Kelsey	 scowled	 back	 at
Jodes,	 who	 hung	 nervously
on	 the	 stairs.	 Kylie	 looked	 at
Amma’s	 arm	 around	 my
waist.	 They	 glanced	 at	 each
other.	 Kelsey	 snuggled	 into
Amma,	 put	 her	 head	 on	 her
shoulder.
“We	 don’t	 want	 to	 stay
here,	 we	 want	 to	 come	 with
you,”	she	whined.	“Please.”
Amma	 shrugged	 her
away,	 smiled	 at	 her	 like	 shewas	a	dumb	pony.
“Just	 be	 a	 sweetie	 and
fuck	 off,	 okay?”	 Amma	 said.
“I’m	 so	 tired	 of	 all	 of	 you.
You’re	such	bores.”
Kelsey	
hung	
back,
confused,	 her	 arms	 still	 half
outstretched.	 Kylie	 shrugged
at	 her	 and	 danced	 back	 into
the	 crowd,	 grabbing	 a	 beer
from	 an	 older	 boy’s	 hands
and	 licking	 her	 lips	 at	 him—
looking	 back	 over	 to	 see	 if
Amma	 was	 watching.	 Shewasn’t.
Instead,	 Amma	 was
steering	 me	 out	 the	 door	 like
an	 attentive	 date,	 down	 the
stairs	 and	 onto	 the	 sidewalk,
where	 tiny	 yellow	 oxalis
weeds	 spurted	 from	 the
cracks.
I	pointed.	“Beautiful.”
Amma	 pointed	 at	 me	 and
nodded.	 “I	 love	 yellow	 when
I’m	 high.	 You	 feeling
something?”	 I	 nodded	 back,
her	face	flicking	on	and	off	aswe	 walked	 past	 streetlamps,
swimming	 forgotten,	 on
autopilot	 in	 the	 direction	 of
Adora’s.	I	could	feel	the	night
hanging	 on	 me	 like	 a	 soft,
damp	 bedgown	 and	 I	 had	 a
flash	 of	 the	 Illinois	 hospital,
me	 waking	 up	 wet	 with
sweat,	 a	 desperate	 whistle	 in
my	 ear.	 My	 roommate,	 the
cheerleader,	 on	 the	 floor
purple	 and	 twitching,	 the
bottle	 of	 Windex	 next	 to	 her.
A	 comedic	 squeaking	 sound.Postmortem	 gas.	 A	 burst	 of
shocked	 laughter	 from	 me,
here	 now,	 in	 Wind	 Gap,
echoing	the	one	I’d	loosed	in
that	 miserable	 room	 in	 the
pale	yellow	morning.
Amma	 put	 her	 hand	 in
mine.	 “What	 do	 you	 think
of...Adora?”
I	 felt	 my	 high	 wobble,
then	regain	its	spin.
“I	 think	 she’s	 a	 very
unhappy	 woman,”	 I	 said.
“And	troubled.”“I	 hear	 her	 calling	 out
names	 when	 she	 takes	 her
naps:	Joya,	Marian...you.”
“Glad	I	don’t	have	to	hear
that,”	 I	 said,	 patting	 Amma’s
hand.	“But	I’m	sorry	you	do.”
“She	 likes	 to	 take	 care	 of
me.”
“Great.”
“It’s	 weird,”	 Amma	 said.
“After	she	takes	care	of	me,	I
like	to	have	sex.”
She	 flipped	 up	 her	 skirt
from	behind,	flashed	me	a	hotpink	thong.
“I	 don’t	 think	 you	 should
let	 boys	 do	 things	 to	 you,
Amma.	Because	that’s	what	it
is.	 It’s	 not	 reciprocal	 at	 your
age.”
“Sometimes	 if	 you	 let
people	 do	 things	 to	 you,
you’re	 really	 doing	 it	 to
them,”	 Amma	 said,	 pulling
another	 Blow	 Pop	 from	 her
pocket.	 Cherry.	 “Know	 what
I	 mean?	 If	 someone	 wants	 to
do	 fucked-up	 things	 to	 you,and	 you	 let	 them,	 you’re
making	them	more	fucked	up.
Then	 you	 have	 the	 control.
As	 long	 as	 you	 don’t	 go
crazy.”
“Amma,	I	just...”	But	she
was	already	burbling	ahead.
“I	like	our	house,”	Amma
interrupted.	 “I	 like	 her	 room.
The	 floor	 is	 famous.	 I	 saw	 it
in	a	magazine	one	time.	They
called	 it	 ‘The	 Ivory	 Toast:
Southern	 Living	 from	 a
Bygone	 Time.’	 Because	 nowof	course	you	can’t	get	ivory.
Too	bad.	Really	too	bad.”
She	 stuck	 the	 sucker	 in
her	 mouth	 and	 snatched	 a
firefly	 from	 the	 air,	 held	 it
between	 two	 fingers	 and
ripped	 out	 its	 back	 end.
Wiped	 the	 light	 around	 her
finger	 to	 make	 a	 glowing
ring.	 She	 dropped	 the	 dying
bug	 into	 the	 grass	 and
admired	her	hand.
“Did	 girls	 like	 you
growing	 up?”	 she	 asked.“Because	 they’re	 definitely
not	nice	to	me.”
I	 tried	 to	 reconcile	 the
idea	 of	 Amma,	 brash,	 bossy,
sometimes	scary	(stepping	on
my	 heels	 at	 the	 park—what
kind	 of	 thirteen-year-old
taunts	adults	like	that?)	with	a
girl	 to	 whom	 anyone	 was
openly	 rude.	 She	 saw	 my
look	and	read	my	thoughts.
“I	 don’t	 mean	 not	 nice	to
me,	 actually.	 They	 do
whatever	I	tell	them.	But	theydon’t	 like	 me.	 The	 second	 I
fuck	 up,	 the	 second	 I	 do
something	 uncool,	 they’ll	 be
the	 first	 to	 gang	 up	 against
me.	 Sometimes	 I	 sit	 in	 my
room	 before	 bed	 and	 I	 write
down	every	single	thing	I	did
and	 said	 that	 day.	 Then	 I
grade	 it,	 A	 for	 a	 perfect
move,	 F	 for	 I	 should	 kill
myself	I’m	such	a	loser.”
When	 I	 was	 in	 high
school,	 I	 kept	 a	 log	 of	 every
outfit	 I	 wore	 each	 day.	 Norepeating	 until	 a	 month	 went
by.
“Like	tonight,	Dave	Rard,
who’s	 a	 very	 hot	 junior,	 told
me	he	didn’t	know	if	he	could
wait	a	year,	you	know,	to	get
with	 me,	 like	 until	 I	 was	 in
high	 school?	 And	 I	 said,	 ‘So
don’t.’	 And	 walked	 away,
and	 all	 the	 guys	 were	 like,
‘Awwwww.’	 So	 that’s	 an	 A.
But	 yesterday,	 I	 tripped	 on
Main	 Street	 in	 front	 of	 the
girls	and	they	laughed.	That’san	 F.	 Maybe	 a	 D,	 because	 I
was	so	mean	to	them	the	rest
of	 the	 day	 Kelsey	 and	 Kylie
both	cried.	And	Jodes	always
cries	 so	 it’s	 not	 really	 a
challenge.”
“Safer	 to	 be	 feared	 than
loved,”	I	said.
“Machiavelli,”	
she
crowed,	 and	 skipped	 ahead
laughing—whether	 in	 a
mocking	gesture	of	her	age	or
genuine	 youthful	 energy,	 I
couldn’t	tell.“How	do	you	know	that?”
I	 was	 impressed,	 and	 liking
her	 more	 every	 minute.	 A
smart,	 fucked-up	 little	 girl.
Sounded	familiar.
“I	 know	 tons	 of	 things	 I
shouldn’t	 know,”	 she	 said,
and	 I	 began	 skipping
alongside	 her.	 The	 X	 had	 me
wired,	and	while	I	was	aware
that	
under	
sober
circumstances	 I	 wouldn’t	 be
doing	 it,	 I	 was	 too	 happy	 to
care.	 My	 muscles	 weresinging.
“I’m	actually	smarter	than
most	 of	 my	 teachers.	 I	 took
an	IQ	test.	I’m	supposed	to	be
in	 tenth	 grade,	 but	 Adora
thinks	 I	 need	 to	 be	 with	 kids
my	age.	Whatever.	I’m	going
away	 for	 high	 school.	 To
New	England.”
She	said	it	with	the	slight
wonder	 of	 someone	 who
knew	the	region	only	through
photos,	of	a	girl	harboring	Ivy
League–sponsored	 images:New	 England’s	 where	 the
smart	 people	 go.	 Not	 that	 I
should	judge,	I’ve	never	been
there	either.
“I’ve	 got	 to	 get	 out	 of
here,”	 Amma	 said	 with	 the
exhausted	 affectation	 of	 a
pampered	 housewife.	 “I’m
bored	all	the	time.	That’s	why
I	 act	 out.	 I	 know	 I	 can	 be	 a
little...off.”
“With	the	sex	you	mean?”
I	 stopped,	 my	 heart	 making
rumba	 thumps	 in	 my	 chest.The	air	smelled	of	irises,	and
I	 could	 feel	 the	 scent	 float
into	 my	 nose,	 my	 lungs,	 my
blood.	My	veins	would	smell
of	purple.
“Just,	 you	 know,	 lashing
out.	 You	 know.	 I	 know	 you
know.”	 She	 took	 my	 hand
and	 offered	 me	 a	 pure,	 sweet
smile,	 petting	 my	 palm,
which	 might	 have	 felt	 better
than	 any	 touch	 I’d	 ever
experienced.	 On	 my	 left	 calf
freak	sighed	suddenly.“How	 do	 you	 lash	 out?”
We	 were	 near	 my	 mother’s
house	now,	and	my	high	was
in	 full	 bloom.	 My	 hair
swished	on	my	shoulders	like
warm	 water	 and	 I	 swayed
side	 to	 side	 to	 no	 particular
music.	A	snail	shell	lay	on	the
edge	 of	 the	 sidewalk	 and	 my
eyes	looped	into	its	curlicue.
“You	 know.	 You	 know
how	 sometimes	 you	 need	 to
hurt.”
She	 said	 it	 as	 if	 she	 wereselling	a	new	hair	product.
“There	 are	 better	 ways	 to
deal	 with	 boredom	 and
claustrophobia	than	to	hurt,”	I
said.	 “You’re	 a	 smart	 girl,
you	know	that.”
I	realized	her	fingers	were
inside	 the	 cuffs	 of	 my	 shirt,
touching	 the	 ridges	 of	 my
scars.	I	didn’t	stop	her.
“Do	you	cut,	Amma?”
“I	 hurt,”	 she	 squealed,
and	 twirled	 out	 onto	 the
street,	spinning	flamboyantly,her	 head	 back,	 her	 arms
outstretched	 like	 a	 swan.	 “I
love	 it!”	 she	 screamed.	 The
echo	 ran	 down	 the	 street,
where	 my	 mother’s	 house
stood	watch	on	the	corner.
Amma	 spun	 until	 she
clattered	to	the	pavement,	one
of	 her	 silver	 bangle	 bracelets
dislodging	 and	 rolling	 down
the	street	drunkenly.
I	 wanted	 to	 talk	 to	 her
about	 this,	 be	 the	 grown-up,
but	 the	 X	 swooped	 me	 upagain,	 and	 instead	 I	 grabbed
her	from	the	street	(laughing,
her	 elbow	 split	 open	 and
bleeding)	and	we	swung	each
other	in	circles	on	the	way	to
our	 mother’s	 house.	 Her	 face
was	 split	 in	 two	 with	 her
smile,	her	teeth	wet	and	long,
and	I	realized	how	entrancing
they	 might	 be	 to	 a	 killer.
Square	 blocks	 of	 shiny	 bone,
the	 front	 ones	 like	 mosaic
tiles	 you	 might	 press	 into	 a
table.“I’m	so	happy	with	you,”
Amma	 laughed,	 her	 breath
hot	 and	 sweetly	 boozy	 in	 my
face.	 “You’re	 like	 my	 soul
mate.”
“You’re	like	my	sister,”	I
said.	Blasphemy?	Didn’t	care.
“I	 love	 you,”	 Amma
screamed.
We	 were	 spinning	 so	 fast
my	 cheeks	 were	 flapping,
tickling	 me.	 I	 was	 laughing
like	 a	 kid.	 I	 have	 never	 been
happier	 than	 right	 now,	 Ithought.	 The	 streetlight	 was
almost	 rosy,	 and	 Amma’s
long	 hair	 was	 feathering	 my
shoulders,	
her	
high
cheekbones	 jutted	 out	 like
scoops	of	butter	in	her	tanned
skin.	 I	 reached	 out	 to	 touch
one,	 releasing	 my	 hand	 from
hers,	and	the	unlinking	of	our
circle	caused	us	to	spin	wildly
to	the	ground.
I	felt	my	ankle	bone	crack
against	 the	 curb—pop!—
blood	 exploding,	 splatteringup	 my	 leg.	 Red	 bubbles
began	
sprouting	
onto
Amma’s	 chest	 from	 her	 own
skid	across	the	pavement.	She
looked	 down,	 looked	 at	 me,
all	 glowing	 blue	 husky	 eyes,
ran	 her	 fingers	 across	 the
bloody	 web	 on	 her	 chest	 and
shrieked	 once,	 long,	 then	 lay
her	head	on	my	lap	laughing.
She	 swiped	 a	 finger
across	 her	 chest,	 balancing	 a
flat	 button	 of	 blood	 on	 her
fingertip,	 and	 before	 I	 couldstop	her,	rubbed	it	on	my	lips.
I	 could	 taste	 it,	 like	 honeyed
tin.	 She	 looked	 up	 at	 me	 and
stroked	my	face,	and	I	let	her.
“I	 know	 you	 think	 Adora
likes	 me	 better,	 but	 it’s	 not
true,”	 she	 said.	 As	 if	 on	 cue,
the	 porch	 light	 of	 our	 house,
way	 atop	 the	 hill,	 switched
on.
“You	want	to	sleep	in	my
room?”	 Amma	 offered,	 a
little	quieter.
I	 pictured	 us	 in	 her	 bedunder	 her	 polka-dot	 covers,
whispering	 secrets,	 falling
asleep	 tangled	 with	 each
other,	 and	 then	 I	 realized	 I
was	 imagining	 me	 and
Marian.	 She,	 escaped	 from
her	 hospital	 bed,	 asleep	 next
to	me.	The	hot	purring	sounds
she	 made	 as	 she	 curled	 into
my	 belly.	 I’d	 have	 to	 sneak
her	 back	 to	 her	 room	 before
my	 mother	 woke	 in	 the
morning.	 High	 drama	 in	 a
quiet	 house,	 those	 fiveseconds,	pulling	her	down	the
hallway,	 near	 my	 mother’s
room,	 fearing	 the	 door	 might
swing	 open	 right	 then,	 yet
almost	hoping.	She’s	not	sick,
Momma.	 It’s	 what	 I	 planned
on	 yelling	 if	 we	 were	 ever
caught.	 It’s	 okay	 she’s	 out	 of
bed	 because	 she’s	 not	 really
sick.	 I’d	 forgotten	 how
desperately,	 positively	 I
believed	it.
Thanks	 to	 the	 drugs,
however,	 these	 were	 onlyhappy	 recollections	 now,
flipping	 past	 my	 brain	 like
pages	 of	 a	 child’s	 storybook.
Marian	 took	 on	 a	 bunnylike
aura	 in	 these	 memories,	 a
little	cottontail	dressed	as	my
sister.	 I	 was	 almost	 feeling
her	fur	when	I	roused	myself
to	 discover	 Amma’s	 hair
brushing	 up	 and	 down	 my
leg.
“So,	wanna?”	she	asked.
“Not	 tonight,	 Amma.	 I’m
dead	tired	and	I	want	to	sleepin	 my	 own	 bed.”	 It	 was	 true.
The	 drug	 was	 fast	 and	 hard
and	 then	 gone.	 I	 felt	 ten
minutes	 from	 sober,	 and	 I
didn’t	 want	 Amma	 around
when	I	hit	ground.
“Can	 I	 sleep	 over	 with
you	 then?”	 She	 stood	 in	 the
streetlight,	 her	 jean	 skirt
hanging	 from	 her	 tiny	 hip
bones,	 her	 halter	 askew	 and
ripped.	A	smear	of	blood	near
her	lips.	Hopeful.
“Naw.	 Let’s	 just	 sleepseparate.	 We’ll	 hang	 out
tomorrow.”
She	 said	 nothing,	 just
turned	 and	 ran	 as	 fast	 as	 she
could	 toward	 the	 house,	 her
feet	 kicking	 up	 behind	 her
like	a	cartoon	colt’s.
“Amma!”	 I	 called	 after.
“Wait,	you	can	stay	with	me,
okay?”	 I	 began	 running	 after
her.	Watching	her	through	the
drugs	 and	 the	 dark	 was	 like
trying	to	track	someone	while
looking	backward	in	a	mirror.I	 failed	 to	 realize	 her
bouncing	 silhouette	 had
turned	 around,	 and	 that	 she
was	in	fact	running	to	me.	At
me.	 She	 smacked	 into	 me
headlong,	 her	 forehead
clanging	into	my	jaw,	and	we
fell	 again,	 this	 time	 on	 the
sidewalk.	 My	 head	 made	 a
sharp	 cracking	 noise	 as	 it	 hit
the	pavement,	my	lower	teeth
lit	 up	 in	 pain.	 I	 lay	 for	 a
second	 on	 the	 ground,
Amma’s	 hair	 folded	 in	 myfist,	 a	 firefly	 overhead
throbbing	 in	 time	 to	 my
blood.	 Then	 Amma	 began
cackling,	
grabbing	
her
forehead	 and	 nudging	 the
spot	 that	 was	 already	 a	 dark
blue,	 like	 the	 outline	 of	 a
plum.
“Shit.	 I	 think	 you	 dented
my	face.”
“I	 think	 you	 dented	 the
back	 of	 my	 head,”	 I
whispered.	 I	 sat	 up	 and	 felt
woozy.	 A	 blurt	 of	 blood	 thathad	 been	 stanched	 by	 the
sidewalk	 now	 seeped	 down
my	 neck.	 “Christ,	 Amma.
You’re	too	rough.”
“I	 thought	 you	 liked	 it
rough.”	 She	 reached	 a	 hand
and	 pulled	 me	 up,	 the	 blood
in	 my	 head	 sloshing	 from
back	to	front.	Then	she	took	a
tiny	 gold	 ring	 with	 a	 pale
green	peridot	from	her	middle
finger	and	put	it	on	my	pinky
finger.	 “Here.	 I	 want	 you	 to
have	this.”I	 shook	 my	 head.
“Whoever	 gave	 that	 to	 you
would	want	you	to	keep	it.”
“Adora	 sorta	 did.	 She
doesn’t	 care,	 trust	 me.	 She
was	 going	 to	 give	 it	 to	 Ann
but...well,	 Ann’s	 gone	 now,
so	it	was	just	sitting	there.	It’s
ugly,	 right?	 I	 used	 to	 pretend
that	she	gave	it	to	me.	Which
is	 unlikely	 since	 she	 hates
me.”
“She	 doesn’t	 hate	 you.”
We	 began	 walking	 towardhome,	 the	 porch	 light	 glaring
from	the	top	of	the	hill.
“She	 doesn’t	 like	 you,”
Amma	ventured.
“No,	she	doesn’t.”
“Well,	 she	 doesn’t	 like
me	 either.	 Just	 in	 a	 different
way.”	 We	 climbed	 the	 stairs,
squishing	 mulberries	 beneath
our	 feet.	 The	 air	 smelled	 like
icing	on	a	child’s	cake.
“Did	she	like	you	more	or
less	 after	 Marian	 was	 dead?”
she	 asked,	 looping	 her	 arminto	mine.
“Less.”
“So	it	didn’t	help.”
“What?”
“Her	 dying	 didn’t	 help
things.”
“No.	 Now	 keep	 quiet	 till
we	get	to	my	room,	okay?”
We	 padded	 up	 the	 stairs,
me	 holding	 a	 hand	 under	 the
crook	of	my	neck	to	catch	the
blood,	
Amma	
trailing
dangerously	 behind,	 pausing
to	 smell	 a	 rose	 in	 the	 hallvase,	 cracking	 a	 smile	 at	 her
reflection	 in	 the	 mirror.
Silence	as	usual	from	Adora’s
bedroom.	 That	 fan	 whirring
in	 the	 dark	 behind	 the	 closed
door.
I	shut	the	door	of	my	own
room	 behind	 us,	 peeled	 off
my	 rain-drenched	 sneakers
(checked	 with	 squares	 of
newly	 cut	 grass),	 wiped
smashed	 mulberry	 juice	 off
my	leg,	and	began	pulling	up
my	shirt	before	I	felt	Amma’sstare.	 Shirt	 back	 down,	 I
pretended	 to	 sway	 into	 bed,
too	 exhausted	 to	 undress.	 I
pulled	 the	 covers	 up	 and
curled	 away	 from	 Amma,
mumbling	 a	 good	 night.	 I
heard	 her	 drop	 her	 clothes	 to
the	floor,	and	in	a	second	the
light	 was	 off	 and	 she	 was	 in
bed	 curled	 behind	 me,	 naked
except	 for	 her	 panties.	 I
wanted	 to	 cry	 at	 the	 idea	 of
being	 able	 to	 sleep	 next	 to
someone	 without	 clothes,	 noworries	 about	 what	 word
might	 slip	 out	 from	 under	 a
sleeve	or	pantcuff.
“Camille?”	 Her	 voice
quiet	 and	 girlish	 and	 unsure.
“You	 know	 how	 people
sometimes	 say	 they	 have	 to
hurt	 because	 if	 they	 don’t,
they’re	 so	 numb	 they	 won’t
feel	anything?”
“Mmm.”
“What	 if	 it’s	 the
opposite?”	Amma	whispered.
“What	 if	 you	 hurt	 because	 itfeels	so	good?	Like	you	have
a	tingling,	like	someone	left	a
switch	 on	 in	 your	 body.	 And
nothing	 can	 turn	 the	 switch
off	 except	 hurting?	 What
does	that	mean?”
I	pretended	to	be	asleep.	I
pretended	 not	 to	 feel	 her
fingers	 tracing	 vanish	 over
and	 over	 on	 the	 back	 of	 my
neck.
	
A	 dream.	 Marian,	 her
white	 nightgown	 sticky	 withsweat,	 a	 blonde	 curl	 pasted
across	 her	 cheek.	 She	 takes
my	 hand	 and	 tries	 to	 pull	 me
from	bed.	“It’s	not	safe	here,”
she	 whispers.	 “It’s	 not	 safe
for	 you.”	 I	 tell	 her	 to	 leave
me	be.	
Chapter	Thirteen
It	 was	 past	 two	 when	 I
woke,	 my	 stomach	 coiled	 in
on	itself,	my	jaw	aching	from
grinding	 my	 teeth	 for	 five
hours	 straight.	 Fucking	 X.
Amma	 had	 problems,	 too,	 I
guessed.	She’d	left	a	tiny	pile
of	 eyelashes	 on	 the	 pillow
next	to	me.	I	swept	them	into
the	 palm	 of	 my	 hand	 and
stirred	 them	 around.	 Stiffwith	mascara,	they	left	a	dark
blue	smudge	in	the	hollow	of
my	 palm.	 I	 dusted	 them	 off
into	 a	 saucer	 on	 my	 bedside
table.	 Then	 I	 went	 to	 the
bathroom	 and	 threw	 up.	 I
never	 mind	 throwing	 up.
When	I’d	get	sick	as	a	child,	I
remember	my	mother	holding
my	 hair	 back,	 her	 voice
soothing:	 Get	 all	 that	 bad
stuff	 out,	 sweetheart.	 Don’t
stop	till	it’s	all	out.	Turns	out
I	 like	 that	 retching	 andweakness	
and	
spit.
Predictable,	I	know,	but	true.
I	locked	my	door,	stripped
off	 all	 my	 clothes,	 and	 got
back	 in	 bed.	 My	 head	 ached
from	my	left	ear,	through	my
neck,	and	down	my	spine.	My
bowels	 were	 shifting,	 I	 could
barely	 move	 my	 mouth	 for
the	 pain,	 and	 my	 ankle	 was
on	 fire.	 And	 I	 was	 still
bleeding,	I	could	see	from	the
blooms	 of	 red	 all	 over	 my
sheets.	 Amma’s	 side	 wasbloody	 too:	 a	 light	 spray
where	 she’d	 scraped	 her
chest,	 a	 darker	 spot	 on	 the
pillow	itself.
My	heart	was	beating	too
hard,	and	I	couldn’t	catch	my
breath.	 I	 needed	 to	 see	 if	 my
mother	 knew	 what	 had
happened.	 Had	 she	 seen	 her
Amma?	 Was	 I	 in	 trouble?	 I
felt	 panicky	 sick.	 Something
horrible	was	about	to	happen.
Through	my	paranoia,	I	knew
what	was	really	going	on:	Myserotonin	levels,	so	jacked	up
from	 the	 drug	 the	 night
before,	 had	 plummeted,	 and
left	me	on	the	dark	side.	I	told
myself	 this	 even	 as	 I	 turned
my	 face	 into	 the	 pillow	 and
began	 sobbing.	 I	 had
forgotten	 about	 those	 girls,
hell,	 never	 really	 thought
about	 them:	 dead	 Ann	 and
dead	 Natalie.	 Worse,	 I	 had
betrayed	Marian,	replaced	her
with	 Amma,	 ignored	 her	 in
my	 dreams.	 There	 would	 beconsequences.	 I	 wept	 in	 the
same	retching,	cleansing	way
I’d	 vomited,	 until	 the	 pillow
was	 wet	 and	 my	 face	 had
ballooned	 like	 a	 drunk’s.
Then	the	door	handle	jiggled.
I	hushed	myself,	stroking	my
cheek,	 hoping	 silence	 would
make	it	go	away.
“Camille.	 Open	 up.”	 My
mother,	 but	 not	 angry.
Coaxing.	 Nice,	 even.	 I
remained	 silent.	 A	 few	 more
jiggles.	 A	 knock.	 Thensilence	 as	 she	 padded	 away
again.
Camille.	 Open	 up.	 The
image	 of	 my	 mother	 sitting
on	 the	 edge	 of	 my	 bed,	 a
spoonful	 of	 sour-smelling
syrup	 hovering	 over	 me.	 Her
medicine	 always	 made	 me
feel	sicker	than	before.	Weak
stomach.	 Not	 as	 bad	 as
Marian’s,	but	still	weak.
My	
hands	
began
sweating.	Please	don’t	let	her
come	 back.	 I	 had	 a	 flash	 ofCurry,	 one	 of	 his	 crappy	 ties
swinging	 wildly	 over	 his
belly,	 busting	 into	 the	 room
to	 save	 me.	 Carrying	 me	 off
in	 his	 smoky	 Ford	 Taurus,
Eileen	 stroking	 my	 hair	 on
the	way	back	to	Chicago.
My	 mother	 slipped	 a	 key
into	 the	 lock.	 I	 never	 knew
she	had	a	key.	She	entered	the
room	 smugly,	 her	 chin	 tilted
high	 as	 usual,	 the	 key
dangling	 from	 a	 long	 pink
ribbon.	 She	 wore	 a	 powderblue	 sundress	 and	 carried	 a
bottle	 of	 rubbing	 alcohol,	 a
box	 of	 tissues,	 and	 a	 satiny
red	cosmetic	bag.
“Hi	 baby,”	 she	 sighed.
“Amma	 told	 me	 about	 what
happened	 to	 you	 two.	 My
poor	 little	 ones.	 She’s	 been
purging	all	morning.	I	swear,
and	 I	 know	 it	 will	 sound
boastful,	 but	 except	 for	 our
own	 little	 outfit,	 meat	 is
getting	 completely	 unreliable
these	days.	Amma	said	it	wasprobably	the	chicken?”
“I	 guess	 so,”	 I	 said.	 I
could	only	run	with	whatever
lie	 Amma	 told.	 It	 was	 clear
she	 could	 maneuver	 better
than	I.
“I	 can’t	 believe	 you	 both
fainted	 right	 on	 our	 own
stairs,	 while	 I	 was	 sleeping
just	 inside.	 I	 hate	 that	 idea,”
Adora	 said.	 “Her	 bruises!
You’d	 have	 thought	 she	 was
in	a	catfight.”
There’s	 no	 way	 mymother	bought	that	story.	She
was	 an	 expert	 in	 illness	 and
injury,	 and	 she	 would	 not	 be
taken	 in	 by	 that	 unless	 she
wanted	 to	 be.	 Now	 she	 was
going	 to	 tend	 to	 me,	 and	 I
was	 too	 weak	 and	 desperate
to	 ward	 her	 off.	 I	 began
crying	again,	unable	to	stop.
“I	feel	sick,	Momma.”
“I	 know,	 baby.”	 She
stripped	 the	 sheet	 off	 me,
flung	it	down	past	my	toes	in
one	efficient	move,	and	whenI	 instinctively	 put	 my	 hands
across	 myself,	 she	 took	 them
and	placed	them	firmly	to	my
side.
“I	 have	 to	 see	 what’s
wrong,	 Camille.”	 She	 tilted
my	jaw	from	side	to	side	and
pulled	 my	 lower	 lip	 down,
like	 she	 was	 inspecting	 a
horse.	 She	 raised	 each	 of	 my
arms	 slowly	 and	 peered	 into
my	 armpits,	 jamming	 fingers
into	the	hollows,	then	rubbed
my	 throat	 to	 feel	 for	 swollenglands.	 I	 remembered	 the
drill.	She	put	a	hand	between
my	
legs,	
quickly,
professionally.	It	was	the	best
way	to	feel	a	temperature,	she
always	 said.	 Then	 she	 softly,
lightly	 drew	 her	 cool	 fingers
down	my	legs,	and	jabbed	her
thumb	 directly	 into	 the	 open
wound	of	my	smashed	ankle.
Bright	
green	
splashes
exploded	in	front	of	my	eyes,
and	 I	 automatically	 tucked
my	 legs	 beneath	 me,	 turnedon	 my	 side.	 She	 used	 the
moment	 to	 poke	 at	 my	 head
until	she	hit	the	smashed-fruit
spot	on	its	crown.
“Just	 another	 little	 bit,
Camille,	 and	 we’ll	 be	 all
over.”	 She	 wet	 her	 tissues
with	 alcohol	 and	 scrubbed	 at
my	 ankle	 until	 I	 couldn’t	 see
anything	 for	 my	 tears	 and
snot.	 Then	 she	 wrapped	 it
tight	 with	 gauze	 that	 she	 cut
with	 tiny	 clippers	 from	 her
cosmetic	 bag.	 The	 woundbegan	 bleeding	 through
immediately	 so	 the	 wrapping
soon	 looked	 like	 the	 flag	 of
Japan:	 pure	 white	 with	 a
defiant	 red	 circle.	 Next	 she
tilted	my	head	down	with	one
hand	 and	 I	 felt	 an	 urgent
tugging	 at	 my	 hair.	 She	 was
cutting	 it	 off	 around	 the
wound.	I	began	to	pull	away.
“Don’t	you	dare,	Camille.
I’ll	 cut	 you.	 Lie	 back	 down
and	 be	 a	 good	 girl.”	 She
pressed	 a	 cool	 hand	 on	 mycheek,	 holding	 my	 head	 in
place	 against	 the	 pillow,	 and
snip	snip	snip,	sawed	through
a	swath	of	my	hair	until	I	felt
a	 release.	 An	 eerie	 exposure
to	 air	 that	 my	 scalp	 was
unused	to.	I	reached	back	and
felt	a	prickly	patch	the	size	of
a	half	dollar	on	my	head.	My
mother	 quickly	 pulled	 my
hand	 away,	 tucked	 it	 against
my	 side,	 and	 began	 rubbing
alcohol	onto	my	scalp.	Again
I	lost	my	breath	the	pain	wasso	stunning.
She	 rolled	 me	 onto	 my
back	and	ran	a	wet	washcloth
over	 my	 limbs	 as	 if	 I	 were
bedridden.	 Her	 eyes	 were
pink	 where	 she’d	 been
pulling	 at	 the	 lashes.	 Her
cheeks	 had	 that	 girlish	 flush.
She	 plucked	 up	 her	 cosmetic
bag	and	began	sifting	through
various	 pillboxes	 and	 tubes,
finding	 a	 square	 of	 folded
tissue	 from	 the	 bottom,
wadded	 and	 slightly	 stained.From	 its	 center	 she	 produced
an	electric	blue	pill.
“One	
second,
sweetheart.”
I	 could	 hear	 her	 hit	 the
steps	 urgently,	 and	 knew	 she
was	 heading	 down	 to	 the
kitchen.	 Then	 those	 same
quick	 steps	 back	 into	 my
room.	She	had	a	glass	of	milk
in	her	hand.
“Here,	Camille,	drink	this
with	it.”
“What	is	it?”“Medicine.	It	will	prevent
infection	 and	 clear	 up	 any
bacteria	 you	 got	 from	 that
food.”
“What	 is	 it?”	 I	 asked
again.
My	mother’s	chest	turned
a	blotchy	pink,	and	her	smile
began	flickering	like	a	candle
in	 a	 draft.	 On,	 off,	 on,	 off	 in
the	space	of	a	second.
“Camille,	 I’m	 your
mother,	 and	 you’re	 in	 my
house.”	 Glassy	 pink	 eyes.	 Iturned	away	from	her	and	hit
another	 streak	 of	 panic.
Something	 bad.	 Something
I’d	done.
“Camille.	
Open.”
Soothing	 voice,	 coaxing.
Nurse	 began	 throbbing	 near
my	left	armpit.
I	 remember	 being	 a	 kid,
rejecting	all	those	tablets	and
medicines,	 and	 losing	 her	 by
doing	so.	She	reminded	me	of
Amma	 and	 her	 Ecstasy,
wheedling,	 needing	 me	 totake	 what	 she	 was	 offering.
To	 refuse	 has	 so	 many	 more
consequences	
than
submitting.	 My	 skin	 was	 on
fire	from	where	she’d	cleaned
me,	 and	 it	 felt	 like	 that
satisfying	 heat	 after	 a	 cut.	 I
thought	 of	 Amma	 and	 how
content	
she’d	
seemed,
wrapped	 in	 my	 mother’s
arms,	fragile	and	sweaty.
I	turned	back	over,	let	my
mother	 put	 the	 pill	 on	 my
tongue,	 pour	 the	 thick	 milkinto	my	throat,	and	kiss	me.
	
Within	 a	 few	 minutes	 I
was	 asleep,	 the	 stink	 of	 my
breath	 floating	 into	 my
dreams	 like	 a	 sour	 fog.	 My
mother	 came	 to	 me	 in	 my
bedroom	 and	 told	 me	 I	 was
ill.	 She	 lay	 on	 top	 of	 me	 and
put	 her	 mouth	 on	 mine.	 I
could	 feel	 her	 breath	 in	 my
throat.	 Then	 she	 began
pecking	 at	 me.	 When	 she
pulled	away,	she	smiled	at	meand	 smoothed	 my	 hair	 back.
Then	 she	 spit	 my	 teeth	 into
her	hands.
	
Dizzy	and	hot,	I	woke	up
at	 dusk,	 drool	 dried	 in	 a
crusty	 line	 down	 my	 neck.
Weak.	 I	 wrapped	 a	 thin	 robe
around	 myself	 and	 began
crying	 again	 when	 I
remembered	 the	 circle	 at	 the
back	of	my	head.	You’re	 just
coming	 down	 from	 the	 X,	 I
whispered	 to	 myself,	 pattingmy	 cheek	 with	 my	 hand.	 A
bad	 haircut	 is	 not	 the	 end	 of
the	 world.	 So	 you	 wear	 a
ponytail.
I	 shuffled	 down	 the
hallway,	my	joints	clicking	in
and	out	of	place,	my	knuckles
swollen	for	no	reason	I	could
think	 of.	 Downstairs	 my
mother	 was	 singing.	 I
knocked	 on	 Amma’s	 door
and	 heard	 a	 whimper	 of
welcome.
She	sat	naked	on	the	floorin	 front	 of	 her	 huge
dollhouse,	 a	 thumb	 in	 her
mouth.	 The	 circles	 beneath
her	 eyes	 were	 almost	 purple,
and	 my	 mother	 had	 pasted
bandages	to	her	forehead	and
chest.	 Amma	 had	 wrapped
her	 favorite	 doll	 in	 tissue
paper,	dotted	all	over	with	red
Magic	 Marker,	 and	 propped
her	up	in	bed.
“What’d	 she	 do	 to	 you?”
she	 said	 sleepily,	 half
smiling.I	 turned	 around	 so	 she
could	see	my	crop	circle.
“And	 she	 gave	 me
something	 that	 made	 me	 feel
really	 groggy	 and	 sick,”	 I
said.
“Blue?”
I	nodded.
“Yeah,	 she	 likes	 that
one,”	Amma	mumbled.	“You
fall	asleep	all	hot	and	drooly,
and	 then	 she	 can	 bring	 her
friends	in	to	look	at	you.”
“She’s	 done	 this	 before?”My	body	went	cold	under	the
sweat.	I	was	right:	Something
horrible	was	about	to	happen.
She	 shrugged.	 “I	 don’t
mind.	Sometimes	I	don’t	take
it—just	 pretend.	 Then	 we’re
both	 happy.	 I	 play	 with	 my
dolls	 or	 I	 read,	 and	 when	 I
hear	 her	 coming	 I	 pretend	 to
be	asleep.”
“Amma?”	 I	 sat	 down	 on
the	 floor	 next	 to	 her	 and
stroked	 her	 hair.	 I	 needed	 to
be	gentle.	“Does	she	give	youpills	and	stuff	a	lot?”
“Only	 when	 I’m	 about	 to
be	sick.”
“What	happens	then?”
“Sometimes	 I	 get	 all	 hot
and	crazy	and	she	has	to	give
me	 cold	 baths.	 Sometimes	 I
need	to	throw	up.	Sometimes
I	get	all	shivery	and	weak	and
tired	and	I	just	want	to	sleep.”
It	 was	 happening	 again.
Just	 like	 Marian.	 I	 could	 feel
the	 bile	 in	 the	 back	 of	 my
throat,	the	tightening.	I	beganweeping	 again,	 stood	 up,	 sat
back	 down.	 My	 stomach	 was
churning.	 I	 put	 my	 head	 in
my	 hands.	 Amma	 and	 I	 were
sick	just	like	Marian.	It	had	to
be	 made	 that	 obvious	 to	 me
before	 I	 finally	 understood—
nearly	twenty	years	too	late.	I
wanted	to	scream	in	shame.
“Play	 dolls	 with	 me,
Camille.”	 She	 either	 didn’t
notice	or	ignored	my	tears.
“I	can’t,	Amma.	I	have	to
work.	Remember	to	be	asleepwhen	Momma	comes	back.”
	
I	dragged	on	clothes	over
my	aching	skin	and	looked	at
myself	in	the	mirror.	You	are
thinking	 crazy	 thoughts.	 You
are	being	un	reasonable.	 But
I’m	 not.	 My	 mother	 killed
Marian.	 My	 mother	 killed
those	little	girls.
	
I	 stumbled	 to	 the	 toilet
and	 threw	 up	 a	 stream	 of
salty,	 hot	 water,	 thebacksplashes	 from	 the	 toilet
freckling	 my	 cheeks	 as	 I
kneeled.	 When	 my	 stomach
unclenched,	 I	 realized	 I
wasn’t	alone.	My	mother	was
standing	behind	me.
“Poor	 sweetness,”	 she
murmured.	
I	
started,
scrambled	 away	 from	 her	 on
all	 fours.	 Propped	 myself
against	 the	 wall	 and	 looked
up	at	her.
“Why	 are	 you	 dressed,
darling?”	she	said.	“You	can’tgo	anywhere.”
“I	 need	 to	 go	 out.	 I	 need
to	 do	 some	 work.	 Fresh	 air
will	be	good.”
“Camille,	 get	 back	 in
bed.”	 Her	 voice	 was	 urgent
and	shrill.	She	marched	to	my
bed,	 pulled	 down	 the	 covers,
and	 patted	 it.	 “Come	 on
sweetness,	 you	 need	 to	 be
smart	about	your	health.”
I	 stumbled	 to	 my	 feet,
grabbed	my	car	keys	from	the
table,	and	darted	past	her.“Can’t,	 Momma;	 I	 won’t
be	gone	long.”
I	left	Amma	upstairs	with
her	 sick	 dolls	 and	 slammed
down	the	driveway	so	quickly
I	 dented	 my	 front	 bumper
where	 the	 hill	 abruptly
evened	 out	 at	 street	 level.	 A
fat	 woman	 pushing	 a	 stroller
shook	her	head	at	me.
	
I	started	driving	nowhere,
trying	 to	 assemble	 my
thoughts,	running	through	thefaces	 of	 people	 I	 knew	 in
Wind	Gap.	I	needed	someone
to	tell	me	plainly	I	was	wrong
about	 Adora,	 or	 else	 that	 I
was	 right.	 Someone	 who
knew	 Adora,	 who’d	 had	 a
grown-up’s	 view	 of	 my
childhood,	 who’d	 been	 here
while	I	was	away.	I	suddenly
thought	 of	 Jackie	 O’Neele
and	her	Juicy	Fruit	and	booze
and	 gossip.	 Her	 off-kilter
maternal	 warmth	 toward	 me
and	 the	 comment	 that	 nowsounded	 like	 a	 warning:	 So
much	 has	 gone	 wrong.	 I
needed	 Jackie,	 rejected	 by
Adora,	 completely	 without
filter,	a	woman	who’d	known
my	 mother	 her	 entire	 life.
Who	 very	 clearly	 wanted	 to
say	something.
Jackie’s	house	was	only	a
few	 minutes	 away,	 a	 modern
mansion	meant	to	look	like	an
antebellum	 plantation	 home.
A	 scrawny	 pale	 kid	 was
hunched	over	a	riding	mower,smoking	as	he	drove	back	and
forth	 in	 tight	 lines.	 His	 back
was	 spackled	 with	 bumpy,
angry	 zits	 so	 big	 they	 looked
like	 wounds.	 Another	 meth
boy.	Jackie	should	cut	out	the
middle	man	and	just	give	the
twenty	 bucks	 straight	 to	 the
dealer.
I	 knew	 the	 woman	 who
answered	the	door.	Geri	Shilt,
a	 Calhoon	 High	 girl	 just	 a
year	ahead	of	me.	She	wore	a
starchy	nurse’s	dress,	same	asGayla,	and	still	had	the	round,
pink	 mole	 on	 her	 cheek	 that
I’d	 always	 pitied	 her	 for.
Seeing	 Geri,	 such	 a
pedestrian	face	from	the	past,
almost	made	me	turn	around,
get	 in	 my	 car,	 and	 ignore	 all
my	 worries.	 Someone	 this
ordinary	 in	 my	 world	 made
me	 question	 what	 I	 was
thinking.	But	I	didn’t	leave.
“Hi	 Camille,	 what	 can	 I
do	 for	 you?”	 She	 seemed
utterly	 uninterested	 in	 why	 Iwas	 there,	 a	 distinct	 lack	 of
curiosity	 that	 separated	 her
from	 the	 other	 Wind	 Gap
women.	 She	 probably	 didn’t
have	any	girlfriends	to	gossip
to.
“Hey,	Geri,	I	didn’t	know
you	 worked	 for	 the
O’Neeles.”
“No	 reason	 you	 would,”
she	said	plainly.
Jackie’s	 three	 sons,	 born
in	a	row,	would	all	be	in	their
early	 twenties:	 twenty,twenty-one,	
twenty-two,
maybe.	 I	 remembered	 they
were	 beefy,	 thick-necked
boys	 who	 always	 wore
polyester	 coach	 shorts	 and
big	 gold	 Calhoon	 High	 rings
with	 flaming	 blue	 jewel
centers.	 They	 had	 Jackie’s
abnormally	 round	 eyes	 and
bright	
white	
overbites.
Jimmy,	 Jared,	 and	 Johnny.	 I
could	 hear	 at	 least	 two	 of
them	now,	home	from	school
for	the	summer,	throwing	thefootball	 in	 the	 backyard.
From	Geri’s	aggressively	dull
look,	 she	 must	 have	 decided
the	 best	 way	 to	 deal	 with
them	 was	 to	 stay	 out	 of	 their
way.
“I’m	 back	 here...”	 I
began.
“I	 know	 why	 you’re
here,”	 she	 said,	 neither
accusingly	 nor	 with	 any
generosity.	Just	a	statement.	I
was	 simply	 another	 obstacle
in	her	day.“My	 mom	 is	 friends	 with
Jackie	and	I	thought...”
“I	 know	 who	 Jackie’s
friends	are,	believe	me,”	Geri
said.
She	 didn’t	 seem	 inclined
to	 let	 me	 in.	 Instead	 she
looked	me	up	and	down,	then
out	to	the	car	behind	me.
“Jackie	 is	 friends	 with	 a
lot	 of	 your	 friends’	 moms,”
Geri	added.
“Mmmm.	 I	 don’t	 really
have	 many	 friends	 aroundhere	these	days.”	It	was	a	fact
I	was	proud	of,	but	I	said	the
words	 in	 a	 deliberately
disappointed	 manner.	 The
less	 she	 resented	 me,	 the
quicker	I’d	get	in	there,	and	I
felt	 an	 urgent	 need	 to	 speak
with	 Jackie	 before	 I	 talked
myself	out	of	it.	“In	fact,	even
when	 I	 lived	 here,	 I	 don’t
really	 think	 I	 had	 that	 many
friends.”
“Katie	 Lacey.	 Her	 mom
hangs	out	with	all	them.”Good	 old	 Katie	 Lacey,
who	 dragged	 me	 to	 the	 Pity
Party	 and	 turned	 on	 me.	 I
could	 picture	 her	 roaring
around	town	in	that	SUV,	her
pretty	 little	 girls	 perched	 in
back,	perfectly	dressed,	ready
to	 rule	 over	 the	 other
kindergartners.	 They’d	 learn
from	 Mom	 to	 be	 particularly
cruel	 to	 the	 ugly	 girls,	 poor
girls,	girls	who	wanted	to	just
be	 left	 alone.	 Too	 much	 to
ask.“Katie	Lacey	is	a	girl	I’m
ashamed	 of	 ever	 being
friendly	with.”
“Yeah,	 well,	 you	 were
okay,”	 Geri	 said.	 Just	 then	 I
remembered	 she’d	 had	 a
horse	named	Butter.	The	joke
was	 that	 of	 course	 even
Geri’s	pet	was	fattening.
“Not	 really.”	 I’d	 never
participated	 in	 direct	 acts	 of
cruelty,	 but	 I	 never	 stopped
them,	 either.	 I	 always	 stood
on	 the	 sidelines	 like	 a	 fretfulshadow	 and	 pretended	 to
laugh.
Geri	continued	to	stand	in
the	doorway,	stretching	at	the
cheap	watch	around	her	wrist,
tight	as	a	rubber	band,	clearly
lost	 in	 her	 own	 memories.
Bad	ones.
So	 why,	 then,	 would	 she
stay	 in	 Wind	 Gap?	 I’d	 run
across	 so	 many	 of	 the	 same
faces	 since	 I’d	 been	 back.
Girls	 I	 grew	 up	 with,	 who
never	had	the	energy	to	leave.It	 was	 a	 town	 that	 bred
complacency	 through	 cable
TV	 and	 a	 convenience	 store.
Those	 who	 remained	 here
were	still	just	as	segregated	as
before.	Petty,	pretty	girls	like
Katie	 Lacey	 who	 now	 lived,
predictably,	 in	 a	 rehabbed
Victorian	 a	 few	 blocks	 from
us,	 played	 at	 the	 same
Woodberry	 tennis	 club	 as
Adora,	 made	 the	 same
quarterly	 pilgrimage	 to	 St.
Louis	 for	 shopping.	 And	 theugly,	 victimized	 girls	 like
Geri	 Shilt	 were	 still	 stuck
cleaning	 up	 after	 the	 pretty
ones,	 heads	 lowered	 glumly,
waiting	for	more	abuse.	They
were	 women	 not	 strong
enough	 or	 smart	 enough	 to
leave.	 Women	 without
imagination.	 So	 they	 stayed
in	Wind	Gap	and	played	their
teenage	 lives	 on	 an	 endless
loop.	 And	 now	 I	 was	 stuck
with	 them,	 unable	 to	 pull
myself	out.“Let	me	tell	Jackie	you’re
here.”	Geri	went	the	long	way
to	 the	 back	 stairs—around
through	 the	 living	 room
rather	 than	 the	 glass-paneled
kitchen	that	would	expose	her
to	Jackie’s	boys.
The	 room	 I	 was	 ushered
into	 was	 obscenely	 white
with	glaring	splashes	of	color,
like	 a	 mischievous	 child	 had
been	 finger	 painting.	 Red
throw	 pillows,	 yellow-and-
blue	curtains,	a	glowing	greenvase	packed	with	ceramic	red
flowers.	 A	 ludicrous	 leering
black-and-white	 photo	 of
Jackie,	hair	overblown,	talons
curled	coyly	beneath	her	chin,
hung	 over	 the	 mantelpiece.
She	 was	 like	 an	 over-
groomed	 lapdog.	 Even	 in	 my
sickened	state	I	laughed.
“Darling	Camille!”	Jackie
crossed	 the	 room	 with	 arms
outstretched.	
She	
was
wearing	 a	 satin	 house	 robe
and	 diamond	 earrings	 likeblocks.	 “You’ve	 come	 to
visit.	 You	 look	 horrible,
sweetheart.	Geri,	get	us	some
Bloody	 Marys,	 stat!”	 She
howled,	 literally,	 at	 me,	 then
at	Geri.	I	guess	it	was	a	laugh.
Geri	 lingered	 in	 the	 doorway
until	Jackie	clapped	at	her.
“I’m	
serious,	
Geri.
Remember	to	salt	the	rim	this
time.”	She	turned	back	to	me.
“So	 hard	 to	 get	 good	 help
these	 days,”	 she	 muttered
earnestly,	 unaware	 no	 onereally	 says	 that	 who’s	 not	 on
TV.	 I’m	 sure	 Jackie	 watched
TV	 nonstop,	 drink	 in	 one
hand,	 remote	 control	 in	 the
other,	 curtains	 pulled	 as
morning	 talk	 shows	 yielded
to	 soaps,	 glided	 into	 court
TV,	 moved	 on	 to	 reruns,
sitcoms,	 crime	 dramas,	 and
late-night	 movies	 about
women	 who	 were	 raped,
stalked,	betrayed,	or	killed.
Geri	 brought	 in	 the
Bloodys	on	a	tray,	along	withcontainers	 of	 celery,	 pickles,
and	olives,	and,	as	instructed,
closed	 the	 drapes	 and	 left.
Jackie	 and	 I	 sat	 in	 the	 dim
light,	 in	 the	 freezing	 air-
conditioned	 white	 room,	 and
stared	 at	 each	 other	 a	 few
seconds.	
Then	
Jackie
swooped	down	and	pulled	out
the	drawer	of	the	coffee	table.
It	 held	 three	 bottles	 of	 nail
polish,	 a	 ratty	 Bible,	 and
more	 than	 half	 a	 dozen
orange	 prescription	 bottles.	 Ithought	 of	 Curry	 and	 his
clipped	rose	thorns.
“Painkiller?	 I	 got	 some
good	ones.”
“I	 should	 probably	 keep
some	of	my	wits	about	me,”	I
said,	not	quite	sure	if	she	was
serious.	 “Looks	 like	 you
could	 almost	 start	 your	 own
store	there.”
“Oh	 sure.	 I’m	 terribly
lucky.”	 I	 could	 smell	 her
anger	 mixed	 with	 tomato
juice.	 “OxyContin,	 Percocet,Percodan,	 whatever	 new	 pill
my	latest	doctor	has	stock	in.
But	 I	 got	 to	 admit,	 they’re
fun.”	She	poured	a	few	round
white	 tablets	 into	 her	 hand
and	shot	them	back,	smiled	at
me.
“What	 do	 you	 have?”	 I
asked,	 almost	 afraid	 of	 the
answer.
“That’s	 the	 best	 part,
sweetie.	 No	 one	 fucking
knows.	 Lupus	 says	 one,
arthritis	 says	 another,	 somesort	of	autoimmune	syndrome
says	 a	 third,	 it’s	 all	 in	 my
head	 says	 the	 fourth	 and
fifth.”
“What	do	you	think?”
“What	 do	 I	 think?”	 she
asked,	and	rolled	her	eyes.	“I
think	as	long	as	they	keep	the
meds	 coming,	 I	 probably
don’t	care	all	that	much.”	She
laughed	 again.	 “They’re
really	fun.”
Whether	 she	 was	 putting
on	a	brave	face	or	was	reallyaddicted,	I	couldn’t	tell.
“I’m	 sort	 of	 surprised
Adora	 hasn’t	 gotten	 herself
on	the	sick	track,”	she	leered.
“Figured	 once	 I	 did,	 she’d
have	 to	 up	 the	 stakes,	 right?
She	 wouldn’t	 have	 silly	 old
lupus,	 though.	 She’d	 find	 a
way	 to	 get...I	 don’t	 know,
brain	cancer.	Right?”
She	 took	 another	 sip	 of
the	Bloody	Mary,	got	a	slash
of	 red	 and	 salt	 across	 her
upper	 lip,	 which	 made	 herlook	 swollen.	 That	 second
swallow	 calmed	 her,	 and	 just
as	 she	 had	 at	 Natalie’s
funeral,	 she	 stared	 at	 me	 like
she	 was	 trying	 to	 memorize
my	face.
“Good	 God,	 it’s	 so	 weird
to	 see	 you	 grown	 up,”	 she
said,	 patting	 my	 knee.	 “Why
are	 you	 here,	 sweetheart?	 Is
everything	 okay	 at	 home?
Probably	not.	Is	it...is	it	your
momma?”
“No,	 nothing	 like	 that.”	 Ihated	being	so	obvious.
“Oh.”	
She	
looked
dismayed,	a	hand	fluttering	to
her	robe	like	something	out	of
a	 black-and-white	 movie.	 I’d
played	her	wrong,	forgot	that
down	here	it	was	encouraged
to	openly	crave	gossip.
“I	 mean,	 I’m	 sorry,	 I
wasn’t	being	frank	just	now.	I
do	 want	 to	 talk	 about	 my
mother.”
Jackie	
immediately
cheered.	 “Can’t	 quite	 figureher	 out,	 huh?	 Angel	 or	 devil
or	both,	right?”	Jackie	placed
a	green	satin	pillow	under	her
tiny	rump	and	aimed	her	feet
onto	 my	 lap.	 “Sweepea,	 will
you	 just	 rub	 a	 little?	 They’re
clean.”	 From	 under	 the	 sofa
she	 pulled	 a	 bag	 of	 mini–
candy	bars,	the	kind	you	give
out	 at	 Halloween,	 and	 placed
them	on	her	belly.	“Lord,	I’m
going	 to	 have	 to	 get	 rid	 of
these	 later,	 but	 they’ll	 taste
good	going	down.”I	 took	 advantage	 of	 this
happy	 moment.	 “Was	 my
mother	 always...the	 way	 she
is	 now?”	 I	 cringed	 at	 the
awkwardness	of	the	question,
but	 Jackie	 cackled	 once,	 like
a	witch.
“What’s	 that,	 Sweepea—
Beautiful?	
Charming?
Beloved?	Evil?”	She	wiggled
her	 toes	 as	 she	 unwrapped	 a
chocolate.	 “Rub.”	 I	 began
kneading	 her	 cold	 feet,	 the
soles	rough	like	a	turtle	shell.“Adora.	 Well,	 damn.	 Adora
was	rich	and	beautiful	and	her
crazy	 parents	 ran	 the	 town.
They	 brought	 that	 damn	 hog
farm	 to	 Wind	 Gap,	 gave	 us
hundreds	 of	 jobs—there	 was
a	walnut	plant	then,	too.	They
called	 the	 shots.	 Everyone
bootlicked	the	Preakers.”
“What	 was	 life	 for	 her
like...at	home?”
“Adora	
was...overly
mothered.	 Never	 saw	 your
grandma	Joya	smile	at	her	ortouch	her	in	a	loving	way,	but
she	 couldn’t	 keep	 her	 hands
off	 her.	 Always	 fixing	 the
hair,	 tugging	 at	 clothes,
and...oh,	 she	 did	 this	 thing.
Instead	 of	 licking	 her	 thumb
and	 rubbing	 at	 a	 smudge,
she’d	 lick	 Adora.	 Just	 grab
her	 head	 and	 lick	 it.	 When
Adora	peeled	from	a	sunburn
—we	all	did	back	then,	not	as
smart	 about	 SPF	 as	 your
generation—Joya	 would	 sit
next	to	your	momma,	strip	offher	shirt,	and	peel	the	skin	off
in	 long	 strips.	 Joya	 loved
that.”
“Jackie...”
“I	am	not	lying.	Having	to
watch	 your	 friend	 stripped
naked	 in	 front	 of	 you,	 and...
groomed.	 Needless	 to	 say,
your	momma	was	sick	all	the
time.	 She	 was	 always	 having
tubes	 and	 needles	 and	 such
stuck	in	her.”
“What	 was	 she	 sick
with?”“Little	 bit	 of	 everything.
Lot	 of	 it	 just	 the	 stress	 of
living	 with	 Joya.	 Those	 long
unpainted	 fingernails,	 like	 a
man’s.	 And	 long	 hair	 she	 let
go	silver,	down	her	back.”
“Where	
was	
my
grandfather	in	all	this?”
“Don’t	 know.	 Don’t	 even
remember	his	name.	Herbert?
Herman?	 He	 was	 never
around,	and	when	he	was,	he
was	 just	 quiet	 and...away.
You	 know	 the	 type.	 LikeAlan.”
She	 popped	 another
chocolate	 and	 wiggled	 her
toes	 in	 my	 hands.	 “You
know,	 having	 you	 should
have	 ruined	 your	 mother.”
Her	 tone	 was	 reproachful,	 as
if	 I’d	 failed	 a	 simple	 chore.
“Any	 other	 girl,	 got	 knocked
up	 before	 marriage,	 here	 in
Wind	 Gap	 way	 back	 when,
it’d	 be	 all	 over	 for	 her,”
Jackie	 continued.	 “But	 your
mother	 always	 had	 a	 way	 ofmaking	 people	 baby	 her.
People—not	 just	 boys,	 but
the	 girls,	 their	 mothers,	 the
teachers.”
“Why	is	that?”
“Sweet	
Camille,	
a
beautiful	 girl	 can	 get	 away
with	 anything	 if	 she	 plays
nice.	 You	 certainly	 must
know	 that.	 Think	 of	 all	 the
things	boys	have	done	for	you
over	 the	 years	 they	 never
would	 have	 done	 if	 you
hadn’t	 had	 that	 face.	 And	 ifthe	boys	are	nice,	the	girls	are
nice.	 Adora	 played	 that
pregnancy	 beautifully:	 proud
but	 a	 little	 broken,	 and	 very
secretive.	 Your	 daddy	 came
for	that	fateful	visit,	and	then
they	 never	 saw	 each	 other
again.	 Your	 momma	 never
spoke	 about	 it.	 You	 were	 all
hers	 from	 the	 beginning.
That’s	 what	 killed	 Joya.	 Her
daughter	
finally	
had
something	 in	 her	 that	 Joya
couldn’t	get	at.”“Did	 my	 mother	 stop
being	 sick	 once	 Joya	 was
gone?”
“She	 did	 okay	 for	 a
while,”	 Jackie	 said	 over	 her
glass.	 “But	 wasn’t	 that	 long
before	 Marian	 came	 along,
and	 she	 didn’t	 really	 have
time	to	be	sick	then.”
“Was	 my	 mother...”	 I
could	feel	a	sob	welling	up	in
my	 throat,	 so	 I	 swallowed	 it
with	 my	 watered-down
vodka.	 “Was	 my	 mother...anice	person?”
Jackie	 cackled	 again.
Popped	 a	 chocolate,	 the
nougat	 sticking	 to	 her	 teeth.
“That’s	 what	 you’re	 after?
Whether	 she	 was	 nice?”	 she
paused.	“What	do	you	think?”
she	added,	mocking	me.
Jackie	 dug	 into	 her
drawer	 again,	 unscrewed
three	pill	bottles,	took	a	tablet
from	each,	and	arranged	them
from	 largest	 to	 smallest	 on
the	back	of	her	left	hand.“I	don’t	know.	I’ve	never
been	close	with	her.”
“But	you’ve	been	close	to
her.	 Don’t	 play	 games	 with
me,	 Camille.	 That	 exhausts
me.	 If	 you	 thought	 your
momma	 was	 a	 nice	 person,
you	 wouldn’t	 be	 over	 here
with	 her	 best	 friend	 asking
whether	she’s	nice.”
Jackie	 took	 each	 pill,
largest	to	smallest,	smashed	it
into	 a	 chocolate,	 and
swallowed	 it.	 Wrapperslittered	 her	 chest,	 the	 smear
of	 red	 still	 covered	 her	 lip,
and	 a	 thick	 fudgy	 coating
clung	 to	 her	 teeth.	 Her	 feet
had	 begun	 to	 sweat	 in	 my
hands.
“I’m	sorry.	You’re	right,”
I	 said.	 “Just,	 do	 you	 think
she’s...sick?”
Jackie	
stopped	
her
chewing,	 put	 her	 hand	 on
mine,	 and	 took	 a	 sigh	 of	 a
breath.
“Let	 me	 say	 it	 aloud,because	 I’ve	 been	 thinking	 it
too	long,	and	thoughts	can	be
a	 little	 tricky	 for	 me—they
zip	 away	 from	 you,	 you
know.	 Like	 trying	 to	 catch
fish	 with	 your	 hands.”	 She
leaned	 up	 and	 squeezed	 my
arm.	 “Adora	 devours	 you,
and	 if	 you	 don’t	 let	 her,	 it’ll
be	 even	 worse	 for	 you.	 Look
it	 what’s	 happening	 to
Amma.	 Look	 at	 what
happened	to	Marian.”
Yes.	 Just	 below	 my	 leftbreast,	bundle	began	tingling.
“So	 you	 think?”	 I
prompted.	Say	it.
“I	 think	 she’s	 sick,	 and	 I
think	 what	 she	 has	 is
contagious,”	
Jackie
whispered,	 her	 shaky	 hands
making	 the	 ice	 in	 her	 glass
chime.	 “And	 I	 think	 it’s	 time
for	you	to	go,	Sweepea.”
“I’m	 sorry,	 I	 didn’t	 mean
to	overstay	my	welcome.”
“I	mean	leave	Wind	Gap.
It’s	not	safe	for	you	here.”Less	than	a	minute	later	I
closed	 the	 door	 on	 Jackie	 as
she	 stared	 at	 the	 photo	 of
herself	 leering	 back	 from	 the
mantelpiece.	
Chapter	Fourteen
I	 nearly	 tumbled	 down
Jackie’s	 steps,	 my	 legs	 were
so	wobbly.	Behind	my	back	I
could	 hear	 her	 boys	 chanting
the	 Calhoon	 football	 rally.	 I
drove	 around	 the	 corner,
parked	 under	 a	 copse	 of
mulberry	 treees,	 and	 rested
my	head	against	the	wheel.
Had	my	mother	truly	been
sick?	 And	 Marian?	 Ammaand	 me?	 Sometimes	 I	 think
illness	 sits	 inside	 every
woman,	 waiting	 for	 the	 right
moment	 to	 bloom.	 I	 have
known	 so	 many	 sick	 women
all	 my	 life.	 Women	 with
chronic	 pain,	 with	 ever-
gestating	 diseases.	 Women
with	 conditions.	 Men,	 sure,
they	 have	 bone	 snaps,	 they
have	 backaches,	 they	 have	 a
surgery	 or	 two,	 yank	 out	 a
tonsil,	 insert	 a	 shiny	 plastic
hip.	 Women	 get	 consumed.Not	 surprising,	 considering
the	 sheer	 amount	 of	 traffic	 a
woman’s	 body	 experiences.
Tampons	 and	 speculums.
Cocks,	 fingers,	 vibrators	 and
more,	between	the	legs,	from
behind,	 in	 the	 mouth.	 Men
love	 to	 put	 things	 inside
women,	
don’t	
they?
Cucumbers	 and	 bananas	 and
bottles,	 a	 string	 of	 pearls,	 a
Magic	 Marker,	 a	 fist.	 Once	 a
guy	 wanted	 to	 wedge	 a
Walkie-Talkie	inside	of	me.	Ideclined.
Sick	 and	 sicker	 and
sickest.	 What	 was	 real	 and
what	 was	 fake?	 Was	 Amma
really	 sick	 and	 needing	 my
mother’s	medicine,	or	was	the
medicine	 what	 was	 making
Amma	sick?	Did	her	blue	pill
make	me	vomit,	or	did	it	keep
me	from	getting	more	ill	than
I’d	have	been	without	it?
Would	 Marian	 be	 dead	 if
she	 hadn’t	 had	 Adora	 for	 a
mother?I	 knew	 I	 should	 call
Richard	but	couldn’t	think	of
anything	 to	 tell	 him.	 I’m
scared.	I’m	vindicated.	I	want
to	 die.	 I	 drove	 back	 past	 my
mother’s	house,	then	east	out
toward	 the	 hog	 farm,	 and
pulled	 up	 to	 Heelah’s,	 that
comforting,	
windowless
block	 of	 a	 bar	 where	 anyone
who	 recognized	 the	 boss’s
daughter	 would	 wisely	 leave
her	to	her	thoughts.
The	 place	 stank	 of	 pigblood	 and	 urine;	 even	 the
popcorn	 in	 bowls	 along	 the
bar	smelled	of	flesh.	A	couple
of	 men	 in	 baseball	 caps	 and
leather	 jackets,	 handlebar
mustaches	and	scowls,	looked
up,	then	back	down	into	their
beers.	 The	 bartender	 poured
me	 my	 bourbon	 without	 a
word.	 A	 Carole	 King	 song
droned	from	the	speakers.	On
my	 second	 round,	 the
bartender	 motioned	 behind
me	 and	 asked,	 “You	 lookin’for	him?”
John	 Keene	 sat	 slumped
over	a	drink	in	the	bar’s	only
booth,	 picking	 at	 the
splintered	 edge	 of	 the	 table.
His	 white	 skin	 was	 mottled
pink	with	liquor,	and	from	his
wet	 lips	 and	 the	 way	 he
smacked	 his	 tongue,	 I
guessed	 he’d	 vomited	 once
already.	 I	 grabbed	 my	 drink
and	sat	across	from	him,	said
nothing.	 He	 smiled	 at	 me,
reached	 his	 hand	 to	 mineacross	the	table.
“Hi	 Camille.	 How’re	 you
doing?	 You	 look	 so	 nice	 and
clean.”	 He	 looked	 around.
“It’s...it’s	so	dirty	here.”
“I’m	doing	okay,	I	guess,
John.	You	okay?”
“Oh	 sure,	 I’m	 great.	 My
sister’s	 murdered,	 I’m	 about
to	 be	 arrested,	 and	 my
girlfriend	 who’s	 stuck	 to	 me
like	glue	since	I	moved	to	this
rotten	 town	 is	 starting	 to
realize	 I’m	 not	 the	 prizeanymore.	 Not	 that	 I	 care	 that
much.	She’s	nice	but	not...”
“Not	
surprising,”	
I
offered.
“Yeah.	Yeah.	I	was	about
to	 break	 up	 with	 her	 before
Natalie.	Now	I	can’t.”
Such	 a	 move	 would	 be
dissected	 by	 the	 whole	 town
—Richard,	 too.	 What	 does	 it
mean?	How	does	it	prove	his
guilt?
“I	will	not	go	back	to	my
parents’	 house,”	 he	 muttered.“I	 will	 go	 to	 the	 fucking
woods	and	kill	myself	before
I	 go	 back	 to	 all	 of	 Natalie’s
things	staring	at	me.”
“I	don’t	blame	you.”
He	 picked	 up	 the	 salt
shaker,	 began	 twirling	 it
around	the	table.
“You’re	 the	 only	 person
who	understands,	I	think,”	he
said.	“What	it’s	like	to	lose	a
sister	 and	 be	 expected	 to	 just
deal.	Just	move	on.	Have	you
gotten	 over	 it?”	 He	 said	 thewords	 so	 bitterly	 I	 expected
his	tongue	to	turn	yellow.
“You’ll	never	get	over	it,”
I	 said.	 “It	 infects	 you.	 It
ruined	me.”	It	felt	good	to	say
it	out	loud.
“Why	 does	 everyone
think	 it’s	 so	 strange	 that	 I
should	 mourn	 Natalie?”	 John
toppled	 the	 shaker	 and	 it
clattered	 to	 the	 floor.	 The
bartender	 sent	 over	 a
disgruntled	 look.	 I	 picked	 it
up,	 set	 it	 on	 my	 side	 of	 thetable,	 threw	 a	 pinch	 of	 salt
over	 my	 shoulder	 for	 both	 of
us.
“I	 guess	 when	 you’re
young,	 people	 expect	 you	 to
accept	 things	 more	 easily,”	 I
said.	 “And	 you’re	 a	 guy.
Guys	 don’t	 have	 soft
feelings.”
He	 snorted.	 “My	 parents
got	 me	 this	 book	 on	 dealing
with	 death:	 Male	 in
Mourning.	 It	 said	 that
sometimes	 you	 need	 to	 dropout,	 to	 just	 deny.	 That	 denial
can	 be	 good	 for	 men.	 So	 I
tried	 to	 take	 an	 hour	 and
pretend	 like	 I	 didn’t	 care.
And	 for	 a	 little	 bit,	 I	 really
didn’t.	 I	 sat	 in	 my	 room	 at
Meredith’s	 and	 I	 thought
about...bullshit.	 I	 just	 stared
out	 the	 window	 at	 this	 little
square	 of	 blue	 sky	 and	 kept
saying,	 It’s	 okay,	 it’s	 okay,
it’s	 okay.	 Like	 I	 was	 a	 kid
again.	And	when	I	was	done,
I	 knew	 for	 sure	 nothingwould	 ever	 be	 okay	 again.
Even	 if	 they	 caught	 who	 did
it,	it	wouldn’t	be	okay.	I	don’t
know	 why	 everyone	 keeps
saying	 we’ll	 feel	 better	 once
someone’s	 arrested.	 Now	 it
looks	like	the	someone	who’s
going	 to	 be	 arrested	 is	 me.”
He	 laughed	 in	 a	 grunt	 and
shook	 his	 head.	 “It’s	 just
fucking	 insane.”	 And	 then,
abruptly:	 “You	 want	 another
drink?	Will	you	have	another
drink	with	me?”He	was	smashed,	swaying
heavily,	 but	 I	 would	 never
steer	 a	 fellow	 sufferer	 from
the	 relief	 of	 a	 blackout.
Sometimes	 that’s	 the	 most
logical	 route.	 I’ve	 always
believed	 clear-eyed	 sobriety
was	 for	 the	 harder	 hearted.	 I
had	a	shot	at	the	bar	to	catch
up,	 then	 came	 back	 with	 two
bourbons.	Mine	a	double.
“It’s	 like	 they	 picked	 the
two	 girls	 in	 Wind	 Gap	 who
had	 minds	 of	 their	 own	 andkilled	 them	 off,”	 John	 said.
He	 took	 a	 sip	 of	 bourbon.
“Do	you	think	your	sister	and
my	 sister	 would	 have	 been
friends?”
In	 that	 imaginary	 place
where	 they	 were	 both	 alive,
where	 Marian	 had	 never
aged.
“No,”	I	said,	and	laughed
suddenly.	He	laughed,	too.
“So	your	dead	sister	is	too
good	 for	 my	 dead	 sister?”	 he
blurted.	 We	 both	 laughedagain,	 and	 then	 quickly
soured	and	turned	back	to	our
drinks.	 I	 was	 already	 feeling
dazed.
“I	 didn’t	 kill	 Natalie,”	 he
whispered.
“I	know.”
He	 picked	 up	 my	 hand,
wrapped	it	around	his.
“Her	 fingernails	 were
painted.	 When	 they	 found
her.	 Someone	 painted	 her
fingernails,”	he	mumbled.
“Maybe	she	did.”“Natalie	 hated	 that	 kind
of	thing.	Barely	even	allowed
a	brush	through	her	hair.”
Silence	
for	
several
minutes.	 Carole	 King	 had
given	 way	 to	 Carly	 Simon.
Feminine	 folksy	 voices	 in	 a
bar	for	slaughterers.
“You’re	 so	 beautiful,”
John	said.
“So	are	you.”
	
John	 fumbled	 with	 his
keys	 in	 the	 parking	 lot,handed	 them	 to	 me	 easily
when	 I	 told	 him	 he	 was	 too
drunk	to	drive.	Not	that	I	was
much	 better.	 I	 steered	 him
blurrily	 back	 to	 Meredith’s
house,	 but	 he	 just	 shook	 his
head	 when	 we	 got	 close,
asked	 if	 I’d	 drive	 him	 to	 the
motel	 outside	 town	 lines.
Same	one	I’d	stayed	at	on	my
way	down	here,	a	little	refuge
where	 one	 could	 prepare	 for
Wind	Gap	and	its	weight.
We	 drove	 with	 thewindows	 down,	 warm	 night
air	blowing	in,	pasting	John’s
T-shirt	 to	 his	 chest,	 my	 long
sleeves	 flapping	 in	 the	 wind.
Aside	 from	 his	 thick	 head	 of
hair,	 he	 was	 so	 utterly	 bare.
Even	his	arms	sprouted	only	a
light	 down.	 He	 seemed
almost	 naked,	 in	 need	 of
cover.
I	paid	for	the	room,	No.	9,
because	 John	 had	 no	 credit
cards,	 and	 opened	 the	 door
for	 him,	 sat	 him	 on	 the	 bed,got	 him	 a	 glass	 of	 lukewarm
water	in	a	plastic	cup.	He	just
looked	at	his	feet	and	refused
to	take	it.
“John,	 you	 need	 to	 drink
some	water.”
He	 drained	 the	 cup	 in	 a
gulp	and	let	it	roll	off	the	side
of	the	bed.	Grabbed	my	hand.
I	 tried	 to	 pull	 away—more
instinct	 than	 anything—but
he	squeezed	harder.
“I	 saw	 this	 the	 other	 day,
too,”	 he	 said,	 his	 fingertracing	 part	 of	 the	 d	 in
wretched,	 just	 tucked	 under
my	 left	 shirtsleeve.	 He
reached	his	other	hand	up	and
stroked	 my	 face.	 “Can	 I
look?”
“No.”	I	tried	again	to	pull
away.
“Let	me	see,	Camille.”	He
held	on.
“No,	John.	No	one	sees.”
“I	do.”
He	 rolled	 my	 sleeve	 up,
squinted	 his	 eyes.	 Trying	 tounderstand	 the	 lines	 in	 my
skin.	 I	 don’t	 know	 why	 I	 let
him.	 He	 had	 a	 searching,
sweet	look	on	his	face.	I	was
weak	from	the	day.	And	I	was
so	 damned	 tired	 of	 hiding.
More	 than	 a	 decade	 devoted
to	 concealment,	 never	 an
interaction—a	 friend,	 a
source,	 the	 checkout	 girl	 at
the	 supermarket—in	 which	 I
wasn’t	 distracted	 anticipating
which	 scar	 was	 going	 to
reveal	 itself.	 Let	 John	 look.Please	 let	 him	 look.	 I	 didn’t
need	 to	 hide	 from	 someone
courting	 oblivion	 as	 ardently
as	I	was.
He	 rolled	 up	 the	 other
sleeve,	 and	 there	 sat	 my
exposed	 arms,	 so	 naked	 they
made	me	breathless.
“No	one’s	seen	this?”
I	shook	my	head.
“How	long	have	you	done
this,	Camille?”
“A	long	time.”
He	 stared	 at	 my	 arms,pushed	the	sleeves	up	farther.
Kissed	 me	 in	 the	 middle	 of
weary.
“This	 is	 how	 I	 feel,”	 he
said,	running	his	fingers	over
the	scars	until	I	got	a	chill	of
goosebumps.	 “Let	 me	 see	 it
all.”
He	 pulled	 my	 shirt	 over
my	 head	 as	 I	 sat	 like	 an
obedient	 child.	 Eased	 off	 my
shoes	and	socks,	pulled	down
my	 slacks.	 In	 my	 bra	 and
panties,	 I	 shivered	 in	 thefrosty	 room,	 the	 air
conditioner	 blasting	 a	 chill
over	me.	John	pulled	back	the
covers,	 motioned	 for	 me	 to
climb	 in,	 and	 I	 did,	 feeling
feverish	and	frozen	at	once.
He	 held	 up	 my	 arms,	 my
legs,	 turned	 me	 on	 my	 back.
He	 read	 me.	 Said	 the	 words
out	 loud,	 angry	 and
nonsensical	 both:	 oven,
queasy,	 castle.	 He	 took	 off
his	 own	 clothes,	 as	 if	 he
sensed	 an	 unevenness,	 threwthem	 in	 a	 ball	 on	 the	 floor,
and	 read	 more.	 Bun,	 spiteful,
tangle,	 brush.	 He	 unhooked
my	 bra	 in	 front	 with	 a	 quick
flick	 of	 his	 fingers,	 peeled	 it
off	 me.	 Blossom,	 dosage,
bottle,	salt.	 He	 was	 hard.	 He
put	his	mouth	on	my	nipples,
the	 first	 time	 since	 I	 began
cutting	 in	 earnest	 that	 I’d
allowed	 a	 man	 to	 do	 that.
Fourteen	years.
His	hands	ran	all	over	me,
and	 I	 let	 them:	 my	 back,	 mybreasts,	 my	 thighs,	 my
shoulders.	 His	 tongue	 in	 my
mouth,	 down	 my	 neck,	 over
my	nipples,	between	my	legs,
then	 back	 to	 my	 mouth.
Tasting	 myself	 on	 him.	 The
words	 stayed	 quiet.	 I	 felt
exorcised.
I	guided	him	into	me	and
came	 fast	 and	 hard	 and	 then
again.	I	could	feel	his	tears	on
my	 shoulders	 while	 he
shuddered	inside	me.	We	fell
asleep	 twisted	 around	 eachother	 (a	 leg	 jutting	 out	 here,
an	 arm	 behind	 a	 head	 there)
and	 a	 single	 word	 hummed
once:	 omen.	 Good	 or	 bad	 I
didn’t	 know.	 At	 the	 time	 I
chose	 to	 think	 good.	 Foolish
girl.
In	 the	 early	 morning,
dawn	 made	 the	 tree	 branches
glow	 like	 hundreds	 of	 tiny
hands	 outside	 the	 bedroom
window.	 I	 walked	 naked	 to
the	 sink	 to	 refill	 our	 cup	 of
water,	 both	 of	 us	 hungoverand	 thirsty,	 and	 the	 weak
sunlight	 hit	 my	 scars	 and	 the
words	 flickered	 to	 life	 again.
Remission	 ended.	 My	 upper
lip	 curled	 involuntarily	 in
repulsion	 at	 the	 sight	 of	 my
skin,	 and	 I	 wrapped	 a	 towel
around	 me	 before	 I	 got	 back
into	bed.
John	drank	a	sip	of	water,
cradled	 my	 head	 and	 poured
some	 into	 my	 mouth,	 then
gulped	 the	 remainder.	 His
fingers	 tugged	 at	 the	 towel.	 Iheld	 tight	 to	 it,	 hard	 as	 a
dishrag	 on	 my	 breasts,	 and
shook	my	head.
“What’s	
this?”	
he
whispered	into	my	ear.
“This	 is	 the	 unforgiving
light	 of	 morning,”	 I
whispered	 back.	 “Time	 to
drop	the	illusion.”
“What	illusion?”
“That	 anything	 can	 be
okay,”	 I	 said,	 and	 kissed	 his
cheek.
“Let’s	not	do	that	yet,”	hesaid,	 and	 wrapped	 his	 arms
around	 me.	 Those	 thin,
hairless	arms.	A	boy’s	arms.	I
told	myself	these	things,	but	I
felt	safe	and	good.	Pretty	and
clean.	 I	 put	 my	 face	 to	 his
neck	and	smelled	him:	liquor
and	 sharp	 shaving	 lotion,	 the
kind	that	squirts	out	ice	blue.
When	 I	 opened	 my	 eyes
again,	 I	 saw	 the	 red	 twirling
circles	 of	 a	 police	 siren
outside	the	window.
Bang	 bang	 bang.	 Thedoor	rattled	as	if	it	could	have
easily	broken	down.
“Camille	 Preaker.	 Chief
Vickery.	Open	up	if	you’re	in
there.”
We	 grabbed	 our	 scattered
clothes,	 John’s	 eyes	 as
startled	 as	 a	 bird’s.	 The
sounds	 of	 belt	 buckles	 and
shirt	 rustles	 that	 would	 give
us	 away	 outside.	 Frantic,
guilty	 noises.	 I	 threw	 the
sheets	 back	 on	 the	 bed,	 ran
fingers	 through	 my	 hair,	 andas	 John	 placed	 himself	 in	 an
awkwardly	 casual	 standing
position	 behind	 me,	 fingers
hooked	 through	 his	 belt
loops,	I	opened	the	door.
Richard.	
Well-pressed
white	shirt,	crisply	striped	tie,
a	 smile	 that	 dropped	 as	 soon
as	 he	 saw	 John.	 Vickery
beside	 him,	 rubbing	 his
mustache	 as	 if	 there	 were	 a
rash	 beneath	 it,	 eyes	 flitting
from	 me	 to	 John	 before	 he
turned	 and	 stared	 at	 Richardhead	on.
Richard	said	nothing,	just
glared	at	me,	crossed	his	arms
and	 inhaled	 deeply	 once.	 I’m
sure	the	room	smelled	of	sex.
“Well,	 looks	 like	 you’re
just	 fine,”	 he	 said.	 Forced	 a
smirk.	 I	 knew	 it	 was	 forced
because	 the	 skin	 above	 his
collar	was	as	red	as	an	angry
cartoon	 character’s.	 “How’re
you,	John?	You	good?”
“I’m	 fine,	 thanks,”	 John
said,	and	came	to	stand	at	myside.
“Miss	 Preaker,	 your
mother	 called	 us	 a	 few	 hours
ago	when	you	failed	to	come
home,”	 mumbled	 Vickery.
“Said	 you’d	 been	 a	 bit	 sick,
taken	 a	 tumble,	 something
like	’at.	She	was	real	worried.
Real	 worried.	 Plus	 with	 all
this	 ugliness	 going	 on,	 you
can’t	be	too	careful.	I	suppose
she’ll	 be	 glad	 to	 hear
you’re...here.”
The	 last	 part	 asked	 as	 aquestion	I	had	no	intention	of
answering.	Richard	I	owed	an
explanation.	Vickery	no.
“I	 can	 phone	 my	 mother
myself,	 thanks.	 I	 appreciate
you	looking	up	on	me.”
Richard	looked	at	his	feet,
bit	 his	 lip,	 the	 only	 time	 I’ve
ever	 seen	 him	 abashed.	 My
belly	turned,	oily	and	fearful.
He	exhaled	once,	a	long	hard
gust,	put	his	hand	on	his	hips,
stared	 at	 me,	 then	 at	 John.
Kids	caught	misbehaving.“C’mon	 John,	 we’ll	 take
you	home,”	Richard	said.
“Camille	can	take	me,	but
thanks,	Detective	Willis.”
“You	 of	 age,	 son?”
Vickery	asked.
“He’s	 eighteen,”	 Richard
said.
“Well	 fine	 then,	 you	 two
have	 a	 real	 nice	 day,”
Vickery	 said,	 hissed	 a	 laugh
in	 Richard’s	 direction,	 and
muttered	 “already	 had	 a	 nice
night,”	under	his	breath.“I’ll	 phone	 you	 later,
Richard,”	I	said.
He	 raised	 a	 hand,	 flicked
it	 at	 me	 as	 he	 turned	 back	 to
the	car.
John	 and	 I	 were	 mostly
silent	 on	 the	 ride	 to	 his
parents’,	where	he	was	going
to	try	to	sleep	in	the	basement
rec	 room	 for	 a	 bit.	 He
hummed	a	snatch	of	some	old
’50s	 bebop	 and	 tapped	 his
fingernails	 on	 the	 door
handle.“How	 bad	 do	 you	 think
that	was?”	he	finally	asked.
“For	you,	maybe	not	bad.
Shows	 you’re	 a	 good
American	 boy	 with	 healthy
interest	 in	 women	 and	 casual
sex.”
“That	 wasn’t	 casual.	 I
don’t	feel	casual	about	that	at
all.	Do	you?”
“No.	 That	 was	 the	 wrong
word.	 That	 was	 just	 the
opposite,”	 I	 said.	 “But	 I’m
more	than	a	decade	older	thanyou,	 and	 I’m	 covering	 the
crime	 that...it’s	 a	 conflict	 of
interest.	Better	reporters	have
been	fired	for	such	a	thing.”	I
was	 aware	 of	 the	 morning
sunlight	 on	 my	 face,	 the
wrinkles	 at	 the	 edges	 of	 my
eyes,	 the	 age	 that	 hung	 on
me.	 John’s	 face,	 despite	 a
night	 of	 drinking	 and	 very
little	sleep,	was	like	a	petal.
“Last	 night.	 You	 saved
me.	 That	 saved	 me.	 If	 you
hadn’t	 stayed	 with	 me,	 Iwould	 have	 done	 something
bad.	I	know	it,	Camille.”
“You	 made	 me	 feel	 very
safe,	 too,”	 I	 said,	 and	 meant
it,	 but	 the	 words	 came	 out	 in
the	 disingenuous	 singsong	 of
my	mother.
	
I	 dropped	 John	 off	 a
block	 from	 his	 parents’
house,	his	kiss	landing	on	my
jaw	 as	 I	 jerked	 away	 at	 the
last	second.	No	one	can	prove
anything	happened,	I	thoughtat	that	moment.
Drove	 back	 to	 Main
Street,	 parked	 in	 front	 of	 the
police	station.	One	streetlight
still	 glowed.	 5:47	 a.m.	 No
receptionist	on	call	yet	in	the
lobby,	so	I	rang	the	nightbell.
The	room	deodorizer	near	my
head	 hissed	 a	 lemon	 scent
right	on	my	shoulder.	I	hit	the
bell	 again,	 and	 Richard
appeared	 behind	 the	 slit	 of
glass	 in	 the	 heavy	 door
leading	 to	 the	 offices.	 Hestood	 staring	 at	 me	 a	 second,
and	 I	 was	 waiting	 for	 him	 to
turn	 his	 back	 to	 me	 again,
almost	 willing	 him	 to,	 but
then	 he	 opened	 the	 door	 and
entered	the	lobby.
“Where	 do	 you	 want	 to
begin,	 Camille?”	 He	 sat	 on
one	 of	 the	 overstuffed	 chairs
and	put	his	head	in	his	hands,
his	 tie	 drooping	 between	 his
legs.
“It	 wasn’t	 like	 it	 looked,
Richard,”	 I	 said.	 “I	 know	 itsounds	 cliché	 but	 it’s	 true.”
Deny	deny	deny.
“Camille,	 just	 forty-eight
hours	after	you	and	I	had	sex,
I	 find	 you	 in	 a	 motel	 room
with	 the	 chief	 subject	 in	 my
child-murder	 investigation.
Even	 if	 it’s	 not	 what	 it	 looks
like,	it’s	bad.”
“He	 did	 not	 do	 it,
Richard.	I	absolutely	know	he
didn’t	do	it.”
“Really?	Is	that	what	ya’ll
discussed	 when	 he	 had	 hisdick	in	you?”
Good,	 anger,	 I	 thought.
This	I	can	handle.	Better	than
head-in-the-hands	despair.
“Nothing	
like	
that
happened,	 Richard.	 I	 found
him	 at	 Heelah’s	 drunk,	 dead
drunk,	and	I	really	thought	he
might	 harm	 himself.	 I	 took
him	 to	 the	 motel	 because	 I
wanted	 to	 stay	 with	 him	 and
hear	 him	 out.	 I	 need	 him	 for
my	 story.	 And	 you	 know
what	 I	 learned?	 Yourinvestigation	 has	 ruined	 this
boy,	 Richard.	 And	 what’s
worse,	I	don’t	even	think	you
really	believe	he	did	it.”
Only	 the	 last	 sentence
was	entirely	true,	and	I	didn’t
realize	it	until	the	words	came
out	 of	 me.	 Richard	 was	 a
smart	 guy,	 a	 great	 cop,
extremely	 ambitious,	 on	 his
first	major	case	with	an	entire
outraged	
community
bellowing	 for	 an	 arrest,	 and
he	didn’t	have	a	break	yet.	Ifhe	 had	 more	 on	 John	 than	 a
wish,	 he’d	 have	 arrested	 him
days	ago.
“Camille,	 despite	 what
you	 think,	 you	 don’t	 know
everything	
about	
this
investigation.”
“Richard,	believe	me,	I’ve
never	 thought	 that	 I	 did.	 I’ve
never	 felt	 anything	 but	 the
most	useless	outsider.	You’ve
managed	to	fuck	me	and	still
remain	airtight.	No	leaks	with
you.”“Ah,	so	you’re	still	pissed
about	 that?	 I	 thought	 you
were	a	big	girl.”
Silence.	 A	 hiss	 of	 lemon.
I	 could	 vaguely	 hear	 the	 big
silver	 watch	 on	 Richard’s
wrist	ticking.
“Let	me	show	you	what	a
good	sport	I	can	be,”	I	said.	I
was	 back	 on	 autopilot,	 just
like	the	old	days:	desperate	to
submit	to	him,	make	him	feel
better,	 make	 him	 like	 me
again.	 For	 a	 few	 minutes	 lastnight,	 I’d	 felt	 so	 comforted,
and	 Richard’s	 appearing
outside	 that	 motel	 door	 had
smashed	what	was	left	of	the
lingering	 calm.	 I	 wanted	 it
back.
I	 lowered	 myself	 to	 my
knees,	 and	 began	 unzipping
his	pants.	For	a	second	he	put
his	 hand	 on	 the	 back	 of	 my
head.	 Then	 instead	 he
grabbed	 me	 roughly	 by	 the
shoulder.
“Camille,	Christ,	what	areyou	doing?”	He	realized	how
hard	 his	 grip	 was	 and
loosened	 it,	 pulled	 me	 to	 my
feet.
“I	 just	 want	 to	 make
things	okay	with	us.”	I	played
with	a	button	on	his	shirt	and
refused	to	meet	his	eyes.
“That	 won’t	 do	 it,
Camille,”	 he	 said.	 He	 kissed
me	 almost	 chastely	 on	 the
lips.	 “You	 need	 to	 know	 that
before	 we	 go	 any	 further.
You	 just	 need	 to	 know	 that,period.”
Then	 he	 asked	 me	 to
leave.
	
I	 chased	 sleep	 for	 a	 few
darting	 hours	 in	 the	 back	 of
my	 car.	 The	 equivalent	 of
reading	 a	 sign	 between	 the
cars	of	a	passing	train.	Woke
up	sticky	and	peevish.	Bought
a	toothbrush	kit	at	the	FaStop,
along	 with	 the	 strongest-
smelling	 lotion	 and	 hairspray
I	 could	 find.	 I	 brushed	 myteeth	 in	 a	 gas-station	 sink,
then	 rubbed	 the	 lotion	 into
my	 armpits	 and	 between	 my
legs,	 sprayed	 my	 hair	 stiff.
The	resulting	smell	was	sweat
and	 sex	 under	 a	 billowing
cloud	of	strawberry	and	aloe.
I	couldn’t	face	my	mother
at	 the	 house	 and	 crazily
thought	 I’d	 do	 work	 instead.
(As	 if	 I	 were	 still	 going	 to
write	 that	 story.	 As	 if	 it
weren’t	 all	 about	 to	 go	 to
hell.)	 With	 Geri	 Shilt’smention	of	Katie	Lacey	fresh
in	 my	 mind,	 I	 decided	 to	 go
back	 to	 her.	 She	 was	 a
mother’s	 aide	 at	 the	 grade
school,	 for	 both	 Natalie	 and
Ann’s	 classes.	 My	 own
mother	 had	 been	 a	 mother’s
aide,	a	coveted,	elite	position
in	the	school	that	only	women
who	 didn’t	 work	 could	 do:
swoop	 into	 classrooms	 twice
a	 week	 and	 help	 organize
arts,	 crafts,	 music,	 and,	 for
girls	 on	 Thursdays,	 sewing.At	 least	 in	 my	 day	 it’d	 been
sewing.	 By	 now	 it	 was
probably	 something	 more
gender	 neutral	 and	 modern.
Computer	usage	or	beginners’
microwaving.
Katie,	 like	 my	 mother,
lived	 at	 the	 top	 of	 a	 big	 hill.
The	 house’s	 slender	 staircase
cut	 into	 the	 grass	 and	 was
bordered	 with	 sunflowers.	 A
catalpa	 tree	 sat	 slim	 and
elegant	 as	 a	 finger	 on	 the
hilltop,	 the	 female	 match	 tothe	 burly	 shade	 oak	 on	 its
right.	 It	 was	 barely	 ten,	 but
Katie,	 slim	 and	 brown,	 was
already	sunning	herself	on	the
widow’s	 walk,	 a	 box	 fan
breezing	her.	Sun	without	the
heat.	 Now	 if	 she	 could	 only
figure	 out	 a	 tan	 without	 the
cancer.	 Or	 at	 least	 the
wrinkles.	She	saw	me	coming
up	 the	 stairs,	 an	 irritating
flicker	against	the	deep	green
of	 her	 lawn,	 and	 shaded	 her
eyes	 to	 make	 me	 out	 fromforty	feet	above.
“Who	is	that?”	she	called
out.	 Her	 hair,	 a	 natural
wheaty	blonde	in	high	school,
was	 now	 a	 brassy	 platinum
that	 sprung	 out	 of	 a	 ponytail
atop	her	head.
“Hi,	Katie.	It’s	Camille.”
“Ca-meeel!	 Oh	 my	 God,
I’m	coming	down.”
It	 was	 a	 more	 generous
greeting	 than	 I’d	 expected
from	 Katie,	 who	 I	 hadn’t
heard	 from	 again	 after	 thenight	 of	 Angie’s	 Pity	 Party.
Her	grudges	always	came	and
went	like	breezes.
She	 bounded	 to	 the	 door,
those	 bright	 blue	 eyes
glowing	 from	 her	 suntanned
face.	 Her	 arms	 were	 brown
and	 skinny	 as	 a	 child’s,
reminding	 me	 of	 the	 French
cigarillos	 Alan	 had	 taken	 to
smoking	 one	 winter.	 My
mother	 had	 blocked	 him	 off
into	 the	 basement,	 grandly
called	 it	 his	 smoking	 room.Alan	 soon	 dropped	 the
cigarillos	and	took	up	port.
Over	her	bikini	Katie	had
thrown	 a	 neon	 pink	 tank,	 the
kind	girls	picked	up	in	South
Padre	 in	 the	 late	 ’80s,
souvenirs	 from	 wet	 T-shirt
contests	 over	 Spring	 Break.
She	 wrapped	 her	 cocoa-
buttered	arms	around	me	and
led	me	inside.	No	A/C	in	this
old	house	either,	just	like	my
momma’s,	 she	 explained.
Although	 they	 did	 have	 oneroom	 unit	 in	 the	 master
bedroom.	The	kids,	I	guessed,
could	 sweat	 it	 out.	 Not	 that
they	 weren’t	 catered	 to.	 The
entire	east	wing	seemed	to	be
an	
indoor	
playground,
complete	 with	 a	 yellow
plastic	 house,	 a	 slide,	 a
designer	rocking	horse.	None
of	 it	 looked	 remotely	 played
with.	Big	colored	letters	lined
one	 wall:	 Mackenzie.	 Emma.
Photos	 of	 smiling	 blonde
girls,	 pug	 nosed	 and	 glassyeyed,	 pretty	 mouth	 breathers.
Never	 a	 close-up	 of	 a	 face,
but	always	framed	in	order	to
capture	 what	 they	 were
wearing.	 Pink	 overalls	 with
daisies,	 red	 dresses	 with
polka-dot	 bloomers,	 Easter
bonnets	and	Mary	Janes.	Cute
kids,	 really	 cute	 clothes.	 I’d
just	 created	 a	 tagline	 for
Wind	Gaps’	li’l	shoppers.
Katie	 Lacey	 Brucker
didn’t	seem	to	care	why	I	was
in	 her	 home	 this	 Fridaymorning.	 There	 was	 talk	 of	 a
celebrity	 tell-all	 she	 was
reading,	
and	
whether
childrens’	 beauty	 pageants
were	 forever	 stigmatized	 by
JonBenet.	 Mackenzie	 is	 just
dying	to	model.	Well	she’s	as
pretty	as	her	mother,	who	can
blame	 her?	 Why,	 Camille,
that’s	 sweet	 of	 you	 to	 say—I
never	 felt	 like	 you	 thought	 I
was	 pretty.	 Oh	 of	 course,
don’t	be	silly.	Would	you	like
a	 drink?	 Absolutely.	 Wedon’t	keep	liquor	in	the	home.
Of	 course,	 not	 what	 I	 meant
at	all.	Sweet	tea?	Sweet	tea	is
lovely,	 impossible	 to	 get	 in
Chicago,	 you	 really	 miss	 the
little	 regional	 goodies,	 you
should	 see	 how	 they	 do	 their
ham	 up	 there.	 So	 great	 to	 be
home.
Katie	 came	 back	 with	 a
crystal	 pitcher	 of	 sweet	 tea.
Curious,	since	from	the	living
room	 I	 saw	 her	 pull	 a	 big
gallon	 jug	 out	 of	 the	 icebox.A	 hit	 of	 smugness,	 followed
by	 a	 self-reminder	 that	 I
wasn’t	 being	 particularly
frank,	 either.	 In	 fact,	 I’d
cloaked	my	own	natural	state
with	 the	 thick	 scent	 of	 fake
plant.	 Not	 just	 aloe	 and
strawberry,	 but	 also	 the	 faint
strain	 of	 lemon	 air	 freshener
coming	from	my	shoulder.
“This	 tea	 is	 wonderful,
Katie.	 I	 swear	 I	 could	 drink
sweet	tea	with	every	meal.”
“How	 do	 they	 do	 theirham	 up	 there?”	 She	 tucked
her	 feet	 under	 her	 legs	 and
leaned	 in.	 It	 reminded	 me	 of
high	 school,	 that	 serious
stare,	as	if	she	were	trying	to
memorize	 the	 combination	 to
a	safe.
I	 don’t	 eat	 ham,	 hadn’t
since	I	was	a	kid	and	went	to
visit	 the	 family	 business.	 It
wasn’t	 even	 a	 slaughtering
day,	but	the	sight	kept	me	up
nights.	 Hundreds	 of	 those
animals	caged	so	tightly	theycouldn’t	even	turn	around,	the
sweet	 throaty	 scent	 of	 blood
and	 shit.	 A	 flash	 of	 Amma,
staring	intently	at	those	cages.
“Not	 enough	 brown
sugar.”
“Mmmhmm.	 Speaking	 of
which,	 can	 I	 make	 you	 a
sandwich	 or	 something?	 Got
ham	 from	 your	 momma’s
place,	 beef	 from	 the
Deacons’,	 chicken	 from
Coveys.	 And	 turkey	 from
Lean	Cuisine.”Katie	was	the	type	who’d
bustle	 around	 all	 day,	 clean
the	 kitchen	 tile	 with	 a
toothbrush,	 pull	 the	 lint	 from
the	 floorboards	 with	 a
toothpick	 before	 she	 spoke
much	
about	
anything
uncomfortable.	Sober	at	least.
Still,	I	maneuvered	her	to	talk
of	 Ann	 and	 Natalie,
guaranteed	 her	 anonymity,
and	 started	 up	 my	 tape
recorder.	 The	 girls	 were
sweet	 and	 cute	 and	 darling,the	
obligatory	
cheery
revisionism.	Then:
“We	did	have	an	incident
with	 Ann,	 on	 Sewing	 Day.”
Sewing	 Day,	 still	 around.
Kind	 of	 comforting,	 I
suppose.	 “She	 jabbed	 Natalie
Keene	 in	 the	 cheek	 with	 her
needle.	 I	 think	 she	 was
aiming	for	the	eye,	you	know,
like	 Natalie	 did	 to	 that	 little
girl	
back	
in	
Ohio.”
Philadelphia.	 “One	 minute
the	 two	 were	 sitting	 nice	 andquiet	 next	 to	 each	 other—
they	 weren’t	 friends,	 they
were	 in	 different	 grades,	 but
Sewing’s	open.	And	Ann	was
humming	 something	 to
herself	and	looking	just	like	a
little	 mother.	 And	 then	 it
happened.”
“How	hurt	was	Natalie?”
“Mmm,	 not	 too	 bad.	 Me
and	 Rae	 Whitescarver,	 she’s
the	 second-grade	 teacher
now.	 Used	 to	 be	 Rae	 Little,
few	years	below	us...and	notlittle.	At	least	not	then—she’s
dropped	 a	 few	 pounds.
Anyway,	 me	 and	 Rae	 pulled
Ann	 off	 and	 Natalie	 had	 this
needle	 sticking	 right	 out	 of
her	 cheek	 just	 an	 inch	 below
her	 eye.	 Didn’t	 cry	 or
nothing.	 Just	 wheezed	 in	 and
out	like	an	angry	horse.”
An	image	of	Ann	with	her
crooked	 hair,	 weaving	 the
needle	
through	
cloth,
remembering	 a	 story	 about
Natalie	 and	 her	 scissors,	 aviolence	 that	 made	 her	 so
different.	 And	 before	 she
thought	it	through,	the	needle
into	 flesh,	 easier	 than	 you’d
think,	 hitting	 bone	 in	 one
quick	 thrust.	 Natalie	 with	 the
metal	spearing	out	of	her,	like
a	tiny	silver	harpoon.
“Ann	 did	 it	 for	 no	 clear
reason?”
“One	 thing	 I	 learned
about	 those	 two,	 they	 didn’t
need	a	reason	to	strike	out.”
“Did	 other	 girls	 pick	 onthem?	 Were	 they	 under
stress?”
“Ha	 Ha!”	 It	 was	 a
genuinely	 surprised	 laugh,
but	 it	 came	 out	 in	 a	 perfect,
unlikely	 “Ha	 Ha!”	 Like	 a	 cat
looking	 at	 you	 and	 saying
“Meow.”
“Well,	 I	 wouldn’t	 say
school	 days	 were	 something
they	 looked	 forward	 to,”
Katie	 said.	 “But	 you	 should
ask	 your	 little	 sister	 about
that.”“I	 know	 you	 say	 Amma
bullied	them...”
“God	 help	 us	 when	 she
hits	high	school.”
I	 waited	 in	 silence	 for
Katie	 Lacey	 Brucker	 to	 gear
up	 and	 talk	 about	 my	 sister.
Bad	 news,	 I	 guessed.	 No
wonder	 she	 was	 so	 happy	 to
see	me.
“Remember	 how	 we	 ran
Calhoon?	 What	 we	 thought
was	 cool	 became	 cool,	 who
we	 didn’t	 like	 everyonehated?”	 She	 sounded	 fairy-
tale	 dreamy,	 as	 if	 she	 were
thinking	 of	 a	 land	 of	 ice
cream	 and	 bunnies.	 I	 only
nodded.	 I	 remember	 a
particularly	 cruel	 gesture	 on
my	 part:	 An	 overearnest	 girl
named	 LeeAnn,	 a	 leftover
friend	from	grade	school,	had
displayed	 too	 much	 concern
about	 my	 mental	 state,
suggested	 I	 might	 be
depressed.	 I	 snubbed	 her
pointedly	 one	 day	 when	 shecame	scurrying	over	to	speak
with	 me	 before	 school.	 I	 can
still	 remember	 her:	 books
bundled	 under	 her	 arms,	 that
awkward	 printed	 skirt,	 her
head	kept	a	bit	low	whenever
she	 addressed	 me.	 I	 turned
my	 back	 on	 her,	 blocked	 her
from	the	group	of	girls	I	was
with,	 made	 some	 joke	 about
her	 conservative	 church
clothes.	 The	 girls	 ran	 with	 it.
For	 the	 rest	 of	 the	 week,	 she
was	 pointedly	 taunted.	 Shespent	 the	 last	 two	 years	 of
high	school	hanging	out	with
teachers	during	lunch.	I	could
have	 stopped	 it	 with	 one
word,	 but	 I	 didn’t.	 I	 needed
her	to	stay	away.
“Your	 sister	 is	 like	 us
times	 three.	 And	 she	 has	 a
major	mean	streak.”
“Mean	streak	how?”
Katie	pulled	a	soft	pack	of
cigarettes	 from	 the	 endtable
drawer,	 lit	 one	 with	 a	 long
fireplace	 match.	 Still	 a	 secretsmoker.
“Oh,	 she	 and	 those	 three
girls,	 those	 little	 blonde
things	 with	 the	 tits	 already,
they	 rule	 the	 school,	 and
Amma	 rules	 them.	 Seriously,
it’s	 bad.	 Sometimes	 funny,
but	 mostly	 bad.	 They	 make
this	 fat	 girl	 get	 them	 lunch
every	 day,	 and	 before	 she
leaves,	 they	 make	 her	 eat
something	 without	 using	 her
hands,	 just	 dig	 her	 face	 in
there	 on	 the	 plate.”	 Shescrunched	 up	 her	 nose	 but
didn’t	
seem	
otherwise
bothered.	 “Another	 little	 girl
they	 cornered	 and	 made	 her
lift	up	her	shirt	and	show	the
boys.	 Because	 she	 was	 flat.
They	 made	 her	 say	 dirty
things	while	she	was	doing	it.
There’s	a	rumor	going	around
that	they	took	one	of	their	old
friends,	 girl	 named	 Ronna
Deel	 they’d	 fallen	 out	 with,
took	 her	 to	 a	 party,	 got	 her
drunk	 and...kind	 of	 gave	 heras	 a	 present	 to	 some	 of	 the
older	 boys.	 Stood	 guard
outside	 the	 room	 till	 they
were	done	with	her.”
“They’re	barely	thirteen,”
I	 said.	 I	 thought	 of	 what	 I’d
done	at	that	age.	For	the	first
time	 I	 realized	 how
offensively	young	it	was.
“These	 are	 precocious
little	 girls.	 We	 did	 some
pretty	wild	things	ourselves	at
not	 much	 older.”	 Katie’s
voice	 got	 huskier	 with	 hersmoke.	 She	 blew	 it	 up	 and
watched	 it	 hover	 blue	 above
us.
“We	 never	 did	 anything
that	cruel.”
“We	 came	 pretty	 damn
close,	 Camille.”	 You	 did,	 I
didn’t.	 We	 stared	 at	 each
other,	 privately	 cataloguing
our	power	plays.
“Anyway,	 Amma	 fucked
with	 Ann	 and	 Natalie	 a	 lot,”
Katie	 said.	 “It	 was	 nice	 your
mom	took	so	much	interest	inthem.”
“My	 mom	 tutored	 Ann,	 I
know.”
“Oh,	 she’d	 work	 with
them	 during	 mother’s	 aide,
have	 them	 over	 to	 your
house,	feed	them	after	school.
Sometimes	 she’d	 even	 come
by	 during	 recess	 and	 you
could	 see	 her	 outside	 the
fence,	 watching	 them	 on	 the
playground.”
A	 flash	 of	 my	 mother,
fingers	 wrapped	 between	 thefence	 wire,	 hungrily	 looking
in.	 A	 flash	 of	 my	 mother	 in
white,	glowing	white,	holding
Natalie	 with	 one	 arm,	 and	 a
finger	 up	 to	 her	 mouth	 to
hush	James	Capisi.
“Are	 we	 done?”	 Katie
asked.	 “I’m	 sort	 of	 tired	 of
talking	 about	 all	 this.”	 She
clicked	the	tape	recorder	off.
“So,	 I	 heard	 about	 you
and	 the	 cute	 cop,”	 Katie
smiled.	 A	 wisp	 of	 hair	 came
unhooked	 from	 her	 ponytail,and	 I	 could	 remember	 her,
head	 bent	 over	 her	 feet,
painting	 her	 toenails	 and
asking	 about	 me	 and	 one	 of
the	 basketball	 players	 she’d
wanted	for	herself.	I	tried	not
to	 wince	 at	 the	 mention	 of
Richard.
“Oh,	 rumors,	 rumors.”	 I
smiled.	 “Single	 guy,	 single
girl...my	life	isn’t	nearly	that
interesting.”
“John	 Keene	 might	 say
different.”	 She	 pluckedanother	 cigarette,	 lit	 it,
inhaled	 and	 exhaled	 while
fixing	 me	 with	 those	 china
blue	eyes.	No	smile	this	time.
I	 knew	 this	 could	 go	 two
ways.	 I	 could	 give	 her	 a	 few
tidbits,	make	her	happy.	If	the
story	 had	 already	 reached
Katie	at	ten,	the	rest	of	Wind
Gap	would	hear	by	noon.	Or	I
could	 deny,	 risk	 her	 anger,
lose	 her	 cooperation.	 I
already	had	the	interview,	and
I	 certainly	 didn’t	 care	 aboutstaying	in	her	good	graces.
“Ah.	 More	 rumors.
People	 need	 to	 get	 some
better	hobbies	around	here.”
“Really?	 Sounded	 pretty
typical	 to	 me.	 You	 were
always	open	to	a	good	time.”
I	 stood	 up,	 more	 than
ready	to	leave.	Katie	followed
me	out,	chewing	the	inside	of
her	cheek.
“Thanks	 for	 your	 time,
Katie.	 It	 was	 good	 seeing
you.”“You	 too,	 Camille.	 Enjoy
the	 rest	 of	 your	 stay	 here.”	 I
was	 out	 the	 door	 and	 on	 the
steps	when	she	called	back	to
me.
“Camille?”	 I	 turned
around,	 saw	 Katie	 with	 her
left	 leg	 bent	 inward	 like	 a
little	 girl’s,	 a	 gesture	 she	 had
even	 in	 high	 school.
“Friendly	 advice:	 Get	 home
and	 wash	 yourself.	 You
stink.”
	I	 did	 go	 home.	 My	 brain
was	stumbling	from	image	to
image	 of	 my	 mother,	 all
ominous.	 Omen.	 The	 word
beat	 again	 on	 my	 skin.	 Flash
of	thin,	wild-haired	Joya	with
the	 long	 nails,	 peeling	 skin
from	my	mother.	Flash	of	my
mother	 and	 her	 pills	 and
potions,	 sawing	 through	 my
hair.	 Flash	 of	 Marian,	 now
bones	 in	 a	 coffin,	 a	 white
satin	 ribbon	 wrapped	 around
dried	 blonde	 curls,	 like	 somebouquet	 gone	 stale.	 My
mother	 tending	 to	 those
violent	 little	 girls.	 Or	 trying
to.	 Natalie	 and	 Ann	 weren’t
likely	 to	 suffer	 much	 of	 that.
Adora	 hated	 little	 girls	 who
didn’t	 capitulate	 to	 her
peculiar	 strain	 of	 mothering.
Had	 she	 painted	 Natalie’s
fingernails	
before	
she
strangled	her?	After?
You’re	 crazy	 to	 think
what	 you’re	 thinking.	 You’re
crazy	to	not	think	it.	
Chapter	Fifteen
Three	 little	 pink	 bikes
were	 lined	 up	 on	 the	 porch,
bedecked	 with	 white	 wicker
baskets,	ribbons	streaming	off
the	 handlebars.	 I	 peeked	 in
one	of	the	baskets	and	saw	an
oversized	 stick	 of	 lipgloss
and	a	joint	in	a	sandwich	bag.
I	 slipped	 in	 a	 side	 door
and	padded	up	the	steps.	The
girls	 were	 in	 Amma’s	 roomgiggling	 loudly,	 shrieking
with	 delight.	 I	 opened	 the
door	without	knocking.	Rude,
but	I	couldn’t	bear	the	idea	of
that	 secret	 shuffle,	 that	 rush
to	 pose	 innocently	 for	 the
grown-up.	 The	 three	 blondes
were	 standing	 in	 a	 circle
around	 Amma,	 short	 shorts
and	 miniskirts	 bearing	 their
shaved	stick	legs.	Amma	was
on	the	floor	fiddling	with	her
dollhouse,	 a	 tube	 of	 super
glue	beside	her,	her	hair	piledon	 top	 of	 her	 head	 and	 tied
with	 a	 big	 blue	 ribbon.	 They
shrieked	 again	 when	 I	 said
hello,	 flashing	 outraged,
exhilarated	 smiles,	 like
startled	birds.
“Hey,	 Mille,”	 blurted
Amma,	 no	 longer	 bandaged,
but	 looking	 tweaked	 and
feverish.	 “We’re	 just	 playing
dolls.	 Don’t	 I	 have	 the	 most
beautiful	 dollhouse?”	 Her
voice	 was	 syrupy,	 modeled
after	 a	 child	 on	 a	 1950sfamily	 show.	 Hard	 to
reconcile	this	Amma	with	the
one	 who	 gave	 me	 drugs	 just
two	 nights	 before.	 My	 sister
who	 supposedly	 pimped	 out
her	 friends	 to	 older	 boys	 for
laughs.
“Yeah,	Camille,	don’t	you
love	 Amma’s	 dollhouse?”
echoed	the	brassy	blonde	in	a
husky	 voice.	 Jodes	 was	 the
only	 one	 not	 looking	 at	 me.
Instead	 she	 was	 staring	 into
the	 dollhouse	 as	 if	 she	 couldwill	herself	inside.
“You	feel	better,	Amma?”
“Oh,	 indeed	 I	 do,	 sister
dear,”	 she	 whinnied.	 “I	 hope
you	feel	well	also.”
The	 girls	 giggled	 again,
like	 a	 shudder.	 I	 shut	 the
door,	 annoyed	 with	 a	 game	 I
didn’t	 understand.	 “Maybe
you	 should	 take	 Jodes	 with
you,”	one	of	them	called	from
behind	the	closed	door.	Jodes
wasn’t	long	for	the	group.
I	ran	a	warm	bath	despitethe	 heat—even	 the	 porcelain
of	 the	 tub	 was	 rosy—and	 sat
in	it,	naked,	chin	on	my	knees
as	the	water	slowly	snaked	up
around	me.	The	room	smelled
of	 minty	 soap	 and	 the	 sweet,
spittoon	scent	of	female	sex.	I
was	raw	and	thoroughly	used
and	 it	 felt	 good.	 I	 closed	 my
eyes,	 slumped	 down	 into	 the
water	 and	 let	 it	 flow	 into	 my
ears.	 Alone.	 I	 wished	 I’d
carved	 that	 into	 my	 skin,
suddenly	 surprised	 that	 theword	 didn’t	 grace	 my	 body.
The	 bare	 circle	 of	 scalp
Adora	 had	 left	 me	 pricked
with	 goosebumps,	 as	 if
volunteering	
for	
the
assignment.	 My	 face	 cooled,
too,	and	I	opened	my	eyes	to
see	my	mother	hovering	over
the	 oval	 of	 the	 tub	 rim,	 her
long	 blonde	 hair	 encircling
her	face.
I	 lurched	 up,	 covered	 my
breasts,	splashing	some	water
on	 her	 pink	 ginghamsundress.
“Sweetheart,	 where	 did
you	 go?	 I	 was	 absolutely
frantic.	 I’d	 have	 come
looking	 for	 you	 myself	 but
Amma	had	a	bad	night.”
“What	 was	 wrong	 with
Amma?”
“Where	 were	 you	 last
night?”
“What	 was	 wrong	 with
Amma,	Mother?”
She	 reached	 for	 my	 face
and	 I	 flinched.	 She	 frownedand	reached	again,	patted	my
cheek,	smoothed	my	wet	hair
back.	 When	 she	 removed	 her
hand,	 she	 looked	 stunned	 at
the	wetness,	as	if	she’d	ruined
her	skin.
“I	 had	 to	 take	 care	 of
her,”	 she	 said	 simply.
Goosebumps	 blossomed	 on
my	 arms.	 “You	 cold,	 honey?
Your	nipples	are	hard.”
She	 had	 a	 glass	 of	 bluish
milk	 in	 her	 hand,	 which	 she
gave	to	me	silently.	Either	thedrink	 makes	 me	 sick	 and	 I
know	 I’m	 not	 insane,	 or	 it
doesn’t,	 and	 I	 know	 I’m	 a
hateful	 creature.	 I	 drank	 the
milk	 as	 my	 mother	 hummed
and	 ran	 her	 tongue	 over	 her
lower	lip,	a	gesture	so	fervent
it	was	nearly	obscene.
“You	 were	 never	 such	 a
good	 girl	 when	 you	 were
little,”	 she	 said.	 “You	 were
always	 so	 willful.	 Maybe
your	 spirit	 has	 gotten	 a	 bit
more	 broken.	 In	 a	 good	 way.A	necessary	way.”
She	 left	 and	 I	 waited	 in
the	 bathtub	 for	 an	 hour	 for
something	
to	
happen.
Stomach	
rumblings,
dizziness,	a	fever.	I	sat	as	still
as	I	do	on	an	airplane,	when	I
worry	 one	 rash	 movement
will	 send	 us	 into	 a	 tailspin.
Nothing.	 Amma	 was	 in	 my
bed	when	I	opened	the	door.
“You	 are	 so	 gross,”	 she
said,	arms	lazily	crossed	over
her.	 “I	 cannot	 believe	 youfucked	 a	 babykiller.	 You	 are
just	as	nasty	as	she	said.”
“Don’t	 listen	 to	 Momma,
Amma.	 She’s	 not	 a
trustworthy	 person.	 And
don’t...”	
What?	
Take
anything	 from	 her?	 Say	 it	 if
you	 think	 it,	 Camille.	 “Don’t
turn	 on	 me,	 Amma.	 We	 hurt
each	other	awfully	quickly	in
this	family.”
“Tell	 me	 about	 his	 dick,
Camille.	 Was	 it	 nice?”	 Her
voice	 was	 the	 same	 cloying,put-on	 she’d	 used	 with	 me
earlier,	 but	 she	 wasn’t
detached:	She	squirmed	under
my	sheets,	her	eyes	a	bit	wild,
face	flushed.
“Amma,	 I	 don’t	 want	 to
talk	about	this	with	you.”
“You	 weren’t	 too	 grown
up	 a	 few	 nights	 ago,	 sister.
Are	
we	
not	
friends
anymore?”
“Amma,	 I’ve	 got	 to	 lie
down	now.”
“Hard	 night,	 huh?	 Well,just	wait—everything’s	going
to	 get	 worse.”	 She	 kissed	 me
on	 the	 cheek	 and	 slid	 out	 of
the	 bed,	 clattered	 down	 the
hall	in	her	big	plastic	sandals.
Twenty	 minutes	 later	 the
vomiting	 began,	 wrenching,
sweaty	 upheavals	 in	 which	 I
pictured	
my	
stomach
contracting	 and	 bursting	 like
a	 heart	 attack.	 I	 sat	 on	 the
floor	 next	 to	 the	 toilet
between	 hacking,	 propped
against	the	wall	in	only	an	ill-fitting	T-shirt.	Outside	I	could
hear	 blue	 jays	 bickering.
Inside,	 my	 mother	 called
Gayla’s	 name.	 An	 hour	 later
and	 I	 was	 still	 vomiting,	 off-
green	nauseous	bile	that	came
out	 of	 me	 like	 syrup,	 slow
and	sinewy.
I	 pulled	 on	 some	 clothes
and	 brushed	 my	 teeth
gingerly—inserting	 too	 much
of	 the	 toothbrush	 in	 my
mouth	made	me	start	gagging
again.Alan	 was	 sitting	 on	 the
front	 porch	 reading	 a	 large,
leather-bound	 book	 entitled
only	Horses.	A	bowl	made	of
bumpy	 orange	 carnival	 glass
perched	on	the	armrest	of	his
rocking	 chair,	 a	 lump	 of
green	 pudding	 at	 its	 center.
He	 was	 in	 a	 blue	 seersucker
suit,	 a	 Panama	 hat	 atop	 his
head.	 He	 was	 serene	 as	 a
pond.
“Your	 mother	 know
you’re	leaving?”“I’ll	be	back	soon.”
“You’ve	 done	 much
better	 with	 her	 lately,
Camille,	 and	 for	 that	 I	 thank
you.	 She	 seems	 quite
improved.	 Even	 her	 dealings
with...Amma	 are	 smoother.”
He	 always	 seemed	 to	 pause
before	 his	 own	 daughter’s
name,	 as	 if	 it	 had	 a	 slightly
dirty	connotation.
“Good,	Alan,	good.”
“I	 hope	 you’re	 feeling
better	 about	 yourself	 too,Camille.	 That’s	 an	 important
thing,	 liking	 oneself.	 A	 good
attitude	 infects	 just	 as	 easily
as	a	bad	one.”
“Enjoy	the	horses.”
“I	always	do.”
The	 drive	 to	 Woodberry
was	punctuated	with	lurching
twists	 into	 the	 curb	 where	 I
threw	up	more	bile	and	a	little
blood.	 Three	 stops,	 one	 in
which	 I	 vomited	 down	 the
side	 of	 the	 car,	 unable	 to	 get
the	 door	 open	 fast	 enough.	 Iused	 my	 old	 warm	 cup	 of
strawberry	 pop	 and	 vodka	 to
wash	it	off.
	
St.	 Joseph’s	 Hospital	 in
Woodberry	 was	 a	 huge	 cube
of	 golden	 brick,	 cross-
sectioned	 with	 amber-shaded
windows.	 Marian	 had	 called
it	the	waffle.	It	was	a	mellow
place	for	the	most	part:	If	you
lived	 farther	 west,	 you	 went
to	 Poplar	 Bluff	 for	 your
health;	 farther	 north,	 to	 CapeGirardeau.	 You	 only	 went	 to
Woodberry	 if	 you	 were
trapped	 in	 the	 Missouri	 boot
heel.
A	 big	 woman,	 her	 bust
comically	round,	was	sending
off	 Do	 Not	 Disturb	 signals
from	 behind	 the	 Information
desk.	I	stood	and	waited.	She
pretended	 to	 be	 intently
reading.	 I	 stood	 closer.	 She
trailed	 an	 index	 finger	 along
each	line	of	her	magazine	and
continued	to	read.“Excuse	 me,”	 I	 said,	 my
tone	 a	 mix	 of	 petulance	 and
patronizing	 that	 even	 I
disliked.
She	 had	 a	 mustache	 and
yellowed	 fingertips	 from
smoking,	matching	the	brown
canines	 that	 peeked	 out	 from
beneath	 her	 upper	 lip.	 The
face	 you	 give	 the	 world	 tells
the	 world	 how	 to	 treat	 you,
my	 mother	 used	 to	 say
whenever	 I	 resisted	 her
grooming.	This	woman	couldnot	be	treated	well.
“I	 need	 to	 track	 down
some	medical	records.”
“Put	 a	 request	 in	 with
your	doctor.”
“My	sister’s.”
“Have	your	sister	put	in	a
request	with	her	doctor.”	She
flipped	 the	 page	 of	 her
magazine.
“My	sister	is	dead.”	There
were	 gentler	 ways	 of	 putting
this,	but	I	wanted	the	woman
to	 snap	 to.	 Even	 still,	 herattention	was	grudging.
“Ah.	 Sorry	 for	 your	 loss.
She	die	here?”	I	nodded.
“Dead	 on	 Arrival.	 She
had	 a	 lot	 of	 emergency
treatment	here	and	her	doctor
was	based	here.”
“What	 was	 the	 date	 of
death?”
“May	1,	1988.”
“Jesus.	 That’s	 a	 pace
back.	 Hope	 you’re	 a	 patient
woman.”
	Four	hours	later,	after	two
screaming	 matches	 with
disinterested	
nurses,	
a
desperate	 flirtation	 with	 a
pale,	
fuzzy-faced
administrator,	 and	 three	 trips
to	 the	 bathroom	 to	 vomit,
Marian’s	 files	 were	 flopped
on	my	lap.
There	 was	 one	 for	 each
year	of	her	life,	progressively
thicker.	 Half	 the	 doctors’
scratches	
I	
couldn’t
understand.	 Many	 involvedtests	 ordered	 and	 completed,
never	to	any	use.	Brain	scans
and	 heart	 scans.	 A	 procedure
involving	 a	 camera	 threaded
down	 Marian’s	 throat	 to
examine	 her	 stomach	 as	 it
was	 filled	 with	 radiant	 dye.
Heart-apnea	
monitors.
Possible	 diagnoses:	 diabetes,
heart	 murmur,	 acid	 reflux,
liver	 disease,	 pulmonary
hypertension,	
depression,
Crohn’s	disease,	lupus.	Then,
a	 feminine,	 pink	 sheet	 oflined	 stationery.	 Stapled	 to	 a
report	 documenting	 Marian’s
weeklong	hospital	stay	for	the
stomach	
tests.	
Proper,
rounded	 cursive,	 but	 angry—
the	 pen	 had	 indented	 each
word	deeply	into	the	paper.	It
read:
I	 am	 a	 nurse	 who
has	 attended	 Marian
Crellin	for	her	tests	this
week,	as	well	as	several
previous	
in-patient
stays.	 I	 am	 of	 the	 verystrong	 [“very	 strong”
underlined	
twice]
opinion	 that	 this	 child
is	 not	 sick	 at	 all.	 I
believe	 were	 it	 not	 for
her	 Mother,	 she	 would
be	 perfectly	 healthy.
The	child	exhibits	signs
of	illness	after	spending
time	 alone	 with	 the
Mother,	 even	 on	 days
when	 she	 has	 felt	 well
up	until	maternal	visits.
Mother	 shows	 nointerest	 in	 Marian
when	 she	 is	 well,	 in
fact,	 seems	 to	 punish
her.	Mother	holds	child
only	when	she	is	sick	or
crying.	 I	 and	 several
other	 nurses,	 who	 for
political	
reasons
choose	not	to	sign	their
names	to	my	statement,
believe	 strongly	 the
child,	 as	 well	 as	 her
sister,	
should	
be
removed	from	the	homefor	further	observation.
Beverly	Van	Lumm
Righteous	 indignation.
We	 could	 have	 used	 more	 of
that.	 I	 pictured	 Beverly	 Van
Lumm,	 busty	 and	 tight
lipped,	 hair	 gathered	 in	 a
determined	 bun,	 scrawling
out	the	letter	in	the	next	room
after	 she	 was	 forced	 to	 leave
limp	 Marian	 in	 my	 mother’s
arms,	 only	 a	 matter	 of	 time
until	 Adora	 cried	 out	 for
nursing	attention.Within	 an	 hour	 I	 had
tracked	the	nurse	down	in	the
pediatric	 ward,	 which	 was
actually	 just	 a	 big	 room
holding	 four	 beds,	 only	 two
of	them	in	use.	One	little	girl
was	reading	placidly,	the	little
boy	 next	 to	 her	 was	 sleeping
upright,	 his	 neck	 held	 in	 a
metal	 brace	 that	 seemed	 to
screw	right	into	his	spine.
Beverly	 Van	 Lumm	 was
not	 a	 bit	 like	 I	 pictured.
Maybe	 late	 fifties,	 she	 wastiny,	 her	 silver	 hair	 cropped
tight	 to	 her	 head.	 She	 wore
flowered	 nursing	 pants	 and	 a
bright	 blue	 jacket,	 a	 pen
propped	 behind	 her	 ear.
When	 I	 introduced	 myself,
she	 seemed	 to	 immediately
remember	 me,	 and	 appeared
none	too	surprised	I’d	finally
shown	up.
“It’s	 so	 nice	 to	 meet	 you
again	 after	 all	 these	 years,
although	
I	
hate	
the
circumstances,”	 she	 said	 in	 awarm,	
deep	
voice.
“Sometimes	 I	 daydream	 that
Marian	herself	comes	in	here,
all	 grown	 up,	 maybe	 with	 a
baby	 or	 two.	 Daydreams	 can
be	dangerous.”
“I	 came	 because	 I	 read
your	note.”
She	 snorted,	 capped	 her
pen.
“Bully	 lot	 of	 good	 that
did.	If	I	hadn’t	been	so	young
and	 nervous	 and	 awestruck
by	 the	 great	 docteurs	 aroundhere,	I	would	have	done	more
than	 write	 a	 note.	 ’Course
back	 in	 that	 time,	 accusing
mothers	 of	 such	 a	 thing	 was
almost	unheard	of.	Nearly	got
me	 fired.	 You	 never	 really
want	 to	 believe	 such	 a	 thing.
Like	 something	 out	 of
Brothers	Grimm,	MBP.”
“MBP?”
“Munchausen	 by	 Proxy.
The	 caregiver,	 usually	 the
mother,	 almost	 always	 the
mother,	makes	her	child	ill	toget	 attention	 for	 herself.	 You
got	 Munchausen,	 you	 make
yourself	 sick	 to	 get	 attention.
You	 got	 MBP,	 you	 make
your	 child	 sick	 to	 show	 what
a	 kind,	 doting	 mommy	 you
are.	 Brothers	 Grimm,	 see
what	I	mean?	Like	something
a	 wicked	 fairy	 queen	 would
do.	I’m	surprised	you	haven’t
heard	of	it.”
“It	 sounds	 familiar,”	 I
said.
“It’s	 becoming	 quite	 awell-known	 disease.	 Popular.
People	love	new	and	creepy.	I
remember	 when	 anorexia	 hit
in	 the	 eighties.	 The	 more	 TV
movies	 on	 it,	 the	 more	 girls
starved	 themselves.	 You
always	 seemed	 okay,	 though.
I’m	glad.”
“I’m	okay,	mostly.	I	have
another	 sister,	 a	 girl	 born
after	Marian,	I	worry	about.”
“You	 should.	 Dealing
with	 an	 MBP	 mom—it
doesn’t	pay	to	be	the	favorite.You	 were	 lucky	 your	 mother
didn’t	take	more	of	an	interest
in	you.”
A	 man	 in	 bright	 green
scrubs	 zipped	 down	 the
hallway	 in	 a	 wheelchair,
followed	 by	 two	 fat	 laughing
guys,	similarly	outfitted.
“Med	 students,”	 Beverly
said,	rolled	her	eyes.
“Did	 any	 doctors	 ever
follow	up	on	your	report?”
“I	 called	 it	 a	 report,	 they
saw	 it	 as	 some	 childless,jealous	nurse’s	pettiness.	Like
I	 said,	 different	 time.	 Nurses
get	a	leetle	more	respect	now.
Just	 a	 leetle.	 And	 to	 be	 fair,
Camille,	 I	 didn’t	 push	 it.	 I
was	 just	 off	 a	 divorce,	 I
needed	 to	 keep	 my	 job,	 and
bottom	 line	 was,	 I	 wanted
someone	 to	 tell	 me	 I	 was
wrong.	 You	 need	 to	 believe
you’re	 wrong.	 When	 Marian
died,	 I	 drank	 for	 three	 days.
She	 was	 buried	 before	 I
hinted	 around	 again,	 askedthe	 head	 of	 pediatrics	 if	 he’d
seen	 my	 note.	 I	 was	 told	 to
take	 the	 week	 off.	 I	 was	 one
of	those	hysterical	women.”
My	 eyes	 were	 suddenly
stinging	 and	 wet,	 and	 she
took	my	hand.
“I’m	sorry,	Camille.”
“God,	 I’m	 so	 angry.”
Tears	 spilled	 down	 my
cheeks	 and	 I	 rubbed	 them
away	 with	 the	 back	 of	 my
hand	until	Beverly	gave	me	a
tissue	 pack.	 “That	 it	 everhappened.	 That	 it	 took	 this
long	for	me	to	figure	it	out.”
“Well,	 sweetheart,	 she’s
your	 mother.	 I	 can’t	 imagine
what	it	must	be	like	for	you	to
come	to	grips	with	it.	At	least
it	 looks	 like	 justice	 will	 be
served	 now.	 How	 long	 has
the	 detective	 been	 on	 the
case?”
“Detective?”
“Willis,	 right?	 Good-
looking	 kid,	 sharp.	 He
Xeroxed	every	single	page	inMarian’s	 files,	 quizzed	 me
until	 my	 fillings	 hurt.	 Didn’t
tell	 me	 there	 was	 another
little	 girl	 involved.	 He	 told
me	 you	 were	 okay,	 though.	 I
think	he	has	a	crush	on	you—
he	 got	 all	 squirmy	 and
bashful	 when	 he	 mentioned
you.”
I	 stopped	 crying,	 wadded
up	 the	 tissues,	 and	 tossed
them	 in	 the	 trash	 next	 to	 the
reading	girl.	She	glanced	into
the	basket	curiously,	as	if	themail	 had	 just	 come	 in.	 I	 said
my	 thanks	 to	 Beverly	 and
made	 my	 way	 out,	 feeling
wild	and	in	need	of	blue	sky.
Beverly	 caught	 up	 to	 me
at	 the	 elevator,	 took	 both	 my
hands	 in	 hers.	 “Get	 your
sister	 out	 of	 that	 home,
Camille.	She’s	not	safe.”
	
Between	 Woodberry	 and
Wind	Gap	was	a	biker	bar	off
exit	 5,	 a	 place	 that	 sold	 six-
packs	 to	 go	 with	 no	 call	 forID.	 I’d	 gone	 there	 a	 lot	 in
high	 school.	 Next	 to	 the
dartboard	 was	 a	 pay	 phone.	 I
grabbed	a	handful	of	quarters
and	 phoned	 Curry.	 Eileen
picked	up,	as	usual,	that	voice
soft	 and	 steady	 as	 a	 hill.	 I
started	 sobbing	 before	 I	 got
more	than	my	name	out.
“Camille,	
sweetheart,
what	is	it?	Are	you	okay?	Of
course	 you’re	 not	 okay.	 Oh,
I’m	 so	 sorry.	 I	 told	 Frank	 to
get	you	out	of	there	after	yourlast	call.	What	is	it?”
I	 kept	 sobbing,	 couldn’t
even	think	what	to	say.	A	dart
hit	 the	 board	 with	 a	 solid
thunk.
“You	
aren’t...hurting
yourself	 again?	 Camille?
Sweetheart,	 you’re	 scaring
me.”
“My	 mother...”	 I	 said,
before	collapsing	again.	I	was
heaving	 with	 sobs,	 purging
from	deep	in	my	belly,	nearly
bent	over.“Your	 mother?	 Is	 she	 all
right?”
“Noooo.”	A	long	wail	like
a	 child.	 A	 hand	 over	 the
phone	 and	 Eileen’s	 urgent
murmur	of	Frank’s	name,	the
words	
something’s
happened...horrible,	a	silence
of	 two	 seconds	 and	 the	 crash
of	 glass.	 Curry	 got	 up	 from
the	 table	 too	 quickly,	 his
tumbler	of	whiskey	wobbling
to	the	floor.	Just	a	guess.
“Camille,	 talk	 to	 me,what’s	wrong.”	Curry’s	voice
was	 gruff	 and	 startling	 like
hands	 on	 both	 my	 arms
giving	me	a	shake.
“I	 know	 who	 did	 it,
Curry,”	I	hissed.	“I	know	it.”
“Well,	that’s	no	reason	to
cry,	 Cubby.	 The	 police	 made
an	arrest?”
“Not	yet.	I	know	who	did
it.”	Thunk	on	the	dartboard.
“Who?	 Camille,	 talk	 to
me.”
I	pressed	the	phone	to	mymouth	 and	 whispered,	 “My
mother.”
“Who?	Camille,	you	have
to	 speak	 up.	 Are	 you	 at	 a
bar?”
“My	 mother	 did	 it,”	 I
yelped	 into	 the	 phone,	 the
words	 coming	 out	 like	 a
splatter.
Silence	 for	 too	 long.
“Camille,	you	are	under	a	lot
of	 stress,	 and	 I	 was	 very
wrong	 to	 send	 you	 down
there	 so	 soon	 after...Now,	 Iwant	you	to	go	to	the	nearest
airport	 and	 fly	 back	 here.
Don’t	 get	 your	 clothes,	 just
leave	 your	 car	 and	 come
home	 here.	 We’ll	 deal	 with
all	that	stuff	later.	Charge	the
ticket,	I’ll	pay	you	back	when
you	 get	 home.	 But	 you	 need
to	come	home	now.”
Home	home	home,	like	he
was	trying	to	hypnotize	me.
“I’ll	 never	 have	 a	 home,”
I	 whimpered,	 began	 sobbing
again.	“I	have	to	go	take	careof	 this,	 Curry.”	 I	 hung	 up	 as
he	was	ordering	me	not	to.
	
Richard	I	tracked	down	at
Gritty’s	 having	 a	 late	 supper.
He	 was	 looking	 at	 clippings
from	 a	 Philadelphia	 paper
about	 Natalie’s	 scissors
attack.	He	nodded	grudgingly
at	 me	 as	 I	 sat	 down	 opposite
him,	 looked	 down	 at	 his
greasy	cheese	grits,	then	back
up	to	study	my	swollen	face.
“You	okay?”“I	think	my	mother	killed
Marian,	and	I	think	she	killed
Ann	and	Natalie.	And	I	know
you	 think	 that,	 too.	 I	 just	 got
back	 from	 Woodberry,	 you
fuck.”
The	 sorrow	 had	 turned	 to
outrage	 somewhere	 between
exits	5	and	2.	“I	can’t	believe
that	 all	 the	 while	 you	 were
making	 time	 with	 me,	 you
were	 just	 trying	 to	 get
information	about	my	mother.
What	 kind	 of	 sick	 fuck	 areyou?”	 I	 was	 shaking,	 the
words	 stuttering	 out	 of	 my
mouth.
Richard	 took	 a	 ten	 out	 of
his	wallet,	tucked	it	under	the
plate,	 walked	 to	 my	 side	 of
the	 table,	 and	 took	 my	 arm.
“Come	 with	 me	 outside,
Camille.	This	isn’t	the	place.”
He	 walked	 me	 through	 the
doors,	 to	 the	 passenger	 side
of	 the	 car,	 his	 arm	 still	 on
mine,	and	put	me	inside.
He	drove	us	in	silence	upthe	 bluff,	 his	 hand	 shooting
up	 whenever	 I	 tried	 to	 say
something.	 I	 finally	 turned
away	 from	 him,	 aimed	 my
body	 at	 the	 window,	 and
watched	 the	 woods	 flash	 by
in	a	blue-green	rush.
We	 parked	 in	 the	 same
spot	 where	 we’d	 overlooked
the	 river	 weeks	 before.	 It
roiled	 down	 below	 us	 in	 the
dark,	the	current	catching	the
moonlight	 in	 patches.	 Like
watching	 a	 beetle	 hustlethrough	fall	leaves.
“Now	 my	 turn	 for	 the
cliché,”	 Richard	 said,	 his
profile	 to	 me.	 “Yes,	 I	 was
first	interested	in	you	because
I	 was	 interested	 in	 your
mother.	 But	 I	 genuinely	 fell
for	you.	As	much	as	you	can
fall	for	a	person	as	closed	off
as	 you	 are.	 Of	 course,	 I
understand	 why.	 At	 first	 I
thought	I’d	formally	question
you,	 but	 I	 didn’t	 know	 how
close	 you	 and	 Adora	 were,	 Ididn’t	want	you	to	tip	her	off.
And	I	wasn’t	sure,	Camille.	I
wanted	time	to	study	her	a	bit
more.	 It	 was	 only	 a	 hunch.
Purely	 a	 hunch.	 Gossip	 here
and	 there,	 about	 you,	 about
Marian,	 about	 Amma	 and
your	mother.	But	it’s	true	that
women	 don’t	 fit	 the	 profile
for	 this	 kind	 of	 thing.	 Not
serial	 child	 murder.	 Then	 I
started	 to	 look	 at	 it
differently.”
“How?”	My	voice	dull	asscrap	metal.
“It	 was	 that	 kid,	 James
Capisi.	I	kept	coming	back	to
him,	 that	 fairy-tale	 wicked
witch	 of	 a	 woman.”	 Echoes
of	 Beverly,	 Brothers	 Grimm.
“I	still	don’t	think	he	actually
saw	 your	 mother,	 but	 I	 think
he	 remembered	 something,	 a
feeling	 or	 subconscious	 fear
that	turned	into	that	person.	I
started	thinking,	what	kind	of
woman	 would	 kill	 little	 girls
and	 steal	 their	 teeth?	 Awoman	 who	 wanted	 ultimate
control.	 A	 woman	 whose
nurturing	 instinct	 had	 gone
awry.	 Both	 Ann	 and	 Natalie
had	 been...tended	 to	 before
they	were	killed.	Both	sets	of
parents	noted	uncharacteristic
details.	 Natalie’s	 fingernails
were	 painted	 a	 bright	 pink.
Ann’s	 legs	 had	 been	 shaved.
They	 both	 had	 lipstick
applied	at	some	point.”
“What	about	the	teeth?”
“Isn’t	a	smile	a	girl’s	bestweapon?”	 Richard	 said.
Finally	 turning	 to	 me.	 “And
in	 the	 case	 of	 the	 two	 girls,
literally	a	weapon.	Your	story
about	 the	 biting	 really
focused	 things	 for	 me.	 The
killer	 was	 a	 woman	 who
resented	 strength	 in	 females,
who	 saw	 it	 as	 vulgar.	 She
tried	to	mother	the	little	girls,
to	 dominate	 them,	 to	 turn
them	 into	 her	 own	 vision.
When	 they	 rejected	 that,
struggled	 against	 that,	 thekiller	 flew	 into	 an	 outrage.
The	 girls	 had	 to	 die.
Strangling	 is	 the	 very
definition	 of	 dominance.
Slow-motion	murder.	I	closed
my	eyes	one	day	in	my	office
after	writing	down	the	profile,
and	I	saw	your	mother’s	face.
The	 sudden	 violence,	 her
closeness	 with	 the	 dead	 girls
—she	 has	 no	 alibi	 for	 either
night.	 Beverly	 Van	 Lumm’s
hunch	 about	 Marian	 adds	 to
it.	Although	we’ll	still	have	todisinter	 Marian	 to	 see	 if	 we
can	 get	 more	 solid	 evidence.
Traces	 of	 poisoning	 or
something.”
“Leave	her	be.”
“I	 can’t,	 Camille.	 You
know	 it’s	 the	 right	 thing.
We’ll	 be	 very	 respectful	 of
her.”	 He	 put	 his	 hand	 on	 my
thigh.	 Not	 my	 hand	 or	 my
shoulder,	but	my	thigh.
“Was	 John	 ever	 really	 a
suspect?”	Hand	removed.
“His	 name	 was	 alwaysswirling	around.	Vickery	was
kind	 of	 obsessed.	 Figured
Natalie	 was	 kind	 of	 violent,
maybe	John	was,	too.	Plus	he
was	 from	 out	 of	 town,	 and
you	 know	 how	 suspicious
out-of-towners	are.”
“Do	 you	 have	 any	 real
proof,	 Richard,	 about	 my
mother?	 Or	 is	 this	 all
supposition?”
“Tomorrow	 we’re	 getting
the	 order	 to	 search	 the	 place.
She’ll	 have	 kept	 the	 teeth.I’m	 telling	 you	 this	 as	 a
courtesy.	 Because	 I	 respect
and	trust	you.”
“Right,”	I	said.	Falling	lit
up	on	my	left	knee.	“I	need	to
get	Amma	out	of	there.”
“Nothing	 will	 happen
tonight.	You	need	to	go	home
and	 have	 a	 regular	 evening.
Act	as	naturally	as	possible.	I
can	 get	 your	 statement
tomorrow,	it’ll	be	a	good	help
to	the	case.”
“She’s	 been	 hurting	 meand	 Amma.	 Drugging	 us,
poisoning	 us.	 Something.”	 I
felt	nauseous	again.
Richard	took	his	hand	off
my	thigh.
“Camille,	 why	 didn’t	 you
say	 something	 before?	 We
could	 have	 had	 you	 tested.
That’d	be	a	great	thing	for	the
case.	Goddammit.”
“Thanks	 for	 the	 concern,
Richard.”
“Anyone	 ever	 tell	 you
you’re	 overly	 sensitive,Camille?”
“Not	once.”
	
Gayla	was	standing	at	the
door,	 a	 watchful	 ghost	 at	 our
house	 atop	 a	 hill.	 With	 a
flicker	she	was	gone,	and	as	I
pulled	 up	 to	 the	 carriage
porch,	 the	 light	 in	 the	 dining
room	switched	on.
Ham.	I	smelled	it	before	I
hit	 the	 door.	 Plus	 collard
greens,	corn.	They	all	sat	still
as	 actors	 before	 curtain.Scene:	 Suppertime.	 My
mother	 poised	 at	 the	 head	 of
the	 table,	 Alan	 and	 Amma	 to
each	 side,	 a	 place	 set	 for	 me
at	 the	 opposite	 end.	 Gayla
pulled	 the	 chair	 out	 for	 me,
whispered	 back	 into	 the
kitchen	 in	 her	 nurse’s	 garb.	 I
was	 sick	 of	 seeing	 nurses.
Beneath	 the	 floorboards,	 the
washing	machine	rumbled	on,
as	ever.
“Hello,	 darling,	 nice
day?”	 my	 mother	 called	 tooloudly.	 “Sit	 down,	 we’ve
been	 holding	 dinner	 for	 you.
Thought	we’d	have	dinner	as
a	 family	 since	 you’ll	 be
leaving	soon.”
“I	will?”
“They’re	set	to	arrest	your
little	 friend,	 dear.	 Don’t	 tell
me	 I’m	 better	 informed	 than
the	 reporter.”	 She	 turned	 to
Alan	 and	 Amma	 and	 smiled
like	 a	 congenial	 hostess
passing	 appetizers.	 She	 rang
her	 little	 bell,	 and	 Gaylabrought	 the	 ham	 in,	 gelatin-
wobbly,	 on	 a	 silver	 serving
tray.	 A	 pineapple	 slice	 slid
stickily	down	its	side.
“You	 cut,	 Adora,”	 Alan
said	 to	 my	 mother’s	 raised
eyebrows.
Wisps	 of	 blonde	 hair
fluttered	as	she	carved	finger-
thick	 slices,	 passed	 them
around	on	our	plates.	I	shook
my	 head	 at	 Amma	 as	 she
proffered	 me	 a	 serving,	 then
sent	it	on	to	Alan.“No	 ham,”	 my	 mother
muttered.	 “Still	 haven’t
grown	 out	 of	 that	 phase,
Camille.”
“The	 phase	 of	 not	 liking
ham?	No,	I	haven’t.”
“Do	 you	 think	 John	 will
be	 executed?”	 Amma	 asked
me.	 “Your	 John	 on	 death
row?”	 My	 mother	 had
outfitted	 her	 in	 a	 white
sundress	 with	 pink	 ribbons,
braided	 her	 hair	 tightly	 on
both	 sides.	 Her	 anger	 cameoff	her	like	a	stench.
“Missouri	 has	 the	 death
penalty,	 and	 certainly	 these
are	 the	 kind	 of	 murders	 that
beg	 for	 the	 death	 penalty,	 if
anything	 deserves	 that,”	 I
said.
“Do	 we	 still	 have	 an
electric	chair?”	Amma	asked.
“No,”	 Alan	 said.	 “Now
eat	your	meat.”
“Lethal	 injection,”	 my
mother	 murmured.	 “Like
putting	a	cat	to	sleep.”I	 pictured	 my	 mother
strapped	 to	 a	 gurney,
exchanging	 pleasantries	 with
the	 doctor	 before	 the	 needle
plunged	 in.	 Suitable,	 her
dying	 from	 a	 poisoned
needle.
“Camille,	 if	 you	 could	 be
any	 fairy-tale	 person	 in	 the
world,	 who	 would	 you	 be?”
Amma	asked.
“Sleeping	 Beauty.”	 To
spend	 a	 life	 in	 dreams,	 that
sounded	too	lovely.“I’d	be	Persephone.”
“I	 don’t	 know	 who	 that
is,”	 I	 said.	 Gayla	 slapped
some	 collards	 on	 my	 plate,
and	fresh	corn.	I	made	myself
eat,	a	kernel	at	a	time,	my	gag
reflex	 churning	 with	 each
chew.
“She’s	 the	 Queen	 of	 the
Dead,”	 Amma	 beamed.	 “She
was	 so	 beautiful,	 Hades	 stole
her	 and	 took	 her	 to	 the
underworld	 to	 be	 his	 wife.
But	her	mother	was	so	fierce,she	 forced	 Hades	 to	 give
Persephone	 back.	 But	 only
for	 six	 months	 each	 year.	 So
she	 spends	 half	 her	 life	 with
the	 dead,	 and	 half	 with	 the
living.”
“Amma,	 why	 would	 such
a	 creature	 appeal	 to	 you?”
Alan	 said.	 “You	 can	 be	 so
ghastly.”
“I	 feel	 sorry	 for
Persephone	 because	 even
when	 she’s	 back	 with	 the
living,	 people	 are	 afraid	 ofher	 because	 of	 where’s	 she’s
been,”	 Amma	 said.	 “And
even	 when	 she’s	 with	 her
mother,	 she’s	 not	 really
happy,	 because	 she	 knows
she’ll	 have	 to	 go	 back
underground.”	She	grinned	at
Adora	 and	 jabbed	 a	 big	 bite
of	 ham	 into	 her	 mouth,	 then
crowed.
“Gayla,	 I	 need	 sugar!”
Amma	yelled	at	the	door.
“Use	 the	 bell,	 Amma,”
my	 mother	 said.	 She	 wasn’teating	either.
Gayla	 came	 in	 with	 a
bowl	of	sugar,	sprinkled	a	big
spoonful	 over	 Amma’s	 ham
and	sliced	tomatoes.
“Let	me,”	Amma	whined.
“Let	 Gayla,”	 my	 mother
said.	“You	put	too	much	on.”
“Will	 you	 be	 sad	 when
John’s	 dead,	 Camille?”
Amma	 said,	 sucking	 on	 a
slice	 of	 ham.	 “Would	 you	 be
more	 sad	 if	 John	 died	 or	 I
did?”“I	 don’t	 want	 anyone	 to
die,”	 I	 said.	 “I	 think	 Wind
Gap	 has	 had	 too	 much	 death
as	it	is.”
“Hear-hear,”	 Alan	 said.
Oddly	festive.
“Certain	 people	 should
die.	John	should	die,”	Amma
continued.	 “Even	 if	 he	 didn’t
kill	 them,	 he	 still	 should	 die.
He’s	 ruined	 now	 that	 his
sister	is	dead.”
“By	 that	 same	 logic,	 I
should	die,	because	my	sisteris	 dead	 and	 I’m	 ruined,”	 I
said.	 Chewed	 another	 kernel.
Amma	studied	me.
“Maybe.	But	I	like	you	so
I	 hope	 not.	 What	 do	 you
think?”	 she	 turned	 to	 Adora.
It	 occurred	 to	 me	 she	 never
addressed	 her	 directly,	 no
Mother	 or	 Momma,	 or	 even
Adora.	 As	 if	 Amma	 didn’t
know	 her	 name	 but	 was
trying	not	to	be	obvious	about
it.
“Marian	died	a	long,	longtime	 ago,	 and	 I	 think	 maybe
we	 should	 have	 all	 ended
with	 her,”	 my	 mother	 said
wearily.	 Then	 suddenly
bright:	 “But	 we	 didn’t,	 and
we	 just	 keep	 moving	 on,
don’t	 we?”	 Ringing	 of	 bell,
gathering	 of	 plates,	 Gayla
circling	 the	 table	 like	 a
decrepit	wolf.
Bowls	 of	 blood-orange
sorbet	for	dessert.	My	mother
disappearing	 discreetly	 into
the	pantry	and	surfacing	withtwo	 slender	 crystal	 vials	 and
her	 wet	 pink	 eyes.	 My
stomach	lurched.
“Camille	 and	 I	 will	 have
drinks	 in	 my	 bedroom,”	 she
said	 to	 the	 others,	 fixing	 her
hair	 in	 the	 sideboard	 mirror.
She	 was	 dressed	 for	 it,	 I
realized,	 already	 in	 her
nightgown.	Just	as	I	had	as	a
child	 when	 I	 was	 summoned
to	 her,	 I	 trailed	 her	 up	 the
stairs.
And	then	I	was	inside	herroom,	 where	 I’d	 always
wanted	 to	 be.	 That	 massive
bed,	 pillows	 sprouting	 off	 it
like	barnacles.	The	full-length
mirror	 embedded	 in	 the	 wall.
And	 the	 famous	 ivory	 floor
that	made	everything	glow	as
if	 we	 were	 in	 a	 snowy,
moonlit	landscape.	She	tossed
the	 pillows	 to	 the	 floor,
pulled	 back	 the	 covers	 and
motioned	for	me	to	sit	in	bed,
then	 got	 in	 next	 to	 me.	 All
those	 months	 after	 Mariandied	 when	 she	 kept	 to	 her
room	 and	 refused	 me,	 I
wouldn’t	 have	 dared	 to
imagine	 myself	 curled	 up	 in
bed	 with	 my	 mother.	 Now
here	 I	 was,	 more	 than	 fifteen
years	too	late.
She	 ran	 her	 fingers
through	 my	 hair	 and	 handed
me	my	drink.	A	sniff:	smelled
like	 brown	 apples.	 I	 held	 it
stiffly	but	didn’t	sip.
“When	 I	 was	 a	 little	 girl,
my	 mother	 took	 me	 into	 theNorth	 Woods	 and	 left	 me,”
Adora	said.	“She	didn’t	seem
angry	 or	 upset.	 Indifferent.
Almost	 bored.	 She	 didn’t
explain	why.	She	didn’t	say	a
word	 to	 me,	 in	 fact.	 Just	 told
me	 to	 get	 in	 the	 car.	 I	 was
barefoot.	When	we	got	there,
she	 took	 me	 by	 the	 hand	 and
very	 efficiently	 pulled	 me
along	 the	 trail,	 then	 off	 the
trail,	 then	 dropped	 my	 hand
and	told	me	not	to	follow	her.
I	was	eight,	just	a	small	thing.My	 feet	 were	 ripped	 into
strips	by	the	time	I	got	home,
and	 she	 just	 looked	 up	 at	 me
from	 the	 evening	 paper,	 and
went	 to	 her	 room.	 This
room.”
“Why	 are	 you	 telling	 me
this?”
“When	a	child	knows	that
young	that	her	mother	doesn’t
care	 for	 her,	 bad	 things
happen.”
“Believe	me,	I	know	what
that	 feels	 like,”	 I	 said.	 Herhands	 were	 still	 running
through	 my	 hair,	 one	 finger
toying	with	my	bare	circle	of
scalp.
“I	 wanted	 to	 love	 you,
Camille.	 But	 you	 were	 so
hard.	 Marian,	 she	 was	 so
easy.”
“Enough,	 Momma,”	 I
said.
“No.	Not	enough.	Let	me
take	 care	 of	 you,	 Camille.
Just	once,	need	me.”
Let	it	end.	Let	it	all	end.“Let’s	do	it	then,”	I	said.	I
swallowed	the	drink	in	a	belt,
peeled	 her	 hands	 from	 my
head,	 and	 willed	 my	 voice	 to
be	steady.
“I	 needed	 you	 all	 along,
Momma.	In	a	real	way.	Not	a
need	 you	 created	 so	 you
could	turn	it	on	and	off.	And	I
can’t	 ever	 forgive	 you	 for
Marian.	She	was	a	baby.”
“She’ll	 always	 be	 my
baby,”	my	mother	said.	
Chapter	Sixteen
I	 fell	 asleep	 without	 the
fan	 on,	 woke	 up	 with	 the
sheets	 stuck	 to	 me.	 My	 own
sweat	 and	 urine.	 Teeth
chattering	 and	 my	 heartbeat
thumping	
behind	
my
eyeballs.	 I	 grabbed	 the	 trash
can	beside	my	bed	and	threw
up.	 Hot	 liquid,	 with	 four
kernels	 of	 corn	 bobbing	 on
top.My	 mother	 was	 in	 my
room	 before	 I	 pulled	 myself
back	 onto	 the	 bed.	 I	 pictured
her	 sitting	 in	 the	 hall	 chair,
next	 to	 the	 photo	 of	 Marian,
darning	 socks	 while	 she
waited	for	me	to	sicken.
“Come	 on,	 baby.	 Into	 the
bathtub	 with	 you,”	 she
murmured.	 She	 pulled	 my
shirt	 over	 my	 head,	 my
pajama	 bottoms	 down.	 I
could	 see	 her	 eyes	 on	 my
neck,	 breasts,	 hips,	 legs	 for	 asharp	blue	second.
I	 vomited	 again	 as	 I	 got
into	 the	 tub,	 my	 mother
holding	my	hand	for	balance.
More	 hot	 liquid	 down	 my
front	 and	 onto	 the	 porcelain.
Adora	 snapped	 a	 towel	 from
the	 rack,	 poured	 rubbing
alcohol	 into	 it,	 wiped	 me
down	with	the	objectivity	of	a
window	 cleaner.	 I	 sat	 in	 the
bathtub	as	she	poured	glasses
of	cold	water	over	my	head	to
bring	the	fever	down.	Fed	metwo	 more	 pills	 and	 another
glass	 of	 milk	 the	 color	 of
weak	 sky.	 I	 took	 it	 all	 with
the	 same	 bitter	 vengeance
that	 fueled	 me	 on	 two-day
benders.	 I’m	 not	 down	 yet,
what	else	you	got?	I	wanted	it
to	 be	 vicious.	 I	 owed	 Marian
that	much.
Vomiting	 into	 the	 tub,
draining	 the	 tub,	 refilling,
draining.	 Icepacks	 on	 my
shoulders,	 between	 my	 legs.
Heat	 packs	 on	 my	 forehead,my	 knees.	 Tweezers	 into	 the
wound	 on	 my	 ankle,	 rubbing
alcohol	 poured	 after.	 Water
flushing	pink.	Vanish,	vanish,
vanish,	 pleading	 from	 my
neck.
Adora’s	 lashes	 were
plucked	 clean,	 the	 left	 eye
dribbling	 plump	 tears,	 her
upper	 lip	 continually	 bathed
with	 her	 tongue.	 As	 I	 was
losing	 consciousness,	 a
thought:	I	am	being	cared	for.
My	 mother	 is	 in	 a	 sweatmothering	 me.	 Flattering.	 No
one	else	would	do	this	for	me.
Marian.	 I’m	 jealous	 of
Marian.
	
I	 was	 floating	 in	 a	 half-
full	 bath	 of	 lukewarm	 water
when	 I	 woke	 again	 to
screams.	Weak	and	steaming,
I	 pulled	 myself	 out	 of	 the
bath,	 wrapped	 a	 thin	 cotton
robe	
around	
me—my
mother’s	
high	
screams
jangling	 in	 my	 ears—andopened	 the	 door	 just	 as
Richard	busted	in.
“Camille,	 are	 you	 okay?”
My	 mother’s	 wails,	 wild	 and
ragged,	cutting	the	air	behind
him.
Then,	his	mouth	fell	open.
He	tilted	my	head	to	one	side,
looked	 at	 the	 cuts	 on	 my
neck.	 Pulled	 open	 my	 robe
and	flinched.
“Jesus	 Christ.”	 A	 psychic
wobbling:	
He	
teetered
between	laughter	and	fear.“What’s	 wrong	 with	 my
mother?”
“What’s	wrong	with	you?
You’re	a	cutter?”
“I	cut	words,”	I	muttered,
as	if	it	made	a	difference.
“Words,	I	can	see	that.”
“Why	 is	 my	 mother
screaming?”	I	felt	woozy,	sat
down	on	the	floor,	hard.
“Camille,	are	you	sick?”
I	 nodded.	 “Did	 you	 find
something?”
Vickery	 and	 severalofficers	 tumbled	 past	 my
room.	 My	 mother	 staggered
by	 a	 few	 seconds	 later,	 her
hands	 wrapped	 in	 her	 hair,
screaming	at	them	to	get	out,
to	 have	 respect,	 to	 know
they’ll	be	very	sorry.
“Not	 yet.	 How	 sick	 are
you?”	 He	 felt	 my	 forehead,
tied	 my	 robe	 shut,	 refused	 to
look	at	my	face	anymore.
I	 shrugged	 like	 a	 sulking
child.
“Everyone	 has	 to	 leavethe	 house,	 Camille.	 Put	 on
some	clothes	and	I’ll	get	you
to	the	doctor’s.”
“Yes,	 you	 need	 your
evidence.	 I	 hope	 I	 have
enough	poison	left	in	me.”
	
By	evening,	the	following
items	were	removed	from	my
mother’s	panty	drawer:
Eight	 vials	 of	 anti-
malarial	 pills	 with	 overseas
labels,	 big	 blue	 tablets	 that
had	been	discontinued	due	totheir	tendency	to	induce	fever
and	 blurred	 vision.	 Traces	 of
the	 drug	 were	 found	 in	 my
toxicology	tests.
Seventy-two	 tablets	 of
industrial-grade	laxative,	used
primarily	 for	 loosening	 the
bowels	 of	 farm	 animals.
Traces	 of	 which	 were	 found
in	my	toxicology	tests.
Three	 dozen	 anti-seizure
tablets,	 the	 misuse	 of	 which
can	 cause	 dizziness	 and
nausea.	Traces	of	which	werefound	in	my	toxicology	tests.
Three	 bottles	 of	 ipecac
syrup,	 used	 to	 induce
vomiting	 in	 case	 of
poisoning.	 Traces	 of	 which
were	 found	 in	 my	 toxicology
tests.
One	 hundred	 and	 sixty-
one	 horse	 tranquilizers.
Traces	 of	 which	 were	 found
in	my	toxicology	tests.
A	 nurses’	 kit,	 containing
dozens	 of	 loose	 pills,	 vials,
and	 syringes,	 none	 of	 whichAdora	 had	 any	 use	 for.	 Any
good	use	for.
	
From	 my	 mother’s	 hat
box,	 a	 flowered	 diary,	 which
would	 be	 entered	 as	 a	 court
document,	
containing
passages	 such	 as	 the
following:
	
SEPTEMBER	 14,
1982
I’ve	 decided	 today
to	 stop	 caring	 forCamille	 and	 focus	 on
Marian.	 Camille	 has
never	 become	 a	 good
patient—being	
sick
only	 makes	 her	 angry
and	 spiteful.	 She
doesn’t	 like	 me	 to
touch	 her.	 I’ve	 never
heard	 of	 such	 a	 thing.
She	 has	 Joya’s	 spite.	 I
hate	her.	Marian	is	such
a	 doll	 when	 she’s	 ill,
she	 dotes	 on	 me
terribly	 and	 wants	 mewith	 her	 all	 the	 time.	 I
love	 wiping	 away	 her
tears.
MARCH	23,	1985
Marian	had	to	go	to
Woodberry	
again,
“trouble	
breathing
since	 the	 morning,	 and
sick	 to	 her	 stomach.”	 I
wore	 my	 yellow	 St.
John	
suit,	
but
ultimately	 didn’t	 feel
good	 about	 it—I	 worrywith	 my	 blonde	 hair	 I
looked	 washed-out.	 Or
like	
a	
walking
pineapple!	Dr.	Jameson
is	 very	 masterful	 and
kind,	 interested	 in
Marian,	 but	 not	 a
busybody.	 He	 seems
quite	 impressed	 with
me.	 Said	 that	 I	 was	 an
angel,	 and	 that	 every
child	 should	 have	 a
mother	 like	 me.	 We
had	a	bit	of	a	flirtation,despite	 the	 wedding
rings.	 The	 nurses	 are
somewhat	 troubling.
Probably	 jealous.	 Will
have	to	really	dote	next
visit	 (surgery	 seems
likely!).	 Might	 have
Gayla	 make	 her	 mince
meat.	Nurses	love	little
treats	 for	 their	 break
area.	 Big	 green	 ribbon
around	 the	 jar,	 maybe?
I	 need	 to	 get	 my	 hair
done	 before	 the	 nextemergency...hope	 Dr.
Jameson	 (Rick)	 is	 on
call...
MAY	10,	1988
Marian	 is	 dead.	 I
couldn’t	 stop.	 I’ve	 lost
12	pounds	and	am	skin
and	 bones.	 Everyone’s
been	 incredibly	 kind.
People	 can	 be	 so
wonderful.
The	most	important	piece
of	 evidence	 was	 discoveredunder	 the	 cushion	 of	 the
yellow	 brocade	 love	 seat	 in
Adora’s	 room:	 a	 stained	 pair
of	pliers,	small	and	feminine.
DNA	 tests	 matched	 trace
blood	 on	 the	 tool	 to	 Ann
Nash	and	Natalie	Keene.
The	 teeth	 were	 not	 found
in	 my	 mother’s	 home.	 I	 had
images	 for	 weeks	 after	 of
where	 they	 might	 have	 gone:
I	saw	a	baby	blue	convertible
driving,	 top	 up	 as	 always—a
woman’s	hand	jutting	out	thewindow—a	 spray	 of	 teeth
into	 the	 roadside	 thicket	 near
the	 path	 into	 the	 North
Woods.	 A	 set	 of	 delicate
slippers	 getting	 muddied	 at
the	 edge	 of	 Falls	 Creek—
teeth	 plopping	 like	 pebbles
into	 the	 water.	 A	 pink
nightgown	 floating	 through
Adora’s	 rose	 garden—hands
digging—teeth	 buried	 like
tiny	bones.
The	 teeth	 were	 not	 found
in	 any	 of	 these	 places.	 I	 hadthe	police	check.	
Chapter	Seventeen
On	 May	 28,	 Adora
Crellin	 was	 arrested	 for	 the
murders	of	Ann	Nash,	Natalie
Keene,	 and	 Marian	 Crellin.
Alan	 immediately	 paid	 the
punishing	 bail	 sum	 so	 she
could	 await	 trial	 in	 the
comfort	 of	 her	 home.
Considering	the	situation,	the
court	thought	it	best	for	me	to
take	custody	of	my	half	sister.Two	days	later	I	drove	north,
back	to	Chicago,	with	Amma
beside	me.
	
She	exhausted	me.	Amma
was	 wildly	 needy	 and	 afire
with	 anxiety—took	 to	 pacing
like	 a	 caged	 wildcat	 as	 she
fired	 angry	 questions	 at	 me
(Why	 is	 everything	 so	 loud?
How	 can	 we	 live	 in	 such	 a
tiny	 place?	 Isn’t	 it	 dangerous
outside?)	 and	 demanded
assurance	 of	 my	 love.	 Shewas	burning	off	all	that	extra
energy	 from	 not	 being
bedridden	 several	 times	 a
month.
By	 August	 she	 was
obsessed	 with	 female	 killers.
Lucretia	 Borgia,	 Lizzie
Borden,	 a	 woman	 in	 Florida
who	 drowned	 her	 three
daughters	 after	 a	 nervous
breakdown.	 “I	 think	 they’re
special,”	
Amma	
said
defiantly.	 Trying	 to	 find	 a
way	 to	 forgive	 her	 mother,her	 child	 therapist	 said.
Amma	saw	the	woman	twice,
then	 literally	 lay	 on	 the	 floor
and	screamed	when	I	tried	to
take	 her	 for	 a	 third	 visit.
Instead,	 she	 worked	 on	 her
Adora	 dollhouse	 most	 hours
of	 the	 day.	 Her	 way	 of
dealing	 with	 the	 ugly	 things
that	 happened	 there,	 her
therapist	said	when	I	phoned.
Seems	 like	 she	 should	 smash
the	 thing	 then,	 I	 answered.
Amma	slapped	me	in	the	facewhen	 I	 brought	 home	 the
wrong	color	of	blue	cloth	for
Adora’s	 dollhouse	 bed.	 She
spat	 on	 the	 floor	 when	 I
refused	 to	 pay	 $60	 for	 a	 toy
sofa	 made	 of	 real	 walnut.	 I
tried	hug	therapy,	a	ridiculous
program	 that	 instructed	 I
clutch	 Amma	 to	 me	 and
repeat	I	love	you	I	love	you	I
love	 you	 as	 she	 tried	 to
wriggle	away.	Four	times	she
broke	 free	 and	 called	 me	 a
bitch,	 slammed	 her	 door.Fifth	 time	 we	 both	 started
laughing.
	
Alan	 loosened	 some	 cash
to	 enroll	 Amma	 at	 the	 Bell
School—$22,000	 a	 year,	 not
counting	 books	 and	 supplies
—just	 nine	 blocks	 away.	 She
made	 quick	 friends,	 a	 little
circle	 of	 pretty	 girls	 who
learned	to	yearn	for	all	things
Missouri.	 The	 one	 I	 really
liked	 was	 a	 girl	 named	 Lily
Burke.	 She	 was	 as	 bright	 asAmma,	 with	 a	 sunnier
outlook.	 She	 had	 a	 spray	 of
freckles,	 oversized	 front
teeth,	 and	 hair	 the	 color	 of
chocolate,	 which	 Amma
pointed	 out	 was	 the	 exact
shade	 of	 the	 rug	 in	 my	 old
bedroom.	I	liked	her	anyway.
She	 became	 a	 fixture	 at
the	 apartment,	 helping	 me
cook	 dinner,	 asking	 me
questions	 about	 homework,
telling	 stories	 about	 boys.
Amma	 got	 progressivelyquieter	 with	 each	 of	 Lily’s
visits.	By	October,	she’d	shut
her	door	pointedly	when	Lily
came	by.
	
One	 night	 I	 woke	 to	 find
Amma	standing	over	my	bed.
“You	like	Lily	better	than
me,”	she	whispered.	She	was
feverish,	 her	 nightgown
clinging	 to	 her	 sweaty	 body,
her	 teeth	 chattering.	 I	 guided
her	into	the	bathroom,	sat	her
down	 on	 the	 toilet,	 wet	 awashcloth	 under	 the	 cool,
metallic	 water	 of	 the	 sink,
wiped	 her	 brow.	 Then	 we
stared	 at	 each	 other.	 Slate
blue	 eyes	 just	 like	 Adora’s.
Blank.	Like	a	winter	pond.
I	 poured	 two	 aspirin	 into
my	 palm,	 put	 them	 back	 in
the	 bottle,	 poured	 them	 back
onto	 my	 palm.	 One	 or	 two
pills.	 So	 easy	 to	 give.	 Would
I	 want	 to	 give	 another,	 and
another?	 Would	 I	 like	 taking
care	 of	 a	 sick	 little	 girl?	 Arustle	 of	 recognition	 when
she	 looked	 up	 at	 me,	 shaky
and	sick:	Mother’s	here.
I	gave	Amma	two	aspirin.
The	 smell	 made	 my	 mouth
water.	I	poured	the	rest	down
the	drain.
“Now	you	have	to	put	me
in	the	bathtub	and	wash	me,”
she	whined.
I	 pulled	 her	 nightgown
over	her	head.	Her	nakedness
was	 stunning:	 sticky	 little
girl’s	 legs,	 a	 jagged	 roundscar	 on	 her	 hip	 like	 half	 a
bottle	cap,	the	slightest	down
in	a	wilted	thatch	between	her
legs.	Full,	voluptuous	breasts.
Thirteen.
She	 got	 into	 the	 bathtub
and	 pulled	 her	 legs	 to	 her
chin.
“You	 need	 to	 rub	 alcohol
on	me,”	she	whimpered.
“No	Amma,	just	relax.”
Amma’s	 face	 turned	 pink
and	she	began	crying.
“That’s	 how	 she	 does	 it,”she	 whispered.	 The	 tears
turned	 into	 sobs,	 then	 a
mournful	howl.
“We’re	not	going	to	do	it
like	 she	 does	 it	 anymore,”	 I
said.
	
On	 October	 12,	 Lily
Burke	 disappeared	 on	 her
way	 home	 from	 school.	 Four
hours	 later,	 her	 body	 was
found,	 propped	 tidily	 next	 to
a	Dumpster	three	blocks	from
our	 apartment.	 Only	 six	 ofher	teeth	had	been	pulled,	the
oversized	 front	 two	 and	 four
on	the	bottom.
I	 phoned	 Wind	 Gap	 and
waited	 on	 hold	 twelve
minutes	
until	
police
confirmed	 my	 mother	 was	 in
her	home.
	
I	 found	 it	 first.	 I	 let	 the
police	discover	it,	but	I	found
it	 first.	 As	 Amma	 trailed	 me
like	 an	 angry	 dog,	 I	 tore
though	
the	
apartment,upending	 seat	 cushions,
rummaging	 through	 drawers.
What	have	you	done,	Amma?
By	the	time	I	got	to	her	room,
she	 was	 calm.	 Smug.	 I	 sifted
through	 her	 panties,	 dumped
out	 her	 wish	 chest,	 turned
over	her	mattress.
I	 went	 through	 her	 desk
and	 uncovered	 only	 pencils,
stickers,	 and	 a	 cup	 that	 stank
of	bleach.
I	swept	out	the	contents	of
the	 dollhouse	 room	 by	 room,smashing	my	little	four-poster
bed,	 Amma’s	 day	 bed,	 the
lemon	yellow	love	seat.	Once
I’d	flung	out	my	mother’s	big
brass	 canopy	 and	 destroyed
her	vanity	table,	either	Amma
or	I	screamed.	Maybe	both	of
us	 did.	 The	 floor	 of	 my
mother’s	room.	The	beautiful
ivory	 tiles.	 Made	 of	 human
teeth.	 Fifty-six	 tiny	 teeth,
cleaned	 and	 bleached	 and
shining	from	the	floor.
	Others	were	implicated	in
the	 Wind	 Gap	 child	 murders.
In	 exchange	 for	 lighter
sentences	 in	 a	 psychiatric
hospital,	 the	 three	 blondes
admitted	 to	 helping	 Amma
kill	 Ann	 and	 Natalie.	 They’d
zipped	 out	 in	 Adora’s	 golf
cart	 and	 idled	 near	 Ann’s
home,	talked	her	into	coming
for	 a	 ride.	 My	 mother	 wants
to	say	hi.
The	 girls	 putted	 to	 the
North	 Woods,	 pretendedthey’d	 have	 a	 tea	 party	 of
sorts.	 They	 prettied	 Ann	 up,
played	 with	 her	 a	 bit,	 then
after	 a	 few	 hours,	 got	 bored.
They	started	marching	Ann	to
the	 creek.	 The	 little	 girl,
sensing	 an	 ill	 wind,	 had	 tried
to	 run	 away,	 but	 Amma
chased	 her	 down	 and	 tackled
her.	 Hit	 her	 with	 a	 rock.	 Got
bitten.	 I	 saw	 the	 wound	 on
her	 hip,	 but	 had	 failed	 to
realize	 what	 that	 jagged	 half
moon	meant.The	 three	 blondes	 held
Ann	 down,	 while	 Amma
strangled	 her	 with	 a
clothesline	 she’d	 stolen	 from
a	neighbor’s	tool	shed.	It	took
an	 hour	 to	 calm	 Jodes	 down
and	 another	 hour	 for	 Amma
to	pull	the	teeth,	Jodes	crying
the	whole	time.	Then	the	four
girls	 carried	 the	 body	 to	 the
water	 and	 dumped	 it,	 zipped
back	 over	 to	 Kelsey’s	 home,
cleaned	 up	 in	 the	 back
carriage	house,	and	watched	amovie.	 No	 one	 could	 agree
what	 it	 was.	 They	 all
remembered	
they	
ate
cantaloupe	 and	 drank	 white
wine	 from	 Sprite	 bottles,	 in
case	 Kelsey’s	 mom	 peeked
in.
James	Capisi	wasn’t	lying
about	 that	 ghostly	 woman.
Amma	 had	 stolen	 one	 of	 our
pristine	 white	 sheets	 and
fashioned	 it	 into	 a	 Grecian
dress,	tied	up	her	light-blonde
hair,	 and	 powdered	 herselfuntil	 she	 glowed.	 She	 was
Artemis,	 the	 blood	 huntress.
Natalie	 had	 been	 bewildered
at	 first	 when	 Amma	 had
whispered	 into	 her	 ear,	 It’s	 a
game.	 Come	 with	 me,	 we’ll
play.	 She	 spirited	 Natalie
through	 the	 woods,	 back
again	 to	 Kelsey’s	 carriage
house,	 where	 they	 held	 her	 a
full	forty-eight	hours,	tending
to	 her,	 shaving	 her	 legs,
dressing	 her	 up,	 and	 feeding
her	 in	 shifts	 as	 they	 enjoyedthe	 increasing	 outcry.	 Just
after	 midnight	 on	 the	 14th,
the	 friends	 held	 her	 down
while	 Amma	 strangled	 her.
Again,	 she	 pulled	 the	 teeth
herself.	 Children’s	 teeth,	 it
turns	 out,	 aren’t	 too	 hard	 to
remove,	 if	 you	 put	 real
weight	 on	 the	 pliers.	 And	 if
you	 don’t	 care	 how	 they	 end
up	looking.	(Flash	of	Amma’s
dollhouse	 floor,	 with	 its
mosaic	 of	 jagged,	 broken
teeth,	some	mere	splinters.)The	 girls	 putt-putted	 in
Adora’s	 golf	 cart	 to	 the	 back
side	of	Main	Street	at	four	in
the	 morning.	 The	 aperture
between	 the	 hardware	 store
and	 beauty	 parlor	 was	 just
wide	 enough	 to	 allow	 Amma
and	 Kelsey	 to	 carry	 Natalie
by	hands	and	feet,	single	file,
to	 the	 other	 side,	 where	 they
propped	 her	 up,	 waited	 for
the	 discovery.	 Again	 Jodes
cried.	 The	 girls	 later
discussed	killing	her,	worriedshe	 might	 crumble.	 The	 idea
was	 almost	 in	 action	 when
my	mother	was	arrested.
Amma	 killed	 Lily	 all	 by
herself,	hit	her	on	the	back	of
the	 head	 with	 a	 stone,	 then
strangled	her	with	bare	hands,
plucked	the	six	teeth,	and	cut
her	 hair.	 All	 down	 an	 alley,
behind	 that	 Dumpster	 where
she’d	 left	 the	 body.	 She’d
brought	 the	 rock,	 pliers,	 and
scissors	 to	 school	 in	 the	 hot
pink	backpack	I’d	bought	forher.
Lily	 Burke’s	 chocolate-
colored	 hair	 Amma	 braided
into	a	rug	for	my	room	in	her
dollhouse.
