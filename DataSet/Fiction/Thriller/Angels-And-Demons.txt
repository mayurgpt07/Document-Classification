      Physicist Leonardo Ve tra smelled burning flesh, and he knew it was his own. He stared up in terror at 
      the dark figure looming over him. "What do you want!" 
      "La chiave," the raspy voice replied. "The password." 
      "But... I don't -" 
      The intruder pressed down again, grinding the white hot object deeper into Vetra's chest. There was 
      the hiss of broiling flesh. 
      Vetra cried out in agony. "There is no password!" He felt himself drifting toward unconsciousness. 
      The figure glared. "Ne avevo paura. I was afraid of that." 
      Vetra fought to kee p his senses, but the darkness was closing in. His only solace was in knowing his 
      attacker would never obtain what he had come for. A moment later, however, the figure produced a 
      blade and brought it to Vetra's face. The blade hovered. Carefully. Surgically. 
      "For the love of God!" Vetra screamed. But it was too late.  
       
                         3  
      hair, probing blue eyes, an arrestingly deep voice, and the strong, carefree smile of a collegiate athlete. 
      A varsity diver in prep school and college, Langdon still had the body of a swimmer, a toned, six-foot 
      physique that he vigilantly maintained with fifty laps a day in the university pool. 
      Langdon's friends had always viewed him as a bit of an enigma-a man caught between centuries. On 
      weekends he could be seen lounging on the quad in blue jeans, discussing computer graphics or 
      religious history with students; other times he could be spotted in his Harris tweed and paisley vest, 
      photographed in the pages of upscale art magazines at museum openings where he had been asked to  
      lecture. Although a tough teacher and strict disciplinarian, Langdon was the first to embrace what he 
      hailed as the "lost art of good clean fun." He relished recreation with an infectious fanaticism that had 
      earned him a fraternal acceptance among his students. His campus nickname-"The Dolphin" -was a 
      reference both to his affable nature and his legendary ability to dive into a pool and outmaneuver the 
      entire opposing squad in a water polo match. 
      As Langdon sat alone, absently gazing into the darkness, the silence of his home was shattered again, 
      this time by the ring of his fax machine. Too exhausted to be annoyed, Langdon forced a tired chuckle. 
      God's people, he thought. Two thousand years of waiting for their Messiah, and they're still persistent 
      as hell. 
      Wearily, he returned his empty mug to the kitchen and walked slowly to his oak-paneled study. T he 
      incoming fax lay in the tray. Sighing, he scooped up the paper and looked at it. Instantly, a wave of 
      nausea hit him.  
      The image on the page was that of a human corpse. The body had been stripped naked, and its head 
      had been twisted, facing completely backward. On the victim's chest was a terrible burn. The man had 
      been branded... imprinted with a single word. It was a word Langdon knew well. Very well. He stared 
      at the ornate lettering in disbelief.  
      "Illuminati," he stammered, his heart pounding. It can't be... In slow motion, afraid of what he was 
      about to witness, Langdon rotated the fax 180 degrees. He looked at the word upside down. 
      Instantly, the breath went out of him. It was like he had been hit by a truck. Barely able to believe his 
      eyes, he rotat ed the fax again, reading the brand right-side up and then upside down.  
      "Illuminati," he whispered. 
      Stunned, Langdon collapsed in a chair. He sat a moment in utter bewilderment. Gradually, his eyes 
      were drawn to the blinking red light on his fax machine. Whoever had sent this fax was still on the 
      line... waiting to talk. Langdon gazed at the blinking light a long time. Then, trembling, he picked up 
      the receiver. 
       
                         5  
                            3 
        
       
      Thousands of miles away, two men were meeting. The chamber was dark. Medieval. Stone. 
      "Benvenuto," the man in charge said. He was seated in the shadows, out of sight.  
      "Were you successful?" 
      "Si," the dark figure replied. "Perfectamente." His words were as hard as the rock walls. 
      "And there will be no doubt who is responsible?" 
      "None."  
      "Superb. Do you have what I asked for?" 
      The killer's eyes glistened, black like oil. He produced a heavy electronic device and set it on the table. 
      The man in the shadows seemed pleased. "You have done well." 
      "Serving the brotherhood is an honor," the killer said. 
      "Phase two begins shortly. Get some rest. Tonight we change the world." 
                         7  
      fortune for his airy, high -ceilinged Victorian home even though economical faculty housing was readily 
      available. Langdon had often suspected his attraction to the art world as a young boy sprang from his 
      love of museums' wide open spaces.  
      The engines roared to life beneath him, sending a deep shudder through the hull. Langdon swallowed 
      hard and waited. He felt the plane start taxiing. Piped-in country music began playing quietly overhead. 
      A phone on the wall beside him beeped twice. Langdon lifted the receiver.   
      "Hello?" 
      "Comfortable, Mr. Langdon?" 
      "Not at all." 
      "Just relax. We'll be there in an hour." 
      "And where exactly is there?" Langdon asked, realizing he had no idea where he was headed. 
      "Geneva," the pilot replied, revving the engines. "The lab's in Geneva." 
      "Geneva," Langdon repeated, feeling a little better. "Upstate New York. I've actually got family near 
      Seneca Lake. I wasn't aware Geneva had a physics lab." 
      The pilot laughed. "Not Geneva, New York, Mr. Langdon. Geneva, Switzerland." 
      The word took a long moment to register. "Switzerland?" Langdon felt his pulse surge. "I thought you 
      said the lab was only an hour away!" 
      "It is, Mr. Langdon." The pilot chuckled. "This plane goes Mach fifteen." 
       
                         9  
      used today, even in modern English... but like the craft of killing, the word had evolved. It was now 
      pronounced assassin. 
                         11  
      "Passenger name?" 
      "Robert Langdon," the driver replied. 
      "Guest of?"  
      "The director."  
      The sentry arched his eyebrows. He turned and checked a computer printout, verifying it against the 
      data on his computer screen. Then he returned to the window. "Enjoy your stay, Mr. Langdon." 
      The car shot off again, accelerating another 200 yards around a sweeping rotary that led to the facility's 
      main entrance. Looming before them was a rectangular, ultramodern structure of glass and steel. 
      Langdon was amazed by the building's striking transparent design. He had always had a fond love of 
      architecture. 
      "The Glass Cathedral," the escort offered. 
      "A church?" 
      "Hell, no. A church is the one thing we don't have. Physics is the religion around here. Use the Lord's 
      name in vain all you like," he laughed, "just don't slander any quarks or mesons." 
      Langdon sat bewildered as the driver swung the car around and brought it to a stop in front of the 
      glass building. Quarks and mesons? No border control? Mach 15 jets? Who the hell ARE these guys? 
      The engraved granite slab in front of the building bore the answer: 
      (CERN) 
      Conseil Europ��en pour la Recherche Nucl��aire  
      "Nuclear Research?" Langdon asked, fairly certain his translation was correct. The driver did not 
      answer. He was leaning forward, busily adjusting the car's cassette player. "This is your stop. The 
      director will meet you at this entrance." 
      Langdon noted a man in a wheelchair exiting the building. He looked to be in his early sixties. Gaunt 
      and totally bald with a sternly set jaw, he wore a white lab coat and dress shoes propped firmly on the 
      wheelchair's footrest. Even at a distance his eyes looked lifeless-like two gray stones.  
      "Is that him?" Langdon asked. 
      The driver looked up. "Well, I'll be." He turned and gave Langdon an ominous smile. "Speak of the 
      devil." 
      Uncertain what to expect, Langdon stepped from the vehicle.  
      The man in the wheelchair accelerated toward Langdon and offered a clammy hand. 
      "Mr. Langdon? We spoke on the phone. My name is Maximilian Kohler." 
                         13  
      "You sound skeptical," Kohler said. "I thought you were a religious symbologist. Do you not believe in 
      miracles?" 
      "I'm undecided on miracles," Langdon said. Particularly those that take place in science labs.  
      "Perhaps miracle is the wrong word. I was simply trying to speak your language." 
      "My language?" Langdon was suddenly uncomfortable. "Not to disappoint you, sir, but I study 
      religious symbology -I'm an academic, not a priest." 
      Kohler slowed suddenly and turned, his gaze softening a bit. "Of course. How simple of me. One does 
      not need to have cancer to analyze its symptoms." 
      Langdon had never heard it put quite that way. As they moved down the hallway, Kohler gave an 
      accepting nod. "I suspect you and I will understand each other perfectly, Mr. Langdon." 
      Somehow Langdon doubted it. As the pair hurried on, Langdon began to sense a deep rumbling up 
      ahead. The noise got more and more pronounced with every step, reverberating through the walls. It 
      seemed to be coming from the end of the hallway in front of them. 
      "What's that?" Langdon finally asked, having to yell. He felt like they were approaching an active 
      volcano.  
      "Free Fall Tube," Kohler replied, his hollow voice cutting the air effortlessly. He offered no other 
      explanation.  
      Langdon didn't ask. He was exhausted, and Maximilian Kohler seemed disinterested in winning any 
      hospitality awards. Langdon reminded himself why he was here. Illuminati. He assumed somewhere in 
      this colossal facility was a body... a body branded with a symbol he had just flown 3,000 miles to see. 
      As they approached the end of the hall, the rumble became almost deafening, vibrating up through 
      Langdon's soles. They rounded the bend, and a viewing gallery appeared on the right. Four thick-paned 
      portals were embedded in a curved wall, like windows in a submarine. Langdon stopped and looked 
      through one of the holes. Professor Robert Langdon had seen some strange things in his life, but this 
      was the strangest . He blinked a few times, wondering if he was hallucinating. He was staring into an 
      enormous circular chamber. Inside the chamber, floating as though weightless, were people. Three of 
      them. One waved and did a somersault in midair. My God, he thought. I'm in the land of Oz. 
      The floor of the room was a mesh grid, like a giant sheet of chicken wire. Visible beneath the grid was 
      the metallic blur of a huge propeller.   
      "Free fall tube," Kohler said, stopping to wait for him. "Indoor skydiving. For stress relief. It's a 
      vertical wind tunnel."  
      Langdon looked on in amazement. One of the free fallers, an obese woman, maneuvered toward the 
      window. She was being buffeted by the air currents but grinned and flashed Langdon the thumbs-up 
      sign. 
      Langdon smiled weakly and returned the gesture, wondering if she knew it was the ancient phallic 
      symbol for masculine virility. The heavyset woman, Langdon noticed, was the only one wearing what 
      appeared to be a miniature parachute. The swathe of fabric billowed over her like a toy. "What's her 
      little chute for?" Langdon asked Kohler. "It can't be more than a yard in diameter." 
      "Friction," Kohler said. "Decreases her aerodynamics so the fan can lift her." 
      He started down the the corridor again. "One square yard of drag will slow a falling body almost 
      twenty percent." 
      Langdon nodded blankly. 
      He never suspected that later that night, in a country hundreds of miles away, the information would 
      save his life.  
       
                         15  
      "Congratulations," Kohler said when Langdon finally caught up. "You just played toss with a Noble 
      prizewinner, Georges Charpak, inventor of the multiwire proportional chamber." 
      Langdon nodded. My lucky day.  
      It took Langdon and Kohler three more minutes to reach their destination -a large, well-kept dormitory 
      sitting in a grove of aspens. Compared to the other dorms, this structure seemed luxurious. The carved 
      stone sign in front read BUILDING C. 
      Imaginative title, Langdon thought. But despite its sterile name, Building C appealed to Langdon's 
      sense of architectural style -conservative and solid. It had a red brick facade, an ornate balustrade, and 
      sat framed by sculpted symmetrical hedges. As the two men ascended the stone path toward the entry, 
      they passed under a gateway formed by a pair of marble columns. Someone had put a sticky-note on 
      one of them.  
      THIS COLUMN IS IONIC  
      Physicist graffiti? Langdon mused, eyeing the column and chuckling to himself. 
      "I'm relieved to see that even brilliant physicists make mistakes."  
      Kohler looked over. "What do you mean?" 
      "Whoever wrote that note made a mistake. That column isn't Ionic. Ionic columns 
      are uniform in width. That one's tapered. It's Doric-the Greek counterpart. A common mistake." 
      Kohler did not smile. "The author meant it as a joke, Mr. Langdon. Ionic means containing ions-
      electrically charged particles. Most objects contain them." 
      Langdon looked back at the column and groaned. 
      Langdon was still feeling stupid when he stepped from the elevator on the top floor of Building C. He 
      followed Kohler down a well-appointed corridor. The decor was unexpected-traditional colonial 
      French-a cherry divan, porcelain floor vase, and scrolled woodwork.  
      "We like to keep our tenured scientists comfortable," Kohler explained. 
      Evidently, Langdon thought. "So the man in the fax lived up here? One of your upper-level 
      employees?"  
      "Quite," Kohler said. "He missed a meeting with me this morning and did not answer his page. I came 
      up here to locate him and found him dead in his living room." 
      Langdon felt a sudden chill realizing that he was about to see a dead body. His stomach had never been 
      particularly stalwart. It was a weakness he'd discovered as an art student when the teacher informed the 
      class that Leonardo da Vinci had gained his expertise in the human form by exhuming corpses and 
      dissecting their musculature.  
      Kohler led the way to the far end of the hallway. There was a single door. "The Penthouse, as you 
      would say," Kohler announced, dabbing a bead of perspiration from his forehead. Langdon eyed the 
      lone oak door before them. The name plate read: 
      LEONARDO VETRA 
      "Leonardo Vetra," Kohler said, "would have been fifty-eight next week. He was one of the most 
      brilliant scientists of our time. His death is a profound loss for science." 
      For an instant Langdon thought he sensed emotion in Kohler's hardened face. But as quickly as it had 
      come, it was gone. Kohler reached in his pocket and began sifting through a large key ring. 
      An odd thought suddenly occurred to Langdon. The building seemed deserted. 
      "Where is everyone?" he asked. The lack of activity was hardly what he expected considering they were 
      about to enter a murder scene. 
      "The residents are in their labs," Kohler replied, finding the key. 
      "I mean the police," Langdon clarified. "Have they left already?" 
      Kohler paused, his key halfway into the lock. "Police?" 
      Langdon's eyes met the director's. "Police. You sent me a fax of a homicide. You must have called the 
      police." 
      "I most certainly have not." 
      "What?" 
      Kohler's gray eyes sharpened. "The situation is complex, Mr. Langdon." 
      Langdon felt a wave of apprehension. "But... certainly someone else knows about this!" 
                         17  
                            9 
        
       
      The corpse on the floor before Langdon was hideous. The late Leonardo Vetra lay on his back, 
      stripped naked, his skin bluish-gray. His neck bones were jutting out where they had been broken, and 
      his head was twisted completely backward, pointing the wrong way. His face was out of view, pressed 
      against the floor. The man lay in a frozen puddle of his own urine, the hair around his shriveled 
      genitals spidered with frost. 
      Fighting a wave of nausea, Langdon let his eyes fall to the victim's chest. Although Langdon had stared 
      at the symmetrical wound a dozen times on the fax, the burn was infinitely more commanding in real 
      life. The raised, broiled flesh was perfectly delineated... the symbol flawlessly formed. 
      Langdon wondered if the intense chill now raking through his body was the air-conditioning or his 
      utter amazement with the significance of what he was now staring at. 
      His heart pounded as he circled the body, reading the word upside down, reaffirming the genius of the 
      symmetry. The symbol seemed even less conceivable now that he was staring at it.  
      "Mr. Langdon?"  
      Langdon did not hear. He was in another world... his world, his element, a world where history, myth, 
      and fact collided, flooding his senses. The gears turned.  
      "Mr. Langdon?" Kohler's eyes probed expectantly.  
      Langdon did not look up. His disposition now intensified, his focus total. "How much do you already 
      know?" 
      "Only what I had time to read on your website. The word Illuminati means 'the enlightened ones.' It is 
      the name of some sort of ancient brotherhood."  
      Langdon nodded. "Had you heard the name before?" 
      "Not until I saw it branded on Mr. Vetra." 
      "So you ran a web search for it?" 
      "Yes." 
      "And the word returned hundreds of references, no doubt." 
      "Thousands," Kohler said. "Yours, however, contained references to Harvard, Oxford, a reputable 
      publisher, as well as a list of related publications. As a scientist I have come to learn that information is 
      only as valuable as its source. Your credentials seemed authentic." 
      Langdon's eyes were still riveted on the body. 
      Kohler said nothing more. He simply stared, apparently waiting for Langdon to shed some light on the 
      scene before them.  
      Langdon looked up, glancing around the frozen flat. "Perhaps we should discuss this in a warmer 
      place?" 
      "This room is f ine." Kohler seemed oblivious to the cold. "We'll talk here." 
      Langdon frowned. The Illuminati history was by no means a simple one. I'll freeze to death trying to 
      explain it. He gazed again at the brand, feeling a renewed sense of awe. Although accounts of the 
      Illuminati emblem were legendary in modern symbology, no academic had ever actually seen it. 
      Ancient documents described the symbol as an ambigram-ambi meaning "both"-signifying 
      it was legible both ways. And although ambigrams were common in symbology-swastikas, yin yang, 
      Jewish stars, simple crosses-the idea that a word could be crafted into an ambigram seemed utterly 
      impossible. Modern symbologists had tried for years to forge the word "Illuminati" into a perfectly 
      symmetrical style, but they had failed miserably. Most academics had now decided the symbol's 
      existence was a myth. 
      "So who are the Illuminati?" Kohler demanded. 
      Yes, Langdon thought, who indeed? He began his tale. 
      "Since the beginning of history," Langdon explained, "a deep rift has existed between science and 
      religion. Outspoken scientists like Copernicus-" 
      "Were murdered," Kohler interjected. "Murdered by the church for revealing scientific truths. Religion 
      has always persecuted science." 
                         19  
      considered them the single most dangerous anti-Christian force on earth. The Vatican denounced the 
      brotherhood as Shaitan."  
      "Shaitan?" 
      "It's Islamic. It means 'adversary'... God's adversary. The church chose Islam for the name because it 
      was a language they considered dirty." Langdon hesitated. "Shaitan is the root of an English word... 
      Satan." 
      An uneasiness crossed Kohler's face. Langdon's voice was grim.  
      "Mr. Kohler, I do not know how this marking appeared on this man's chest... or why... but you are 
      looking at the long-lost symbol of the world's oldest and most powerful satanic cult." 
                         21  
                            11 
        
       
      Satanic?" Kohler wiped his mouth and shifted uncomfortably. "This is the symbol of a satanic cult?" 
      Langdon paced the frozen room to keep warm.  
      "The Illuminati were satanic. But not in the modern sense." 
      Langdon quickly explained how most people pictured satanic cults as devil-worshiping fiends, and yet 
      Satanists historically were educated men who stood as adversaries to the church. Shaitan. The rumors 
      of satanic black -magic animal  sacrifices and the pentagram ritual were nothing but lies spread by the 
      church as a smear campaign against their adversaries. Over time, opponents of the church, wanting to 
      emulate the Illuminati, began believing the lies and acting them out. Thus, modern Satanism was born.  
      Kohler grunted abruptly.  
      "This is all ancient history. I want to know how this symbol got here." 
      Langdon took a deep breath.  
      "The symbol itself was created by an anonymous sixteenth-century Illuminati artist as a tribute to 
      Galileo's love of symmetry -a kind of sacred Illuminati logo. The brotherhood kept the design secret, 
      allegedly planning to reveal it only when they had amassed enough power to resurface and carry out 
      their final goal." 
      Kohler looked unsettled.   
      "So this symbol means the Illuminati brotherhood is resurfacing?"  
      Langdon frowned. "That would be impossible. There is one chapter of Illuminati history that I have 
      not yet explained." 
      Kohler's voice intensified. "Enlighten me." 
      Langdon rubbed his palms together, mentally sorting through the hundreds of documents he'd read or 
      written on the Illuminati.  
      "The Illuminati were survivors," he explained. "When they fled Rome, they traveled across Europe 
      looking for a safe place to regroup. They were taken in by another secret society... a brotherhood of 
      wealthy Bavarian stone craftsmen called the Freemasons." 
      Kohler looked startled. "The Masons?" 
      Langdon nodded, not at all surprised that Kohler had heard of the group. The brotherhood of the 
      Masons currently had over five million members worldwide, half of them residing in the United States, 
      and over one million of them in Europe. 
      "Certainly the Masons are not satanic," Kohler declared, sounding suddenly skeptical. 
      "Absolutely not. The Masons fell victim of their own benevolence. After harboring the fleeing 
      scientists in the 1700s, the Masons unknowingly became a front for the Illuminati. The Illuminati grew 
      within their ranks, gradually taking over positions of power within the lodges. They quietly 
      reestablished their scientific brotherhood deep within the Masons-a kind of secret society within a 
      secret society. Then the Illuminati used the worldwide connection of Masonic lodges to spread their 
      influence."  
      Langdon drew a cold breath before racing on. "Obliteration of Catholicism was the Illuminati's central 
      covenant. The brotherhood held that the superstitious dogma spewed forth by the church was 
      mankind's greatest enemy. They feared that if religion continued to promote pious myth as absolute 
      fact, scientific progress would halt, and mankind would be doomed to an ignorant future of senseless 
      holy wars."  
      "Much like we see today." 
      Langdon frowned. Kohler was right. Holy wars were still making headlines. My God is better than your 
      God. It seemed there was always close correlation between true believers and high body counts. 
      "Go on," Kohler said. 
      Langdon gathered his thoughts and continued. "The Illuminati grew more powerful in Europe and set 
      their sights on America, a fledgling government many of whose leaders were Masons-George 
      Washington, Ben Franklin-honest, God -fearing men who were unaware of the Illuminati stronghold 
                         23  
      through political and financial means, not through terrorists acts. Furthermore, the Illuminati had a 
      strict code of morality regarding who they saw as enemies. They held men of science in the highest 
      regard. There is no way they would have murdered a fellow scientist like Leonardo Vetra." 
      Kohler's eyes turned to ice. "Perhaps I failed to mention that Leonardo Vetra was anything but an 
      ordinary scientist."  
      Langdon exhaled patiently. "Mr. Kohler, I'm sure Leonardo Vetra was brilliant in many ways, but the 
      fact remains -" 
      Without warning, Kohler spun in his wheelchair and accelerated out of the living room, leaving a wake 
      of swirling mist as he disappeared down a hallway. 
      For the love of God, Langdon groaned. He followed. Kohler was waiting for him in a small alcove at 
      the end of the hallway. 
      "This is Leonardo's study," Kohler said, motioning to the sliding door. "Perhaps when you see it you'll 
      understand things differently." With an awkward grunt, Kohler heaved, and the door slid open. 
      Langdon peered into the study and immediately felt his skin crawl. Holy mother of Jesus, he said to 
      himself.   
                         25  
                           13 
        
       
      Langdon stared in bewilderment at the study before him. "What is this place?" 
      Despite the welcome blast of warm air on his face, he stepped through the door with trepidation. 
      Kohler said nothing as he followed Langdon inside. Langdon scanned the room, not having the 
      slightest idea what to make of it. It contained the most peculiar mix of artifacts he had ever seen. On 
      the far wall, dominating the decor, was an enormous wooden crucifix, which Langdon placed as 
      fourteenth -century Spanish. Above the cruciform, suspended from the ceiling, was a metallic mobile of 
      the orbiting planets. To the left was an oil painting of the Virgin Mary, and beside that was a laminated 
      periodic table of elements. On the side wall, two additional brass cruciforms flanked a poster of Albert 
      Einstein, his famous quote reading, GOD DOES NOT PLAY DICE WITH THE UNIVERSE. 
      Langdon moved into the room, looking around in astonishment. A leather-bound Bible sat on Vetra's 
      desk beside a plastic Bohr model of an atom and a miniature replica of Michelangelo's Moses. 
      Talk about eclectic, Langdon thought. The warmth felt good, but something about the decor sent a 
      new set of chills through his body. He felt like he was witnessing the clash of two philosophical titans... 
      an unsettling blur of opposing forces. He scanned the titles on the bookshelf: The God Particle 
      The Tao of Physics God: The Evidence One of the bookends was etched with a quote: TRUE 
      SCIENCE DISCOVERS GOD WAITING BEHIND EVERY DOOR. -POPE PIUS XII 
      "Leonardo was a Catholic priest," Kohler said. 
      Langdon turned. "A priest? I thought you said he was a physicist." 
      "He was both. Men of science and religion are not unprecedented in history. Leonardo was one of 
      them. He considered physics 'God's natural law.' He claimed God's handwriting was visible in the 
      natural order all around us. Through science he hoped to prove God's existence to the doubting 
      masses. He considered himself a theo-physicist."  
      Theo-physicist? Langdon thought it sounded impossibly oxymoronic. 
      "The field of particle physics," Kohler said, "has made some shocking discoveries lately-discoveries 
      quite spiritual in implication. Leonardo was responsible for many of them." 
      Langdon studied CERN's director, still trying to process the bizarre surroundings. "Spirituality and 
      physics?" Langdon had spent his career studying religious history, and if there was one recurring 
      theme, it was that science and religion had been oil and water since day one... archenemies... unmixable. 
      "Vetra was on the cutting edge of particle physics," Kohler said. "He was starting to fuse science and 
      religion... showing that they complement each other in most unanticipated ways. He called the field 
      New Physics." Kohler pulled a book from the shelf and handed it to Langdon. Langdon studied the 
      cover. God, Miracles, and the New Physics-by Leonardo Vetra.  
      "The field is small," Kohler said, "but it's bringing fresh answers to some old questions-questions about 
      the origin of the universe and the forces that bind us all. Leonardo believed his research had the 
      potential to convert millions to a more spiritual life. Last year he categorically proved the existence of 
      an energy force that unites us all. He actually demonstrated that we are all physically connected... that 
      the molecules in your body are intertwined with the molecules in mine... that there is a single force 
      moving within all of us."  
      Langdon felt disconcerted. And the power of God shall unite us all. "Mr. Vetra actually found a way to 
      demonstrate that particles are connected?"  
      "Conclusive evidence. A recent Scientific American article hailed New Physics as a surer path to God 
      than religion itself." 
      The comment hit home. Langdon suddenly found himself thinking of the antireligious Illuminati. 
      Reluctantly, he forced himself to permit a momentary intellectual foray into the impossible. If the 
      Illuminati were indeed still active, would they have killed Leonardo to stop him from bringing his 
      religious message to the masses? Langdon shook off the thought. Absurd! The Illuminati are ancient 
      history! All academics know that!  
                         27  
                           14 
        
       
      Langdon stepped out of Building C into the open air, grateful to be outside Vetra's flat. The sun helped 
      dissolve the image of the empty eye socket emblazoned into his mind.  
      "This way, please," Kohler said, veering up a steep path. The electric wheelchair seemed to accelerate 
      effortlessly. "Ms. Vetra will be arriving any moment." 
      Langdon hurried to keep up. 
      "So," Kohler as ked. "Do you still doubt the Illuminati's involvement?" 
      Langdon had no idea what to think anymore. Vetra's religious affiliations were definitely troubling, and 
      yet Langdon could not bring himself to abandon every shred of academic evidence he had ever 
      researched. Besides, there was the eye... 
      "I still maintain," Langdon said, more forcefully than he intended. "that the Illuminati are not 
      responsible for this murder. The missing eye is proof." 
      "What?" 
      "Random mutilation," Langdon explained, "is very... un-Illuminati. Cult specialists see desultory 
      defacement from inexperienced fringe sects-zealots who commit random acts of terrorism-but the 
      Illuminati have always been more deliberate." 
      "Deliberate? Surgically removing someone's eyeball is not deliberate?" 
      "It sends no clear message. It serves no higher purpose." 
      Kohler's wheelchair stopped short at the top of the hill. He turned. "Mr. Langdon, believe me, that 
      missing eye does indeed serve a higher purpose... a much higher purpose." 
      As the two men crossed the grassy rise, the beating of helicopter blades became audible to the west. A 
      chopper appeared, arching across the open valley toward them. It banked sharply, then slowed to a 
      hover over a helipad painted on the grass. 
      Langdon watched, detached, his mind churning circles like the blades, wondering if a full night's sleep 
      would make his current disorientation any clearer. Somehow, he doubted it. 
      As the skids touched down, a pilot jumped out and started unloading gear. There was a lot of it-duffels,  
      vinyl wet bags, scuba tanks, and crates of what appeared to be high-tech diving equipment. Langdon 
      was confused.  
      "Is that Ms. Vetra's gear?" he yelled to Kohler over the roar of the engines. 
      Kohler nodded and yelled back, "She was doing biological research in the Balearic Sea." 
      "I thought you said she was a physicist! " 
      "She is. She's a Bio Entanglement Physicist. She studies the interconnectivity of life systems. Her work 
      ties closely with her father's work in particle physics. Recently she disproved one of Einstein's 
      fundamental theories by using atomically synchronized cameras to observe a school of tuna fish." 
      Langdon searched his host's face for any glint of humor. Einstein and tuna fish? He was starting to 
      wonder if the X -33 space plane had mistakenly dropped him off on the wrong planet. A moment later, 
      Vittoria Vetra emerged from the fuselage. Robert Langdon realized today was going to be a day of 
      endless surprises. Descending from the chopper in her khaki shorts and white sleeveless top, Vittoria 
      Vetra looked nothing like the bookish physicist he had expected. Lithe and graceful, she was tall with 
      chestnut skin and long black hair that swirled in the backwind of the rotors. Her face was unmistakably 
      Italian-not overly beautiful, but possessing full, earthy features that even at twenty yards seemed to 
      exude a raw sensuality. As the air currents buffeted her body, her clothes clung, accentuating her 
      slender torso and small breasts.  
      "Ms. Vetra is a woman of tremendous personal strength," Kohler said, seeming to sense Langdon's 
      captivation. "She spends months at a time working in dangerous ecological systems. She is a strict 
      vegetarian and CERN's resident guru of Hatha yoga." 
      Hatha yoga? Langdon mused. The ancient Buddhist art of meditative stretching seemed an odd 
      proficiency for the physicist daughter of a Catholic priest. Langdon watched Vittoria approach. She 
      had obviously been crying, her deep sable eyes filled with emotions Langdon could not place. Still, she 
                         29  
                           15 
        
       
      Langdon strode silently behind Vittoria and Kohler as they moved back into the main atrium where 
      Langdon's bizarre visit had begun. Vittoria's legs drove in fluid efficiency-like an Olympic diver -a 
      potency, Langdon figured, no doubt born from the flexibility and control of yoga. He could hear her 
      breathing slowly and deliberately, as if somehow trying to filter her grief. 
      Langdon wanted to say something to her, offer his sympathy. He too had once felt the abrupt 
      hollowness of unexpectedly losing a parent. He remembered the funeral mostly, rainy and gray. 
      Two days after his twelfth birthday. The house was filled with gray-suited men from the office, men 
      who squeezed his hand too hard when they shook it. They were all mumbling words like cardiac and 
      stress. His mother joked through teary eyes that she'd always been able to follow the stock market 
      simply by holding her husband's hand... his pulse her own private ticker tape. 
      Once, when his father was alive, Langdon had heard his mom begging his father to "stop and smell the 
      roses." That year, Langdon bought his father a tiny blown-glass rose for Christmas. It was the most 
      beautiful thing Langdon had ever seen... the way the sun caught it, throwing a rainbow of colors on the 
      wall. "It's lovel y," his father had said when he opened it, kissing Robert on the forehead. "Let's find a 
      safe spot for it." Then his father had carefully placed the rose on a high dusty shelf in the darkest 
      corner of the living room. A few days later, Langdon got a stool, retrieved the rose, and took it back to 
      the store. His father never noticed it was gone. 
      The ping of an elevator pulled Langdon back to the present. Vittoria and Kohler were in front of him, 
      boarding the lift. Langdon hesitated outside the open doors.  
      "Is something wrong?" Kohler asked, sounding more impatient than concerned. 
      "Not at all," Langdon said, forcing himself toward the cramped carriage. He only used elevators when 
      absolutely necessary. He preferred the more open spaces of stairwells. 
      "Dr. Vetra's lab is subterranean," Kohler said. 
      Wonderful, Langdon thought as he stepped across the cleft, feeling an icy wind churn up from the 
      depths of the shaft. The doors closed, and the car began to descend. 
      "Six stories," Kohler said blankly, like an analytical engine. 
      Langdon pictured the darkness of the empty shaft below them. He tried to block it out by staring at the 
      numbered display of changing floors. Oddly, the elevator showed only two stops. GROUND LEVEL 
      and LHC. 
      "What's LHC stand for?" Langdon asked, trying not to sound nervous. 
      "Large Hadron Collider," Kohler said. "A particle accelerator." 
      Particle accelerator? Langdon was vaguely familiar with the term. He had first heard it over dinner with 
      some colleagues at Dunster House in Cambridge. A physicist friend of theirs, Bob Brownell, had 
      arrived for dinner one night in a rage. 
      "The bastards canceled it!" Brownell cursed. 
      "Canceled what?" they all asked. 
      "The SSC!" 
      "The what?"  
      "The Superconducting Super Collider!" 
      Someone shrugged. "I didn't know Harvard was building one."  
      "Not Harvard!" he exclaimed. "The U.S.! It was going to be the world's most powerful particle 
      accelerator! One of the most important scientific projects of the century! Two billion dollars into it and 
      the Senate sacks the project! Damn Bible-Belt lobbyists!"  
      When Brownell finally calmed down, he explained that a particle accelerator was a large, circular tube 
      through which subatomic particles were accelerated. Magnets in the tube turned on and off in rapid 
      succession to "push" particles around and around until they reached tremendous velocities. Fully 
      accelerated particles circled the tube at over 180,000 miles per second.  
      "But that's almost the speed of light," one of the professors exclaimed. 
                         31  
                           16 
        
       
      Hundreds of miles from CERN, a voice crackled through a walkie-talkie. "Okay, I'm in the hallway." 
      The technician monitoring the video screens pressed the button on his transmitter. "You're looking for 
      camera #86. It's supposed to be at the far end." 
      There was a long silence on the radio. The waiting technician broke a light sweat. Finally his radio 
      clicked. 
      "The camera isn't here," the voice said. "I can see where it was mounted, though. Somebody must have 
      removed it."  
      The techn ician exhaled heavily. "Thanks. Hold on a second, will you?" 
      Sighing, he redirected his attention to the bank of video screens in front of him. Huge portions of the 
      complex were open to the public, and wireless cameras had gone missing before, usually stolen by 
      visiting pranksters looking for souvenirs. But as soon as a camera left the facility and was out of range, 
      the signal was lost, and the screen went blank. Perplexed, the technician gazed up at the monitor. A 
      crystal clear image was still coming from camera #86. If the camera was stolen, he wondered, why are 
      we still getting a signal? He knew, of course, there was only one explanation. The camera was still 
      inside the complex, and someone had simply moved it. But who? And why? 
      He studied the monitor a l ong moment. Finally he picked up his walkie-talkie. 
      "Are there any closets in that stairwell? Any cupboards or dark alcoves?" 
      The voice replying sounded confused. "No. Why?" 
      The technician frowned. "Never mind. Thanks for your help." He turned off his walkie-talkie and 
      pursed his lips. 
      Considering the small size of the video camera and the fact that it was wireless, the technician knew 
      that camera #86 could be transmitting from just about anywhere within the heavily guarded 
      compound-a densely packed collection of thirty-two separate buildings covering a half -mile radius. The 
      only clue was that the camera seemed to have been placed somewhere dark. Of course, that wasn't 
      much help. The complex contained endless dark locations-maintenance closets, heating ducts, 
      gardening sheds, bedroom wardrobes, even a labyrinth of underground tunnels. Camera #86 could 
      take weeks to locate. But that's the least of my problems, he thought.  
      Despite the dilemma posed by the camera's relocation, there was another far more unsettling matter at 
      hand. The technician gazed up at the image the lost camera was transmitting. It was a stationary object. 
      A modern-looking device like nothing the technician had ever seen. He studied the blinking electronic 
      display at its base.  
      Although the guard had undergone rigorous training preparing him for tense situations, he still sensed 
      his pulse rising. He told himself not to panic. There had to be an explanation. The object appeared too 
      small to be of significant danger. Then again, its presence inside the complex was troubling. Very 
      troubling, indeed. Today of all days, he thought. Security was always a top priority for his employer, but 
      today, more than any other day in the past twelve years, security was of the utmost importance. The 
      technician st ared at the object for a long time and sensed the rumblings of a distant gathering storm. 
      Then, sweating, he dialed his superior.  
                         33  
      Father Leonardo told her.  
      Vittoria hugged him for five minutes, crying tears of joy. "Oh yes! Yes!" 
      Leonardo told her he had to leave for a while and get their new home settled in Switzerland, but he 
      promised to send for her in six months. It was the longest wait of Vittoria's life, but Leonardo kept his 
      word. Five days before her ninth birthday, Vittoria moved to Geneva. She attended Geneva 
      International School during the day and learned from her father at night. 
      Three years later Leonardo Vetra was hired by CERN. Vittoria and Leonardo relocated to a 
      wonderland the likes of which the young Vittoria had never imagined. 
      Vittoria Vetra's body felt numb as she strode down the LHC tunnel. She saw her muted reflection in 
      the LHC and sensed her father's absence. Normally she existed in a state of deep calm, in harmony 
      with the world around her. But now, very suddenly, nothing made sense. The last three hours had been 
      a blur. It had been 10 A.M. in the Balearic Islands when Kohler's call came through. Your father has 
      been murdered. Come home immediately. Despite the sweltering heat on the deck of the dive boat, the 
      words had chilled her to the bone, Kohler's emotionless tone hurting as much as the news. Now she 
      had returned home. But home to what? CERN, her world since she was twelve, seemed suddenly 
      foreign. Her father, the man who had made it magical, was gone. 
      Deep breaths, she told herself, but she couldn't calm her mind. The questions circled faster and faster. 
      Who killed her father? And why? Who was this American "specialist"? Why was Kohler insisting on 
      seeing the lab?  
      Kohler had said there was evidence that her father's murder was related to the current project. What 
      evidence? Nobody knew what we were working on! And even if someone found out, why would they 
      kill him?  
      As she moved down the LHC tunnel toward her father's lab, Vittoria realized she was about to unveil 
      her father's greatest achievement without him there. She had pictured this moment much differently. 
      She had imagined her father calling CERN's top scientists to his lab, showing them his discovery, 
      watching their awestruck faces. Then he would beam with fatherly pride as he explained to them how it 
      had been one of Vittoria's ideas that had helped him make the project a reality... that his daughter had 
      been integral in his breakthrough. Vittoria felt a lump in her throat. My father and I were supposed 
      to share this moment together. But here she was alone. No colleagues. No happy faces. Just an 
      American stranger and Maximilian Kohler. Maximilian Kohler. Der K��nig. 
      Even as a child, Vittoria had disliked the man. Although she eventually came to respect his potent 
      intellect, his icy demeanor always seemed inhuman, the exact antithesis of her father's warmth. Kohler 
      pursued science for its immaculate logic... her father for its spiritual wonder. And yet oddly there had 
      always seemed to be an unspoken respect between the two men. Genius, someone had once explained 
      to her, accepts genius unconditionally. Genius, she thought. My father... Dad. Dead. 
      The entry to Leonardo Vetra's lab was a long sterile hallway paved entirely in white tile. Langdon felt 
      like he was entering some kind of underground insane asylum. Lining the corridor were dozens of 
      framed,  black-and-white images. Although Langdon had made a career of studying images, these were 
      entirely alien to him. They looked like chaotic negatives of random streaks and spirals. Modern art? he 
      mused. Jackson Pollock on amphetamines? 
      "Scatter plots," Vittoria said, apparently noting Langdon's interest. "Computer representations of 
      particle collisions. That's the Z -particle," she said, pointing to a faint track that was almost invisible in 
      the confusion. "My father discovered it five years ago. Pure energy-no mass at all. It may well be the 
      smallest building block in nature. Matter is nothing but trapped energy." 
      Matter is energy? Langdon cocked his head. Sounds pretty Zen. He gazed at the tiny streak in the 
      photograph and wondered what his buddies in the Harvard physics department would say when he 
      told them he'd spent the weekend hanging out in a Large Hadron Collider admiring Z-particles. 
      "Vittoria," Kohler said, as they approached the lab's imposing steel door, "I should mention that I 
      came down here this morning looking for your father." 
      Vittoria flushed slightly. "You did?" 
      "Yes. And imagine my surprise when I discovered he had replaced CERN's standard keypad security 
      with something else." Kohler motioned to an intricate electronic device mounted beside the door. 
                         35  
                           18 
        
       
       
      The woman's hands were tied, her wrists now purple and swollen from chafing. The mahogany-
      skinned Hassassin lay beside her, spent, admiring his naked prize. He wondered if her current slumber 
      was just a deception, a pathetic attempt to avoid further service to him. He did not care. He had reaped 
      sufficient reward. Sated, he sat up in bed. In his country women were possessions. Weak. Tools of 
      pleasure. Chattel to be traded like livestock. And they understood their place. But here, in Europe, 
      women feigned a strength and independence that both amused and excited him. Forcing them into 
      physical submission was a gratification he always enjoyed. 
      Now, despite the contentment in his loins, the Hassassin sensed another appetite growing within him. 
      He had killed last night, killed and mutilated, and for him killing was like heroin... each encounter 
      satisfying only temporarily before increasing his longing for more. The exhilaration had worn off. The 
      craving had returned.  
      He studied the sleeping woman beside him. Running his palm across her neck, he felt aroused with the 
      knowledge that he could end her life in an instant. What would it matter? She was subhuman, a vehicle 
      only of pleasure and service. His strong fingers encircled her throat, savoring her delicate pulse. Then, 
      fighting desire, he removed his hand. There was work to do. Service to a higher cause than his own 
      desire. 
      As he got out of bed, he reveled in the honor of the job before him. He still could not fathom the 
      influence of this man named Janus and the ancient brotherhood he commanded. Wondrously, the 
      brotherhood had chosen him. Somehow they had learned of his loathing... and of his skills. How, he 
      would never know. Their roots reach wide. Now they had bestowed on him the ultimate honor. He 
      would be their hands and their voice. Their assassin and their messenger. The one his people knew as 
      Malak al -haq-the Angel of Truth.  
                         37  
      scientifically absurd.  
      "Mr. Langdon," Vittoria said, turning, "I assume you are familiar with the Big Bang Theory?" 
      Langdon shrugged. "More or less." The Big Bang, he knew, was the scientifically accepted model for 
      the creation of the universe. He didn't really understand it, but according to the theory, a single point 
      of intensely focused energy erupted in a cataclysmic explosion, expanding outward to form the 
      universe. Or something like that.  
      Vittoria continued. "When the Catholic Church first proposed the Big Bang Theory in 1927, the-" 
      "I'm sorry?" Langdon interrupted, before he could stop himself. "You say the Big Bang was a Catholic 
      idea?" 
      Vittoria looked surprised by his question "Of course. Proposed by a Catholic monk, Georges Lema��tre 
      in 1927."  
      "But, I thought..." he hesitated. "Wasn't the Big Bang proposed by Harvard astronomer Edwin 
      Hubble?" 
      Kohler glowered. "Again, American scientific arrogance. Hubble published in 1929, two years after 
      Lema�� tre." 
      Langdon scowled. It's called the Hubble Telescope, sir-I've never heard of any Lema��tre Telescope! 
      "Mr. Kohler is right," Vittoria said, "the idea belonged to Lema��tre. Hubble only confirmed it by 
      gathering the hard evidence that proved the Big Bang was scientifically probable." 
      "Oh," Langdon said, wondering if the Hubble-fanatics in the Harvard Astronomy Department ever 
      mentioned Lema��tre in their lectures. 
      "When Lema��tre first proposed the Big Bang Theory," Vittoria continued, "scientists claimed it was 
      utterly ridiculous. Matter, science said, could not be created out of nothing. So, when Hubble shocked 
      the world by scientifically proving the Big Bang was accurate, the church claimed victory, heralding this 
      as proof that the Bible was scientifically accurate. The divine truth." 
      Langdon nodded, focusing intently now. 
      "Of course scientists did not appreciate having their discoveries used by the church to promote 
      religion, so they immediately mathematicized the Big Bang Theory, removed all religious overtones, 
      and claimed it as their own. Unfortunately for science, however, their equations, even today, have one 
      serious deficiency that the church likes to point out." 
      Kohler grunted. "The singularity." He spoke the word as if it were the bane of his existence. 
      "Yes, the singularity," Vittoria said. "The exact moment of creation. Time zero." She looked at 
      Langdon.  
      "Even today, science cannot grasp the initial moment of creation. Our equations explain the early 
      universe quite effectively, but as we move back in time, approaching time zero, suddenly our 
      mathematics disintegrates, and everything becomes meaningless." 
      "Correct," Kohler said, his voice edgy, "and the church holds up this deficiency as proof of God's 
      miraculous involvement. Come to your point." 
      Vittoria's expression became distant. "My point is that my father had always believed in God's 
      involvement in the Big Bang. Even though science was unable to comprehend the divine moment of 
      creation, he believed someday it would." She motioned sadly to a laser-printed memo tacked over her 
      father's work area. "My dad used to wave that in my face every time I had doubts." 
      Langdon read the message: SCIENCE AND RELIGION ARE NOT AT ODDS. SCIENCE IS 
      SIMPLY TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND.  
      "My dad wanted to bring science to a higher level," Vittoria said, "where science supported the concept 
      of God." She ran a hand through her long hair, looking melancholy. "He set out to do something no 
      scientist had ever thought to do. Something that no one has ever had the technology to do." She 
      paused, as though uncertain how to speak the next words. "He designed an experiment to prove 
      Genesis was possible." 
      Prove Genesis? Langdon wondered. Let there be light? Matter from nothing? Kohler's dead gaze bore 
      across the room. "I beg your pardon?" 
      "My father created a universe... from nothing at all." 
      Kohler snapped his head around. "What!" 
      "Better said, he recreated the Big Bang." 
                         39  
                           20 
        
       
      Phase two, the Hassassin thought, striding into the darkened tunnel. The torch in his hand was overkill. 
      He knew that. But it was for effect. Effect was everything. Fear, he had learned, was his ally. Fear 
      cripples faster than any implement of war. 
      There was no mirror in the passage to admire his disguise, but he could sense from the shadow of his 
      billowing robe that he was perfect. Blending in was part of the plan... part of the depravity of the plot. 
      In his wildest dreams he had never imagined playing this part.  
      Two weeks ago, he would have considered the task awaiting him at the far end of this tunnel 
      impossible. A suicide mission. Walking naked into a lion's lair. But Janus had changed the definition of 
      impossible. The secrets Janus had shared with the Hassassin in the last two weeks had been 
      numerous... this very tunnel being one of them. Ancient, and yet still perfectly passable. 
      As he drew closer to his enemy, the Hassassin wondered if what awaited him inside would be as easy as 
      Janus had promised. Ja nus had assured him someone on the inside would make the necessary 
      arrangements.   
      Someone on the inside. Incredible. The more he considered it, the more he realized it was child's play. 
      Wahad... tintain... thalatha... arbaa, he said to himself in Arabic as he neared the end. One... two... 
      three... four... 
                         41  
      Kohler returned his gaze to the canister before him. With a look of uncertainty, he hoisted himself in 
      his chair and placed his eye to the viewer, peering inside. He stared a long time without saying 
      anything. When he finally sat down, his forehead was covered with sweat. The lines on his face 
      had disappeared. His voice was a whisper. "My God... you really did it." 
      Vittoria nodded. "My father did it."  
      "I... I don't know what to say." 
      Vittoria turned to Langdon. "Would you like a look?" She motioned to the viewing device.  
      Uncertain what to expect, Langdon moved forward. From two feet away, the canister appeared empty. 
      Whatever was inside was infinitesimal. Langdon placed his eye to the viewer. It took a moment for the 
      image before him to come into focus. Then he saw it. The object was not on the bottom of the 
      container as he expected, but rather it was floating in the centersuspended in midair-a shimmering 
      globule of mercurylike liquid. Hovering as if by magic, the liquid tumbled in space. Metallic wavelets 
      rippled across the droplet's surface. The suspended fluid reminded Langdon of a video he had once 
      seen of a water droplet in zero G. Although he knew the globule was microscopic, he could see every 
      changing gorge and undulation as the ball of plasma rolled slowly in suspension. 
      "It's... floating," he said. 
      "It had better be," Vittoria replied. "Antimatter is highly unstable. Energetically speaking, antimatter is 
      the mirror image of matter, so the two instantly cancel each other out if they come in contact. Keeping 
      antimatter isolated from matter is a challenge, of course, because everything on earth is made of matter. 
      The samples have to be stored without ever touching anything at all-even air."  
      Langdon was amazed. Talk about working in a vacuum. 
      "These anti matter traps?" Kohler interrupted, looking amazed as he ran a pallid finger around one's 
      base.   
      "They are your father's design?" 
      "Actually," she said, "they are mine." 
      Kohler looked up. Vittoria's voice was unassuming.  
      "My father produced the first particles of antimatter but was stymied by how to store them. I suggested 
      these. Airtight nanocomposite shells with opposing electromagnets at each end." 
      "It seems your father's genius has rubbed off." 
      "Not really. I borrowed the idea from nature. Portuguese man-o'-wars trap fish between their tentacles 
      using nematocystic charges. Same principle here. Each canister has two electromagnets, one at each 
      end. Their opposing magnetic fields intersect in the center of the canister and hold the antimatter 
      there, suspend ed in midvacuum."  
      Langdon looked again at the canister. Antimatter floating in a vacuum, not touching anything at all. 
      Kohler was right. It was genius. 
      "Where's the power source for the magnets?" Kohler asked. 
      Vittoria pointed. "In the pillar beneath the trap. The canisters are screwed into a docking port that 
      continuously recharges them so the magnets never fail." 
      "And if the field fails?"  
      "The obvious. The antimatter falls out of suspension, hits the bottom of the trap, and we see an 
      annihilation." 
      Langdon's ears pricked up. "Annihilation?" He didn't like the sound of it. 
      Vittoria looked unconcerned. "Yes. If antimatter and matter make contact, both are destroyed 
      instantly. Physicists call the process 'annihilation.' " 
      Langdon nodded. "Oh." 
      "It is nature's simplest reaction. A particle of matter and a particle of antimatter combine to release two 
      new particles -called photons. A photon is effectively a tiny puff of light." 
      Langdon had read about photons-light particles-the purest form of energy. He decided to refrain from  
      asking about Captain Kirk's use of photon torpedoes against the Klingons.  
      "So if the antimatter falls, we see a tiny puff of light?" 
      Vittoria shrugged. "Depends what you call tiny. Here, let me demonstrate." She reached for the 
      canister and  started to unscrew it from its charging podium. 
                         43  
                           22 
        
       
      Kohler, incredibly, was standing for a moment, teetering on two withered legs. His face was white with 
      fear. "Vittoria! You can't remove that trap!" 
      Langdon watched, bewildered by the director's sudden panic. 
      "Five hundred nanograms!" Kohler said. "If you break the magnetic field-" 
      "Director," Vittoria assured, "it's perfectly safe. Every trap has a failsafe-a back-up battery in case it is 
      removed from its recharger. The specimen remains suspended even if I remove the canister." 
      Kohler looked uncertain. Then, hesitantly, he settled back into his chair. 
      "The batteries activate automatically," Vittoria said, "when the trap is moved from the recharger. They 
      work for twenty -four hours. Like a reserve tank of gas." She turned to Langdon, 
      as if sensing his discomfort. "Antimatter has some astonishing characteristics, Mr. Langdon, which 
      make it quite dangerous. A ten milligram sample-the volume of a grain of sand-is hypothesized to hold 
      as much energy as about two hundred metric tons of conventional rocket fuel." 
      Langdon's head was spinning again. 
      "It is the energy source of tomorrow. A thousand times more powerful than nuclear energy. One 
      hundred percent efficient. No byproducts. No radiation. No pollution. A few grams could power a 
      major city for a week." 
      Grams? Langdon stepped uneasily back from the podium. "Don't worry," Vittoria said. "These samples 
      are minuscule fractions of a gram-millionths. Relatively harmless." She reached for the canister again 
      and twisted it from its docking platform. 
      Kohler twitched but did not interfere. As the trap came free, there was a sharp beep, and a small LED 
      display activated near the base of the trap. The red digits blinked, counting down from twenty-four 
      hours. 
      24:00:00... 
      23:59:59... 
      23:59:58... 
      Langdon studied the descending counter and decided it looked unsettlingly like a time bomb. 
      "The battery," Vitto ria explained, "will run for the full twenty-four hours before dying. It can be 
      recharged by placing the trap back on the podium. It's designed as a safety measure, but it's also 
      convenient for transport." 
      "Transport?" Kohler looked thunderstruck. "You take this stuff out of the lab?" 
      "Of course not," Vittoria said. "But the mobility allows us to study it." 
      Vittoria led Langdon and Kohler to the far end of the room. She pulled a curtain aside to reveal a 
      window, beyond which was a large room. The walls, floors, and ceiling were entirely plated in steel. 
      The room reminded Langdon of the holding tank of an oil freighter he had once taken to Papua New 
      Guinea to study Hanta body graffiti. 
      "It's an annihilation tank," Vittoria declared. 
      Kohler looked up. "You actually observe annihilations?"  
      "My father was fascinated with the physics of the Big Bang-large amounts of energy from minuscule 
      kernels of matter." Vittoria pulled open a steel drawer beneath the window. She placed the trap inside 
      the drawer and closed it. Then she pulled a lever beside the drawer. A moment later, the trap appeared 
      on the other side of the glass, rolling smoothly in a wide arc across the metal floor until it came to a 
      stop near the center of the room. 
      Vittoria gave a tight smile. "You're about to witness your first antimatter-matter annihilation. A few  
      millionths of a gram. A relatively minuscule specimen." 
      Langdon looked out at the antimatter trap sitting alone on the floor of the enormous tank. Kohler also 
      turned toward the window, looking uncertain.  
      "Normally," Vittoria explained, "we'd have to wait the full twenty-four hours until the batteries died, 
      but this chamber contains magnets beneath the floor that can override the trap, pulling the antimatter 
      out of suspension. And when the matter and antimatter touch..." 
                         45  
                           23 
        
       
      Kohler was staring into the annihilation chamber with a look of utter amazement at the spectacle he 
      had just seen. Robert Langdon was beside him, looking even more dazed.  
      "I want to see my father," Vittoria demanded. "I showed you the lab. Now I want to see my father." 
      Kohler turned slowly, apparently not hearing her. "Why did you wait so long, Vittoria? You and your 
      father should have told me about this discovery immediately." 
      Vittoria stared at him. How many reasons do you want? "Director, we can argue about this later. Right 
      now, I want to see my father." 
      "Do you know what this technology implies?" 
      "Sure," Vittoria shot back. "Revenue for CERN. A lot of it. Now I want-" 
      "Is that why you kept it secret?" Kohler demanded, clearly baiting her. "Because you feared the board 
      and I would vote to license it out?" 
      "It should be licensed," Vittoria fired back, feeling herself dragged into the argument. "Antimatter is 
      important technology. But it's also dangerous. My father and I wanted time to refine the procedures 
      and make it safe." 
      "In other words, you didn't trust the board of directors to place prudent science before financial 
      greed." 
      Vittoria was surprised with the indifference in Kohler's ton e. "There were other issues as well," she 
      said. 
      "My father wanted time to present antimatter in the appropriate light." 
      "Meaning?"  
      What do you think I mean? "Matter from energy? Something from nothing? It's practically proof that 
      Genesis is a scientific possibility." 
      "So he didn't want the religious implications of his discovery lost in an onslaught of commercialism?" 
      "In a manner of speaking." 
      "And you?" 
      Vittoria's concerns, ironically, were somewhat the opposite. Commercialism was critical for the success 
      of any new energy source. Although antimatter technology had staggering potential as an efficient and 
      nonpolluting energy source -if unveiled prematurely, antimatter ran the risk of being vilified by the 
      politics and PR fiascoes that had killed nuclear and solar power. Nuclear had proliferated before it was 
      safe, and there were accidents. Solar had proliferated before it was efficient, and people lost money. 
      Both technologies got bad reputations and withered on the vine. 
      "My interests," Vittoria said, "were  a bit less lofty than uniting science and religion." 
      "The environment," Kohler ventured assuredly. 
      "Limitless energy. No strip mining. No pollution. No radiation. Antimatter technology could save the 
      planet." 
      "Or destroy it," Kohler quipped. "Depending on who uses it for what." Vittoria felt a chill emanating 
      from Kohler's crippled form. "Who else knew about this?" he asked. 
      "No one," Vittoria said. "I told you that." 
      "Then why do you think your father was killed?" 
      Vittoria's muscles tightened. "I have no idea. He had enemies here at CERN, you know that, but it 
      couldn't have had anything to do with antimatter. We swore to each other to keep it between us for 
      another few months, until we were ready." 
      "And you're certain your father kept his vow of silence?" 
      Now Vittoria was getting mad. "My father has kept tougher vows than that!" 
      "And you told no one?"  
      "Of course not!"  
      Kohler exhaled. He paused, as though choosing his next words carefully. "Suppose someone did find 
      out. And suppose someone gained access to this lab. What do you imagine they would be after? Did 
      your father have notes down here? Documentation of his processes?" 
                         47  
      "Yes. A second retina-scan."  
      Kohler spoke only two words. "Downstairs. Now." 
      The freight elevator dropped like a rock. Another seventy-five feet into the earth. Vittoria was certain 
      she sensed fear in both men as the elevator fell deeper. Kohler's usually emotionless face was taut. I 
      know, Vittoria thought, the sample is enormous, but the precautions we've taken are- 
      They reached the bottom. 
      The elevator opened, and Vittoria led the way down the dimly lit corridor. Up ahead the corridor 
      deadended at a huge steel door. HAZ-MAT. The retina scan device beside the door was identical to the 
      one upstairs. She approached. Carefully, she aligned her eye with the lens. She pulled back. Something 
      was wrong. The usually spotless lens was spattered... smeared with something that looked like... blood? 
      Confused she turned to the two men, but her gaze met waxen faces. 
      Both Kohler and Langdon were white, their eyes fixed on the floor at her feet. Vittoria followed their 
      line of sight... down. 
      "No!" Langdon yelled, reaching for her. But it was too late. 
      Vittoria's vision locked on the object on the floor. It was both utterly foreign and intimately familiar to 
      her. It took only an instant. Then, with a reeling horror, she knew. Staring up at her from the floor, 
      discarded like a piece of trash, was an eyeball. She would have recognized that shade of hazel 
      anywhere.  
                         49  
                           25 
        
       
      Haz-Mat. Fifty meters below ground. Vittoria Vetra stumbled forward, almost falling into the retina 
      scan. She sensed the American rushing to help her, holding her, supporting her weight. On the floor at 
      her feet, her father's eyeball stared up. She felt the air crushed from her lungs. They cut out his eye! 
      Her world twisted. Kohler pressed close behind, speaking. Langdon guided her. As if in a dream, she 
      found herself gazing into the retina scan. The mechanism beeped. 
      The door slid open. 
      Even with the terror of her father's eye boring into her soul, Vittoria sensed an additional horror 
      awaited inside. When she leveled her blurry gaze into the room, she confirmed the next chapter of the 
      nightmare. 
      Before her, the solitary recharging podium was empty. The canister was gone. They had cut out her 
      father's eye to steal it. The implications came too fast for her to fully comprehend. Everything had 
      backfired. The specimen that was supposed to prove antimatter was a safe and viable energy source 
      had been stolen. But nobody knew this specimen even existed! The truth, however, was undeniable. 
      Someone had found out. Vittoria could not imagine who. 
      Even Kohler, whom they said knew everything at CERN, clearly had no idea about the project. Her 
      father was dead. Murdered for his genius. 
      As the grief strafed her heart, a new emotion surged into Vittoria's conscious. This one was far worse. 
      Crushing. Stabbing at her. The emotion was guilt. Uncontrollable, relentless guilt. Vittoria knew it had 
      been she who convinced her father to create the specimen. Against his better judgment. And he had 
      been killed for it. 
      A quarter of a gram...  
      Like any technology-fire, gunpowder, the combustion engine-in the wrong hands, antimatter could be 
      deadly. Very deadly. Antimatter was a lethal weapon. Potent, and unstoppable. Once removed from its 
      recharging platform at CERN, the canister would count down inexorably. A runaway train. 
      And when time ran out... 
      A blinding light. The roar of thunder. Spontaneous incineration. Just the flash... and an empty crater. A 
      big empty crater.   
      The image of her father's quiet genius being used as a tool of destruction was like poison in her blood. 
      Antimatter was the ultimate terrorist weapon. It had no metallic parts to trip metal detectors, no  
      chemical signature for dogs to trace, no fuse to deactivate if the authorities located the canister. The 
      countdown had begun... 
      Langdon didn't know what else to do. He took his handkerchief and lay it on the floor over Leonardo 
      Vetra's eyeball. Vittoria was standing now in the doorway of the empty Haz-Mat chamber, her 
      expression wrought with grief and panic. Langdon moved toward her again, instinctively, but Kohler 
      intervened.  
      "Mr. Langdon?" Kohler's face was expressionless. He motioned Langdon out of earshot. Langdon 
      reluctantly followed, leaving Vittoria to fend for herself. "You're the specialist," Kohler said, his 
      whisper intense. "I want to know what these Illuminati bastards intend to do with this antimatter." 
      Langdon tried to focus. Despite the madness around him, his first reaction was logical. Academic 
      rejection. 
      Kohler was still making assumptions. Impossible assumptions. "The Illuminati are defunct, Mr. 
      Kohler. I stand by that. This crime could be anything-maybe even another CERN employee who 
      found out about Mr. Vetra's breakthrough and thought the project was too dangerous to continue." 
      Kohler looked stunned. "You think this is a crime of conscience, Mr. Langdon? Absurd. Whoever 
      killed Leonardo wanted one thing-the antimatter specimen. And no doubt they have plans for it." 
      "You mean terrorism."  
      "Plainly." 
      "But the Illuminati were not terrorists." 
      "Tell that to Leonardo Vetra." 
                         51  
      because it was her father who had sworn them both to secrecy, or she and her father had been 
      monitored. The cell phone maybe? She knew they had spoken a few times while Vittoria was traveling. 
      Had they said too much? It was possible. There was also their E-mail. But they had been discreet, 
      hadn't they? CERN's security s ystem? Had they been monitored somehow without their knowledge? 
      She knew none of that mattered anymore. What was done, was done. My father is dead. 
      The thought spurred her to action. She pulled her cell phone from her shorts pocket. Kohler 
      accelerated towa rd her, coughing violently, eyes flashing anger. "Who... are you calling?" 
      "CERN's switchboard. They can connect us to Interpol." 
      "Think!" Kohler choked, screeching to a halt in front of her. "Are you really so na��ve? That canister 
      could be anywhere in the world by now. No intelligence agency on earth could possibly mobilize to 
      find it in time." 
      "So we do nothing?" Vittoria felt compunction challenging a man in such frail health, but the director 
      was so far out of line she didn't even know him anymore. 
      "We do what is smart," Kohler said. "We don't risk CERN's reputation by involving authorities who 
      cannot help anyway. Not yet. Not without thinking." 
      Vittoria knew there was logic somewhere in Kohler's argument, but she also knew that logic, by 
      definition, was  bereft of moral responsibility. Her father had lived for moral responsibility-careful 
      science, accountability, faith in man's inherent goodness. Vittoria believed in those things too, but she 
      saw them in terms of karma. Turning away from Kohler, she snapped open her phone. 
      "You can't do that," he said. 
      "Just try and stop me." 
      Kohler did not move.  
      An instant later, Vittoria realized why. This far underground, her cell phone had no dial tone. 
      Fuming, she headed for the elevator. 
                         53  
                           27 
        
       
      Vittoria, I will not allow it!" Kohler's breath was labored and getting worse as the Haz-Mat elevator 
      ascended.  
      Vittoria blocked him out. She craved sanctuary, something familiar in this place that no longer felt like 
      home. She knew it was not to be. Right now, she had to swallow the pain and act. 
      Get to a phone. 
      Robert Langdon was beside her, silent as usual. Vittoria had given up wondering who the man was. A 
      specialist? Could Kohler be any less specific? Mr. Langdon can help us find your father's killer. 
      Langdon was being no help at all. His warmth and kindness seemed genuine, but he was clearly hiding 
      something.  
      They both were. 
      Kohler was at her again. "As director of CERN, I have a responsibility to the future of science. If you 
      amplify this into an int ernational incident and CERN suffers -" 
      "Future of science?" Vittoria turned on him. "Do you really plan to escape accountability by never 
      admitting this antimatter came from CERN? Do you plan to ignore the people's lives we've put in 
      danger?" 
      "Not we," Koh ler countered. "You. You and your father." 
      Vittoria looked away. 
      "And as far as endangering lives," Kohler said, "life is exactly what this is about. You know antimatter 
      technology has enormous implications for life on this planet. If CERN goes bankrupt, destroyed by 
      scandal, everybody loses. Man's future is in the hands of places like CERN, scientists like you and your 
      father, working to solve tomorrow's problems." 
      Vittoria had heard Kohler's Science-as-God lecture before, and she never bought it. Science itself 
      caused half the problems it was trying to solve. "Progress" was Mother Earth's ultimate malignancy. 
      "Scientific advancement carries risk," Kohler argued. "It always has. Space programs, genetic research, 
      medicine-they all make mistakes. Science needs to survive its own blunders, at any cost. For everyone's 
      sake."  
      Vittoria was amazed at Kohler's ability to weigh moral issues with scientific detachment. His intellect 
      seemed to be the product of an icy divorce from his inner spirit. "You think CERN is so critical to the 
      earth's future that we should be immune from moral responsibility?" 
      "Do not argue morals with me. You crossed a line when you made that specimen, and you have put 
      this entire facility at risk. I'm trying to protect not only the jobs of the three thousand scientists who 
      work here, but also your father's reputation. Think about him. A man like your father does not deserve 
      to be remembered as the creator of a weapon of mass destruction." 
      Vittoria felt his spear hit home. I am the one who convinced my father to create that specimen. This is 
      my fault! 
      When the door opened, Kohler was still talking. Vittoria stepped out of the elevator, pulled out her 
      phone, and tried again. 
      Still no dial tone. Damn! She headed for the door.  
      "Vittoria, stop." Th e director sounded asthmatic now, as he accelerated after her. "Slow down. We 
      need to talk."  
      "Basta di parlare!"  
      "Think of your father," Kohler urged. "What would he do?" 
      She kept going.  
      "Vittoria, I haven't been totally honest with you." 
      Vittoria felt her legs slow.  
      "I don't know what I was thinking," Kohler said. "I was just trying to protect you. Just tell me what you 
      want. We need to work together here." 
      Vittoria came to a full stop halfway across the lab, but she did not turn. "I want to find the antimatter. 
      And I want to know who killed my father." She waited. 
                         55  
                           28 
        
       
      Secretary Sylvie Baudeloque was now in a panic. She paced outside the director's empty office. Where 
      the hell is he? What do I do? 
      It had been a bizarre da y. Of course, any day working for Maximilian Kohler had the potential to be 
      strange, but Kohler had been in rare form today. 
      "Find me Leonardo Vetra!" he had demanded when Sylvie arrived this morning. 
      Dutifully, Sylvie paged, phoned, and E-mailed Leonardo  Vetra. Nothing. So Kohler had left in a huff, 
      apparently to go find Vetra himself. When he rolled back in a few hours later, Kohler looked decidedly 
      not well... not that he ever actually looked well, but he looked worse than usual. He locked himself in 
      his office, and she could hear him on his modem, his phone, faxing, talking. Then Kohler rolled out 
      again. He hadn't been back since. 
      Sylvie had decided to ignore the antics as yet another Kohlerian melodrama, but she began to get 
      concerned when Kohler failed to return at the proper time for his daily injections; the director's 
      physical condition required regular treatment, and when he decided to push his luck, the results were 
      never pretty-respiratory shock, coughing fits, and a mad dash by the infirmary personnel. Sometimes 
      Sylvie thought Maximilian Kohler had a death wish. 
      She considered paging him to remind him, but she'd learned charity was something Kohlers's pride 
      despised. Last week, he had become so enraged with a visiting scientist who had shown him undue pity 
      that Kohler clambered to his feet and threw a clipboard at the man's head. King Kohler could be 
      surprisingly agile when he was piss��. 
      At the moment, however, Sylvie's concern for the director's health was taking a back burner... replaced 
      by a much more pressing dilemma. The CERN switchboard had phoned five minutes ago in a frenzy 
      to say they had an urgent call for the director. 
      "He's not available," Sylvie had said. 
      Then the CERN operator told her who was calling. 
      Sylvie half laughed aloud. "You're kidding, right?" She listened, and her face clouded with disbelief. 
      "And your caller ID confirms -" Sylvie was frowning. "I see. Okay. Can you ask what the-" She sighed. 
      "No. That's fine. Tell him to hold. I'll locate the director right away. Yes, I understand. I'll hurry." 
      But Sylvie had not been able to find the director. She had called his cell line three times and each time 
      gotten the same message: "The mobile customer you are trying to reach is out of range." Out of range? 
      How far could he go? So Sylv ie had dialed Kohler's beeper. Twice. No response. Most unlike him. 
      She'd even E -mailed his mobile computer. Nothing. It was like the man had disappeared off the face of 
      the earth. So what do I do? she now wondered. Short of searching CERN's entire complex herself, 
      Sylvie knew there was only one other way to get the director's attention. He would not be pleased, but 
      the man on the phone was not someone the director should keep waiting. Nor did it sound like the 
      caller was in any mood to be told the director was unavailable.  
      Startled with her own boldness, Sylvie made her decision. She walked into Kohler's office and went to 
      the metal box on his wall behind his desk. She opened the cover, stared at the controls, and found the 
      correct button.  
      Then she took a deep breath and grabbed the microphone. 
                         57  
                           30 
        
       
      "Maximilian Kohler. Kindly call your office immediately." 
      Blazing sunbeams flooded Langdon's eyes as the elevator doors opened into the main atrium. Before 
      the echo of the announcement on the intercom overhead faded, every electronic device on Kohler's 
      wheelchair started beeping and buzzing simultaneously. His pager. His phone. His E-mail. 
      Kohler glanced down at the blinking lights in apparent bewilderment. The director had resurfaced, and 
      he was back in range. 
      "Director Kohler. Please call your office." 
      The sound of his name on the PA seemed to startle Kohler. 
      He glanced up, looking angered and then almost immediately concerned. Langdon's eyes met his, and 
      Vittoria's too. The three of them were motionless a moment, as if all the tension between them had 
      been erased and replaced by a single, unifying foreboding. Kohler took his cell phone from the armrest. 
      He dialed an extension and fought off another coughing fit. 
      Vittoria and Langdon waited.  
      "This is... Director Kohler," he said, wheezing. "Yes? I was subterranean, out of range." He listened, 
      his gray eyes widening. "Who? Yes, patch it through." There was a pause. "Hello? This is Maximilian 
      Kohler. I am the director of CERN. With whom am I speaking?" 
      Vittoria and Langdon watched in silence as Kohler listened. 
      "It would be unwise," Kohler finally said, "to speak of this by phone. I will be there immediately." He 
      was coughing again. "Meet me... at Leonardo da Vinci Airport. Forty minutes." 
      Kohler's breath seemed to be failing him now. He descended into a fit of coughing and barely managed 
      to choke out the words, "Locate the canister immediately... I am coming." Then he clicked off his 
      phone. 
      Vittoria ran to Kohler's side, but Kohler could no longer speak. Langdon watched as Vittoria pulled 
      out her cell phone and paged CERN's infirmary. Langdon felt like a ship on the periphery of a storm... 
      tossed but detached. 
      Meet me at  Leonardo da Vinci Airport. Kohler's words echoed. The uncertain shadows that had 
      fogged Langdon's mind all morning, in a single instant, solidified into a vivid image. As he stood there 
      in the swirl of confusion, he felt a door inside him open... as if some mystic threshold had just been 
      breached. The ambigram. The murdered priest/scientist. The antimatter. And now... the target. 
      Leonardo da Vinci Airport could only mean one thing. In a moment of stark realization, Langdon 
      knew he had just crossed over. He had become a believer. Five kilotons. Let there be light. 
      Two paramedics materialized, racing across the atrium in white smocks. They knelt by Kohler, putting 
      an oxygen mask on his face. Scientists in the hall stopped and stood back. Kohler took two long pulls, 
      pushed the mask aside, and still gasping for air, looked up at Vittoria and Langdon. "Rome." 
      "Rome?" Vittoria demanded. "The antimatter is in Rome? Who called?" 
      Kohler's face was twisted, his gray eyes watering. "The Swiss..." He choked on the words, and the 
      paramedics put the mask back over his face. As they prepared to take him away, Kohler reached up 
      and grabbed Langdon's arm. 
      Langdon nodded. He knew. 
      "Go..." Kohler wheezed beneath his mask. "Go... call me..." Then the paramedics were rolling him 
      away. 
      Vittoria stood riveted to the floor, watching him go. Then she turned to Langdon. "Rome? But... what 
      was that about the Swiss?" 
      Langdon put a hand on her shoulder, barely whispering the words. "The Swiss Guard," he said. "The 
      sworn sentinels of Vatican City." 
                         59  
      "Mr. Langdon, I did not ask if you believe what man says about God. I asked if you believed in God. 
      There is a difference. Holy scripture is stories... legends and history of man's quest to understand his 
      own nee d for meaning. I am not asking you to pass judgment on literature. I am asking if you believe 
      in God. When you lie out under the stars, do you sense the divine? Do you feel in your gut that you are 
      staring up at the work of God's hand?" 
      Langdon took a long moment to consider it.  
      "I'm prying," Vittoria apologized. 
      "No, I just..." 
      "Certainly you must debate issues of faith with your classes." 
      "Endlessly."  
      "And you play devil's advocate, I imagine. Always fueling the debate." 
      Langdon smiled. "You must be a teacher too."  
      "No, but I learned from a master. My father could argue two sides of a M��bius Strip." 
      Langdon laughed, picturing the artful crafting of a M��bius Strip-a twisted ring of paper, which 
      technically possessed only one side. Langdon had first seen the single-sided shape in the artwork of  
      M. C. Escher.  
      "May I ask you a question, Ms. Vetra?" 
      "Call me Vittoria. Ms. Vetra makes me feel old." 
      He sighed inwardly, suddenly sensing his own age. "Vittoria, I'm Robert." 
      "You had a question."  
      "Yes. As a scientis t and the daughter of a Catholic priest, what do you think of religion?" 
      Vittoria paused, brushing a lock of hair from her eyes. "Religion is like language or dress. We gravitate 
      toward the practices with which we were raised. In the end, though, we are all proclaiming the same 
      thing. That life has meaning. That we are grateful for the power that created us."  
      Langdon was intrigued. "So you're saying that whether you are a Christian or a Muslim simply depends 
      on where you were born?" 
      "Isn't it obvious? Look at the diffusion of religion around the globe." 
      "So faith is random?"  
      "Hardly. Faith is universal. Our specific methods for understanding it are arbitrary. Some of us pray to 
      Jesus, some of us go to Mecca, some of us study subatomic particles. In the end we are all just 
      searching for truth, that which is greater than ourselves." 
      Langdon wished his students could express themselves so clearly. Hell, he wished he could express 
      himself so clearly.  
      "And God?" he asked. "Do you believe in God?" 
      Vittoria was silent for a long time. "Science tells me God must exist. My mind tells me I will never 
      understand God. And my heart tells me I am not meant to." 
      How's that for concise, he thought. "So you believe God is fact, but we will never understand Him." 
      "Her," she s aid with a smile. "Your Native Americans had it right." 
      Langdon chuckled. "Mother Earth." 
      "Gaea. The planet is an organism. All of us are cells with different purposes. And yet we are 
      intertwined. Serving each other. Serving the whole." 
      Looking at her, Langdon felt something stir within him that he had not felt in a long time. There was a 
      bewitching clarity in her eyes... a purity in her voice. He felt drawn. 
      "Mr. Langdon, let me ask you another question." 
      "Robert," he said. Mr. Langdon makes me feel old. I am old! 
      "If you don't mind my asking, Robert, how did you get involved with the Illuminati?" 
      Langdon thought back. "Actually, it was money." 
      Vittoria looked disappointed. "Money? Consulting, you mean?" 
      Langdon laughed, realizing how it must have sounded. "No. Money as in currency." 
      He reached in his pants pocket and pulled out some money. He found a one-dollar bill. "I became 
      fascinated with the cult when I first learned that U.S. currency is covered with Illuminati symbology." 
      Vittoria's eyes narrowed, ap parently not knowing whether or not to take him seriously. 
      Langdon handed her the bill. "Look at the back. See the Great Seal on the left?" 
                         61  
                           32  
       
       
      Langdon held his breath as the X-33 spiraled into Rome's Leonardo da Vinci International Airport. 
      Vittoria sat across from him, eyes closed as if trying to will the situation into control. The craft touched 
      down and taxied to a private hangar. 
      "Sorry for the slow flight," the pilot apologized, emerging from the cockpit. "Had to trim her back. 
      Noise regulations over populated areas." 
      Langdon checked his watch. They had been airborne thirty-seven minutes. 
      The pilot popped the outer door. "Anybody want to tell me what's going on?" 
      Neither Vittoria nor Langdon responded. 
      "Fine," he said, stretching. "I'll be in the cockpit with the air-conditioning and my music. Just me and 
      Garth." 
      The late-afternoon sun blazed outside the hangar. Langdon carried his tweed jacket over his shoulder. 
      Vittoria turned her face skyward and inhaled deeply, as if the sun's rays somehow transferred to her 
      some mystical replenishing energy. 
      Mediterraneans, Langdon mused, already sweating. 
      "Little old for cartoons, aren't you?" Vittoria asked, without opening her eyes. 
      "I'm sorry?"  
      "Your wristwatch. I saw it on the plane." 
      Langdon flushed slightly. He was accustomed to having to defend his timepiece. The collector's edition 
      Mickey Mouse watch had been a childhood gift from his parents. Despite the contorted foolishness of 
      Mickey's outstretched arms designating the hour, it was the only watch Langdon had ever worn. 
      Waterproof and glow -in-the-dark, it was perfect for swimming laps or walking unlit college paths at 
      night. When Langdon's students questioned his fashion sense, he told them he wore Mickey as a daily 
      reminder to stay young at heart.  
      "It's six o'clock," he said. 
      Vittoria nodded, eyes still closed. "I think our ride's here." 
      Langdon he ard the distant whine, looked up, and felt a sinking feeling. Approaching from the north 
      was a helicopter, slicing low across the runway. Langdon had been on a helicopter once in the Andean 
      Palpa Valley looking at the Nazca sand drawings and had not enjoyed it one bit. A flying shoebox. 
      After a morning of space plane rides, Langdon had hoped the Vatican would send a car. Apparently 
      not. 
      The chopper slowed overhead, hovered a moment, and dropped toward the runway in front of them. 
      The craft was white and carried a coat of arms emblazoned on the side-two skeleton keys crossing a 
      shield and papal crown. He knew the symbol well. It was the traditional seal of the Vatican-the sacred 
      symbol of the Holy See or "holy seat" of government, the seat being literally the ancient throne of St. 
      Peter. The Holy Chopper, Langdon groaned, watching the craft land. He'd forgotten the Vatican 
      owned one of these things, used for transporting the Pope to the airport, to meetings, or to his 
      summer palace in Gandolfo. Langdon definitely would have preferred a car. 
      The pilot jumped from the cockpit and strode toward them across the tarmac. Now it was Vittoria 
      who looked uneasy. "That's our pilot?" 
      Langdon shared her concern. "To fly, or not to fly. That is the question." 
      The pilot look ed like he was festooned for a Shakespearean melodrama. His puffy tunic was vertically 
      striped in brilliant blue and gold. He wore matching pantaloons and spats. On his feet were black flats 
      that looked like slippers. On top of it all, he wore a black felt beret. 
      "Traditional Swiss Guard uniforms," Langdon explained. "Designed by Michelangelo himself." As the 
      man drew closer, Langdon winced. "I admit, not one of Michelangelo's better efforts." 
      Despite the man's garish attire, Langdon could tell the pilot meant business. He moved toward them 
      with all the rigidity and dignity of a U.S. Marine. Langdon had read many times about the rigorous 
      requirements for becoming one of the elite Swiss Guard. Recruited from one of Switzerland's 
      four Catholic cantons, applicants had to be Swiss males between nineteen and thirty years old, at least 
                         63  
                           33  
       
      Rome from the air is a  labyrinth-an indecipherable maze of ancient roadways winding around 
      buildings, fountains, and crumbling ruins. The Vatican chopper stayed low in the sky as it sliced 
      northwest through the permanent smog layer coughed up by the congestion below. Langdon gazed 
      down at the mopeds, sight-seeing buses, and armies of miniature Fiat sedans buzzing around rotaries in 
      all directions. 
      Koyaanisqatsi, he thought, recalling the Hopi term for "life out of balance." 
      Vittoria sat in silent determination in the seat beside him. 
      The chopper banked hard. 
      His stomach dropping, Langdon gazed farther into the distance. His eyes found the crumbling ruins of 
      the Roman Coliseum. The Coliseum, Langdon had always thought, was one of history's greatest 
      ironies. Now a dignified symbol for the rise of human culture and civilization, the stadium had been 
      built to host centuries of barbaric events-hungry lions shredding prisoners, armies of slaves battling to 
      the death, gang rapes of exotic women captured from far-off lands, as well as public beheadings and 
      castrations. It was ironic, Langdon thought, or perhaps fitting, that the Coliseum had served as the 
      architectural blueprint for Harvard's Soldier Field-the football stadium where the ancient traditions of 
      savagery were reenacted every fall... crazed fans screaming for bloodshed as Harvard battled Yale. 
      As the chopper headed north, Langdon spied the Roman Forum-the heart of pre-Christian Rome. The  
      decaying columns looked like toppled gravestones in a cemetery that had somehow avoided being 
      swallowed by the metropolis surrounding it. 
      To the west the wide basin of the Tiber River wound enormous arcs across the city. Even from the air 
      Langdon could tell the water was deep. The churning currents were brown, filled with silt and foam 
      from heavy  rains. 
      "Straight ahead," the pilot said, climbing higher. 
      Langdon and Vittoria looked out and saw it. Like a mountain parting the morning fog, the colossal 
      dome rose out of the haze before them: St. Peter's Basilica. 
      "Now that," Langdon said to Vittoria, "is something Michelangelo got right." 
      Langdon had never seen St. Peter's from the air. The marble fa��ade blazed like fire in the afternoon 
      sun. Adorned with 140 statues of saints, martyrs, and angels, the Herculean edifice stretched two 
      football fields wide and a staggering six long. The cavernous interior of the basilica had room for over 
      60,000 worshipers... over one hundred times the population of Vatican City, the smallest country in the 
      world. 
      Incredibly, though, not even a citadel of this magnitude could dwarf the piazza before it. A sprawling 
      expanse of granite, St. Peter's Square was a staggering open space in the congestion of Rome, like a 
      classical Central Park. In front of the basilica, bordering the vast oval common, 284 columns swept 
      outward in four concentric arcs of diminishing size... an architectural trompe de l'oiel used to heighten 
      the piazza's sense of grandeur. As he stared at the magnificent shrine before him, Langdon wondered 
      what St. Peter would think if he were here now. The Saint had died a gruesome death, crucified upside 
      down on this very spot. Now he rested in the most sacred of tombs, buried five stories down, directly 
      beneath the central cupola of the basilica. 
      "Vatican City," the pilot said, sounding anything but welcoming. 
      Langdon looked out at the towering stone bastions that loomed ahead-impenetrable fortifications 
      surrounding the complex... a strangely earthly defense for a spiritual world of secrets, power, and 
      mystery.   
      "Look!" Vittoria said suddenly, grabbing Langdon's arm. She motioned frantically downward toward 
      St. Peter's Square directly beneath them. Langdon put his face to the window and looked. 
      "Over there," she said, pointing. 
      Langdon looked. The rear of the piazza looked like a parking lot crowded with a dozen or so trailer 
      trucks. Huge satellite dishes pointed skyward from the roof of every truck. The dishes were 
      emblazoned with familiar names: 
      TELEVISOR EUROPEA 
      VIDEO ITALIA 
                         65  
                           34 
        
       
      Cardinal Mortati gazed up at the lavish ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and tried to find a moment of quiet 
      reflection. The frescoed walls echoed with the voices of cardinals from nations around the globe. The 
      men jostled in the candlelit tabernacle, whispering excitedly and consulting with one another in 
      numerous languages, the universal tongues being English, Italian, and Spanish. 
      The light in the chapel was usually sublime-long rays of tinted su n slicing through the darkness like rays 
      from heaven -but not today. As was the custom, all of the chapel's windows had been covered in black 
      velvet in the name of secrecy. This ensured that no one on the inside could send signals or 
      communicate in any way with the outside world. The result was a profound darkness lit only by 
      candles... a shimmering radiance that seemed to purify everyone it touched, making them all ghostly... 
      like saints.  
      What privilege, Mortati thought, that I am to oversee this sanctified event. Cardinals over eighty years 
      of age were too old to be eligible for election and did not attend conclave, but at seventy-nine years 
      old, Mortati was the most senior cardinal here and had been appointed to oversee the proceedings. 
      Following tradition, the cardinals gathered here two hours before conclave to catch up with friends and 
      engage in last -minute discussion. At 7 P.M., the late Pope's chamberlain would arrive, give opening 
      prayer, and then leave. Then the Swiss Guard would seal the doors and lock all the cardinals inside. It 
      was then that the oldest and most secretive political ritual in the world would begin. The cardinals 
      would not be released until they decided who among them would be the next Pope. 
      Conclave. Even the name was secretive. "Con clave" literally meant "locked with a key." The cardinals 
      were permitted no contact whatsoever with the outside world. No phone calls. No messages. No 
      whispers through doorways. Conclave was a vacuum, not to be influenced by anything in the outside 
      world. This would ensure that the cardinals kept Solum Dum prae oculis... only God before their eyes. 
      Outside the walls of the chapel, of course, the media watched and waited, speculating as to which of 
      the cardinals would become the ruler of one billion Catholics worldwide. Conclaves created an intense, 
      politically charged atmosphere, and over the centuries they had turned deadly; poisonings, fist fights, 
      and even murder had erupted within the sacred walls. Ancient history, Mortati thought. Tonight's 
      conclave w ill be unified, blissful, and above all... brief. Or at least that had been his speculation. 
      Now, however, an unexpected development had emerged. Mystifyingly, four cardinals were absent 
      from the chapel. Mortati knew that all the exits to Vatican City were guarded, and the missing cardinals 
      could not have gone far, but still, with less than an hour before opening prayer, he was feeling 
      disconcerted. After all, the four missing men were no ordinary cardinals. They were the cardinals. 
      The chosen four.  
      As over seer of the conclave, Mortati had already sent word through the proper channels to the Swiss 
      Guard alerting them to the cardinals' absence. He had yet to hear back. Other cardinals had now 
      noticed the puzzling absence. The anxious whispers had begun. Of all cardinals, these four should be 
      on time! Cardinal Mortati was starting to fear it might be a long evening after all. He had no idea. 
                         67  
      sharp scythe -rumored to have decapitated countless Muslims while defending the Christian crusaders 
      in the fifteenth century. As Langdon and Vittoria approached, the two guards stepped forward, 
      crossing their long swords, blocking the entrance. One looked up at the pilot in confusion.  
      "I antaloni," he said, motioning to Vittoria's shorts. 
      The pilot waved them off. "Il comandante vuole vederli subito." 
      The guards frowned. Reluctantly they stepped aside. 
      Inside, the air was cool. It looked nothing like the administrative security offices Langdon would have 
      imagined. Ornate and impeccably furnished, the hallways contained paintings Langdon was certain any 
      museum worldwide would gladly have featured in its main gallery. The pilot pointed down a steep set 
      of stai rs. "Down, please." 
      Langdon and Vittoria followed the white marble treads as they descended between a gauntlet of nude 
      male sculptures. Each statue wore a fig leaf that was lighter in color than the rest of the body. 
      The Great Castration, Langdon thought. It was one of the most horrific tragedies in Renaissance art. In 
      1857, Pope Pius IX decided that the accurate representation of the male form might incite lust inside 
      the Vatican. So he got a chisel and mallet and hacked off the genitalia of every single male statue inside 
      Vatican City. He defaced works by Michelangelo, Bramante, and Bernini. Plaster fig leaves were used 
      to patch the damage. Hundreds of sculptures had been emasculated. Langdon had often wondered if 
      there was a huge crate of stone penises someplace.  
      "Here," the guard announced. 
      They reached the bottom of the stairs and dead-ended at a heavy, steel door. The guard typed an entry 
      code, and the door slid open. Langdon and Vittoria entered. 
                   Beyond the threshold was absolute mayhem. 
                         69  
      flashed superimposed text: LIVE FEED-CAMERA #86. Vittoria looked at the time remaining on the 
      flashing indicator on the canister.  
      "Under six hours," she whispered to Langdon, her face tense. 
      Langdon checked his watch. "So we have until..." He stopped, a knot tightening in his stomach. 
      "Midnight," Vittoria said, with a withering look. Midnight, Langdon thought. A flair for the dramatic. 
      Apparently whoever stole the canister last night had timed it perfectly. A stark foreboding set in as he 
      realized he was currently sitting at ground zero. 
      Olivetti's whisper now sounded more like a hiss. "Does this object belong to your facility?"  
      Vittoria nodded. "Yes, sir. It was stolen from us. It contains an extremely combustible substance called 
      antimatter." 
      Olivetti looked unmoved. "I am quite familiar with incendiaries, Ms. Vetra. I have not heard of 
      antimatter." 
      "It's new technology. We need to locate it immediately or evacuate Vatican City." 
      Olivetti closed his eyes slowly and reopened them, as if refocusing on Vittoria might change what he 
      just heard. "Evacuate? Are you aware what is going on here this evening?" 
      "Yes, sir. And the lives of your cardinals are in danger. We have about six hours. Have you made any 
      headway locating the canister?" 
      Olivetti shook his head. "We haven't started looking." 
      Vittoria choked. "What? But we expressly heard your guards talking about searching the -" 
      "Searching, yes," Olivetti said, "but not for your canister. My men are looking for something else that 
      does not concern you." 
      Vittoria's voice cracked. "You haven't even begun looking for this canister?" 
      Olivetti's pupils seemed to recede into his head. He had the passionless look of an insect. "Ms. Vetra, is 
      it? Let me explain something to you. The director of your facility refused to share any details about this 
      object with me over the phone except to say that I needed to find it immediately. We are exceptionally 
      busy, and I do not have the luxury of dedicating manpower to a situation until I get some facts." 
      "There is only one relevant fact at this moment, sir," Vittoria said, "that being that in six hours that 
      device is going to  vaporize this entire complex." 
      Olivetti stood motionless. "Ms. Vetra, there is something you need to know." His tone hinted at 
      patronizing. "Despite the archaic appearance of Vatican City, every single entrance, both public and 
      private, is equipped with th e most advanced sensing equipment known to man. If someone tried to 
      enter with any sort of incendiary device it would be detected instantly. We have radioactive isotope 
      scanners, olfactory filters designed by the American DEA to detect the faintest chemical signatures of 
      combustibles and toxins. We also use the most advanced metal detectors and X-ray scanners available." 
      "Very impressive," Vittoria said, matching Olivetti's cool. "Unfortunately, antimatter is nonradioactive, 
      its chemical signature is that o f pure hydrogen, and the canister is plastic. None of those devices would 
      have detected it." 
      "But the device has an energy source," Olivetti said, motioning to the blinking LED. "Even the 
      smallest trace of nickel-cadmium would register as -" 
      "The batteries  are also plastic."  
      Olivetti's patience was clearly starting to wane. "Plastic batteries?" 
      "Polymer gel electrolyte with Teflon." 
      Olivetti leaned toward her, as if to accentuate his height advantage. 
      "Signorina, the Vatican is the target of dozens of bomb threats a month. I personally train every Swiss 
      Guard in modern explosive technology. I am well aware that there is no substance on earth powerful 
      enough to do what you are describing unless you are talking about a nuclear warhead with a fuel core 
      the size of a baseball."  
      Vittoria framed him with a fervent stare. "Nature has many mysteries yet to unveil." 
      Olivetti leaned closer. "Might I ask exactly who you are? What is your position at CERN?" 
      "I am a senior member of the research staff and appointed liaison to the Vatican for this crisis."  
      "Excuse me for being rude, but if this is indeed a crisis, why am I dealing with you and not your 
      director? And what disrespect do you intend by coming into Vatican City in short pants?" 
                         71  
      "Take me to the person in charge," Vittoria demanded. 
      Olivetti glared. "You've got him." 
      "No," she said. "Someone in the clergy." 
      The veins on Olivetti's brow began to show. "The clergy has gone. With the exception of the Swiss 
      Guard, the only ones present in Vatican City at this time are the College of Cardinals. And they are 
      inside the Sistine Chapel."  
      "How about the chamberlain?" Langdon stated flatly. 
      "Who?" 
      "The late Pope's chamberlain." Langdon repeated the word self-assuredly, praying his memory served 
      him. He recalled reading once about the curious arrangement of Vatican authority following the death 
      of a Pope. If Langdon was correct, during the interim between Popes, complete autonomous power 
      shifted temporarily to the late Pope's personal assistant-his chamberlain-a secretarial underling who 
      oversaw c onclave until the cardinals chose the new Holy Father. "I believe the chamberlain is the man 
      in charge at the moment." 
      "Il camerlegno?" Olivetti scowled. "The camerlegno is only a priest here. He is not even canonized. He 
      is the late Pope's hand servant." 
      "But he is here. And you answer to him." 
      Olivetti crossed his arms. "Mr. Langdon, it is true that Vatican rule dictates the camerlegno assume 
      chief executive office during conclave, but it is only because his lack of eligibility for the papacy 
      ensures an u nbiased election. It is as if your president died, and one of his aides temporarily sat in the 
      oval office. The camerlegno is young, and his understanding of security, or anything else for that 
      matter, is extremely limited. For all intents and purposes, I am in charge here." 
      "Take us to him," Vittoria said.  
      "Impossible. Conclave begins in forty minutes. The camerlegno is in the Office of the Pope preparing. 
      I have no intention of disturbing him with matters of security." 
      Vittoria opened her mouth to respond but was interrupted by a knocking at the door. Olivetti opened 
      it. A guard in full regalia stood outside, pointing to his watch. "���� l'ora, comandante." 
      Olivetti checked his own watch and nodded. He turned back to Langdon and Vittoria like a judge 
      pondering their fate. "Follow me." He led them out of the monitoring room across the security center 
      to a small clear cubicle against the rear wall. "My office." Olivetti ushered them inside. The room was 
      unspecial -a cluttered desk, file cabinets, folding chairs, a water cooler. "I will be back in ten minutes. I 
      suggest you use the time to decide how you would like to proceed." 
      Vittoria wheeled. "You can't just leave! That canister is-" 
      "I do not have time for this," Olivetti seethed. "Perhaps I should detain you until after the conclave 
      when I do have time." 
      "Signore," the guard urged, pointing to his watch again. "Spazzare di capella." 
      Olivetti nodded and started to leave. 
      "Spazzare di capella?" Vittoria demanded. "You're leaving to sweep the chapel?" 
      Olivetti turned, his eyes boring through her. "We sweep for electronic bugs, Miss Vetra-a matter of  
      discretion." He motioned to her legs. "Not something I would expect you to understand." 
      With that he slammed the door, rattling the heavy glass. In one fluid motion he produced a key, 
      inserted it, and twisted. A heavy deadbolt slid into place. 
      "Idi��ta!" Vittoria yelled. "You can't keep us in here!" 
      Through the glass, Langdon could see Olivetti say something to the guard. The sentinel nodded. As 
      Olivetti strode out of the room, the guard spun and faced them on the other side of the glass, arms 
      crossed, a large sidearm visible on his hip. 
      Perfect, Langdon thought. Just bloody perfect. 
                         73  
      Langdon did not have time to respond. The guard outside the door started rapping on the glass with 
      the butt of his gun. He motioned for her to set down the phone. Vittoria winked at him. The guard 
      seemed to inflate with rage. 
      Langdon moved away from the door and turned back to Vittoria. "You damn well better be right, 
      'cause this guy does not look amused!" 
      "Damn!" she said, listening to the receiver. "A recording." 
      "Recording?" Langdon demanded. "The Pope has an answering machine?" 
      "It wasn't the Pope's office," Vittoria said, hanging up. "It was the damn weekly menu for the Vatican 
      commissary."  
      Langdon offered a weak smile to the guard outside who was now glaring angrily though the glass while 
      he hailed Olivetti on his walkie-talkie. 
                         75  
      Olivetti ripped the receiver from her hand, and raised it to his ear. "Who the hell is this!" 
      For the tiniest of an instant, Olivetti's inelastic posture slumped. "Yes, camerlegno..." he said. "Correct, 
      signore... but questions of security demand... of course not... I am holding her here for... certainly, 
      but..." He listened. "Yes, sir," he said finally. "I will bring them up immediately." 
                         77  
      Olivetti stood rigid, his back arched like a soldier under intense inspection. Langdon felt hypnotized by 
      the camerlegno's presence. Young and wearied as he was, the priest had the air of some mythical hero-
      radiating charisma and authority. 
      "Signore," Olivetti said, his tone apologetic but still unyielding. "You should not concern yourself with 
      matters of security. You have other responsibilities." 
      "I am well aware of my other responsibilities. I am also aware that as direttore intermediario, I have a 
      responsibility for the safety and well-being of everyone at this conclave. What is going on here?" 
      "I have the situation under control." 
      "Apparently not."  
      "Father," Langdon interrupted, taking out the crumpled fax and handing it to the camerlegno, "please." 
      Commander Olivetti stepped forward, trying to intervene. "Father, please do not trouble your thoughts 
      with-" 
      The camerlegno took the fax, ignoring Olivetti for a long moment. He looked at the image of the 
      murdered Leonardo Vetra and drew a startled breath. "What is this?" 
      "That is my father," Vittoria said, her voice wavering. "He was a priest and a man of science. He was 
      murdered last night." 
      The camerlegno's face softened instantly. He looked up at her. "My dear child. I'm so sorry." He 
      crossed himself and looked again at the fax, his eyes seeming to pool with waves of abhorrence. "Who 
      would... and this burn on his..." The camerlegno paused, squinting closer at the image. 
      "It says Illuminati," Langdon said. "No doubt you are familiar with the name." 
      An odd look came across the camerlegno's face. "I have heard the name, yes, but..." 
      "The Illuminati murdered Leonardo Vetra so they could steal a new technology he was-" 
      "Signore," Olivetti interjected. "This is absurd. The Illuminati? This is clearly some sort of elaborate 
      hoax." 
      The camerlegno seemed to ponder Olivetti's words. Then he turned and contemplated Langdon so 
      fully that Langdon felt the air leave his lungs.  
      "Mr. Langdon, I have spent my life in the Catholic Church. I am familiar with the Illuminati lore... and 
      the legend of the brandings. And yet I must warn you, I am a man of the present tense. Christianity has 
      enough real enemies without resurrecting ghosts." 
      "The symbol is authentic," Langdon said, a little too defensively he thought. He reached over and 
      rotated the fax for the camerlegno. The camerlegno fell silent when he saw the symmetry. 
      "Even modern computers," Langdon added, "have been unable to forge a symmetrical ambigram of 
      this word." 
      The camerlegno folded his hands and said nothing for a long time. "The Illuminati are dead," he finally 
      said. "Long ago. That is historical fact." 
      Langdon nodded. "Yesterday, I would have agreed with you." 
      "Yesterday?"  
      "Before today's chain of events. I believe the Illuminati have resurfaced to make good on an ancient 
      pact." 
      "Forgive me. My history is rusty. What ancient pact is this?" 
      Langdon took a deep breath. "The destruction of Vatican City." 
      "Destroy Vatican City?" The camerlegno looked less frightened than confused. 
      "But that would be impossible." 
      Vittoria shook her head. "I'm afraid we have some more bad news." 
                         79  
      "Comandante?"  
      Olivetti snatched it up and pressed the transmitter. "Sto ocupato! Cosa voi!!" 
      "Scusi," the Swiss Guard on the radio said. "Communications here. I thought you would want to be 
      informed that we have received a bomb threat." 
      Olivetti could not have looked less interested. "So handle it! Run the usual trace, and write it up."  
      "We did, sir, but the caller..." The guard paused. "I would not trouble you, commander, except that he 
      mentioned the substance you just asked me to research. Antimatter."  
      Everyone in the room exchanged stunned looks. 
      "He mentioned what?" Olivetti stammered. 
      "Antimatter, sir. While we were trying to run a trace, I did some additional research on his claim. The 
      information on antimatter is... well, frankly, it's quite troubling." 
      "I thought you said the ballistics guide showed no mention of it." 
      "I found it on -line." 
      Alleluia, Vittoria thought. 
      "The substance appears to be quite explosive," the guard said. "It's hard to imagine this information is 
      accurate but it says here that pound for pound antimatter carries about a hundred times more payload 
      than a nuclear warhead." 
      Olivetti slumped. It was like watching a mountain crumble. Vittoria's feeling of triumph was erased by 
      the look of horror on the camerlegno's face. 
      "Did you trace the call?" Olivetti stammered. 
      "No luck. C ellular with heavy encryption. The SAT lines are interfused, so triangulation is out. The IF 
      signature suggests he's somewhere in Rome, but there's really no way to trace him." 
      "Did he make demands?" Olivetti said, his voice quiet. 
      "No, sir. Just warned us that there is antimatter hidden inside the complex. He seemed surprised I 
      didn't know. Asked me if I'd seen it yet. You'd asked me about antimatter, so I decided to advise you." 
      "You did the right thing," Olivetti said. "I'll be down in a minute. Alert me immediately if he calls 
      back."  
      There was a moment of silence on the walkie-talkie. "The caller is still on the line, sir."  
      Olivetti looked like he'd just been electrocuted. "The line is open?" 
      "Yes, sir. We've been trying to trace him for ten minutes, getting nothing but splayed ferreting. He 
      must know we can't touch him because he refuses to hang up until he speaks to the camerlegno." 
      "Patch him through," the camerlegno commanded. "Now!" 
      Olivetti wheeled. "Father, no. A trained Swiss Guard negotiator is much better suited to handle this." 
      "Now!" 
      Olivetti gave the order. 
      A moment later, the phone on Camerlegno Ventresca's desk began to ring. The camerlegno rammed 
      his finger down on the speaker-phone button. "Who in the name of God do you think you are?" 
                         81  
      "Enjoying the grounds?"  The calm departed from the camerlegno's voice. "They were due in the chapel 
      over an hour ago!"  
      Langdon shot Vittoria a look of amazement. Missing cardinals? So that's what they were looking for 
      downstairs?   
      "Our inventory," the caller said, "you will find quite convincing. There is Cardinal Lamass�� from Paris, 
      Cardinal Guidera from Barcelona, Cardinal Ebner from Frankfurt..."  
      Olivetti seemed to shrink smaller and smaller after each name was read. The caller paused, as though 
      taking special pleasure in the final name.   
      "And from Italy... Cardinal Baggia." 
      The camerlegno loosened like a tall ship that had just run sheets first into a dead calm. His frock 
      billowed, and he collapsed in his chair.  
      "I preferiti," he whispered. "The four favorites . . . including Baggia... the  
      most likely successor as Supreme Pontiff... how is it possible?" 
      Langdon had read enough about modern papal elections to understand the look of desperation on the 
      camerlegno's face. Although technically any cardinal under eighty years old could become Pope, only a 
      very few had the respect necessary to command a two-thirds majority in the ferociously partisan 
      balloting procedure. They were known as the preferiti. And they were all gone. 
      Sweat dripped from the camerlegno's brow. "What do you intend with these men?" 
      "What do you think I intend? I am a descendant of the Hassassin." 
      Langdon felt a shiver. He knew the name well. The church had made some deadly enemies through the 
      years-the Hassassin, the Knights Templar, armies that had been either hunted by the Vatican or 
      betrayed by them. 
      "Let the cardinals go," the camerlegno said. "Isn't threatening to destroy the City of God enough?" 
      "Forget your four cardinals. They are lost to you. Be assured their deaths will be remembered though... 
      by millions. Every martyr's dream. I will make them media luminaries. One by one. By midnight the 
      Illuminati will have everyone's attention. Why change the world if the world is not watching? Public 
      killings have an intoxicating horror about them, don't they? You proved that long ago... the inquisition, 
      the torture of the Knights Templar, the Crusades." He paused. "And of course, la purga." 
      The camerlegno was silent.  
      "Do you not recall la purga?" the caller asked. "Of course not, you are a child. Priests are poor 
      historians, anyway. Perhaps because their history shames them?" 
      "La purga," Langdon heard himself say. "Sixteen sixty-eight. The church branded four Illuminati 
      scientists with the symbol of the cross. To purge their sins." 
      "Who is speaking?" the voice demanded, sounding more intrigued than concerned. 
      "Who else is there?"  
      Langdon felt shaky. "My name is not important," he said, trying to keep his voice from wavering. 
      Speaking to a living Illuminatus was disorienting for him... like speaking to George Washington. "I am 
      an academic who has studied the history of your brotherhood." 
      "Superb," the voice replied. "I am pleased there are still those alive who remember the crimes against 
      us." 
      "Most of us think you are dead." 
      "A misconception the brotherhood has worked hard to promote. What else do you know of la purga?" 
      Langdon hesitated. What else do I know? That this whole situation is insanity, that's what I know! 
      "After the brandings, the scientists were murdered, and their bodies were dropped in public locations 
      around Rome as a warning to other scientists not to join the Illuminati." 
      "Yes. So we shall do the same. Quid pro quo. Consider it symbolic retribution for our slain brothers. 
      Your four cardinals will die, one every hour starting at eight. By midnight the whole world will be 
      enthralled." 
      Langdon moved toward the phone. "You actually intend to brand and kill these four men?" 
      "History repeats itself, does it not? Of course, we will be more elegant and bold than the church was. 
      They killed privately, dropping bodies when no one was looking. It seems so cowardly." 
      "What are you saying?" Langdon asked. "That you are going to brand and kill these men in public?" 
      "Very good. Although it depends what you consider public. I realize not many people go to church 
                         83  
      Langdon flashed on the alleged Illuminati fortunes, the ancient wealth of the Bavarian stone masons, 
      the Rothschilds, the Bilderbergers, the legendary Illuminati Diamond. 
      "I preferiti," the camerlegno said, changing the subject. His voice was pleading. "Spare them. They are 
      old. They -" 
      "They are virgin sacrifices." The caller laughed. "Tell me, do you think they are really virgins? Will the 
      little lambs squeal when they die? Sacrifici vergini nell' altare di scienza." 
      The camerlegno was silent for a long time. "They are men of faith," he finally said. "They do not fear 
      death." 
      The caller sneered. "Leonardo Vetra was a man of faith, and yet I saw fear in his eyes last night. A fear 
      I removed."  
      Vittoria, who had been silent, was suddenly airborne, her body taut with hatred.  
      "Asino! He was my father!" 
      A cackle echoed from the speaker. "Your father? What is this? Vetra has a daughter? You should know 
      your father whimpered like a child at the end. Pitiful really. A pathetic man." 
      Vittoria reeled as if knocked backward by the words. Langdon reached for her, but she regained her 
      balance and fixed her dark eyes on the phone. "I swear on my life, before this night is over, I will find 
      you." Her voice sharpened like a laser. "And when I do..." 
      The caller laughed coarsely. "A woman of spirit. I am aroused. Perhaps before this night is over, I will 
      find you. And when I do..."  
      The words hung like a blade. Then he was gone.  
                         85  
      Mortati turned. 
      One of the cardinals was tapping him nervously on the shoulder. "You know where they are, don't 
      you?" 
      Mortati tried not to show too much concern. "Perhaps still with the camerlegno." 
      "At this hour? That would be highly unorthodox!" The cardinal frowned mistrustingly. "Perhaps the 
      camerlegno lost track of time?" 
      Mortati sincerely doubted it, but he said nothing. He was well aware that most cardinals did not much 
      care for the camerlegno, feeling he was too young to serve the Pope so closely. 
      Mortati suspected much of the cardinals' dislike was jealousy, and Mortati actually admired the young 
      man, secretly applauding the late Pope's selection for chamberlain. Mortati saw only conviction when 
      he looked in the camerlegno's eyes, and unlike many of the cardinals, the camerlegno put church and 
      faith before petty politics. He was truly a man of God. 
      Throughout his tenure, the camerlegno's steadfast devotion had become legendary. Many attributed it 
      to the miraculous event in his childhood... an event that would have left a permanent impression on 
      any man's heart. The miracle and wonder of it, Mortati thought, often wishing his own childhood had 
      presented an event that fostered that kind of doubtless faith. 
      Unfortunately for the church, Mortati knew, the camerlegno would never become Pope in his elder 
      years. Attaining the papacy required a certain amount of political ambition, something the young 
      camerlegno apparently lacked; he had refused his Pope's offers for higher clerical stations many times, 
      saying he preferred to serve the church as a simple man. 
      "What next?" The cardinal tapped Mortati, waiting. 
      Mortati looked up. "I'm sorry?" 
      "They're late! What shall we do!" 
      "What can we do?" Mortati replied. "We wait. And have faith." 
      Looking entirely unsatisfied with Mortati's response, the cardinal shrunk back into the shadows. 
      Mortati stood a moment, dabbing his temples and trying to clear his mind.  
      Indeed, what shall we do? He gazed past the altar up to Michelangelo's renowned fresco, "The Last 
      Judgment." 
      The painting did nothing to soothe his anxiety. It was a horrifying, fifty-foot-tall depiction of Jesus 
      Christ separating mankind into the righteous and sinners, casting the sinners into hell. There was flayed 
      flesh, burning bodies, and even one of Michelangelo's rivals sitting in hell wearing ass's ears. Guy de 
      Maupassant had once written that the painting looked like something painted for a carnival wrestling 
      booth by an ignorant coal heaver. 
      Cardinal Mortati had to agree.  
                         87  
      "Real world, signore. You're in it tonight. Listen closely." Olivetti spoke now with the efficient rattle of 
      a field officer. "Marching one hundred sixty-five cardinals unprepared and unprotected into Rome 
      would be reckless. It would cause confusion and panic in some very old men, and frankly, 
      one fatal stroke this month is enough." 
      One fatal stroke. The commander's words recalled the headlines Langdon had read over dinner with 
      some students in the Harvard Commons: POPE SUFFERS STROKE. DIES IN SLEEP. 
      "In addition," Olivetti said, "the Sistine Chapel is a fortress. Although we don't advertise the fact, the 
      structure is heavily reinforced and can repel any attack short of missiles. As preparation we searched 
      every inch of the chapel this afternoon, scanning for bugs and other surveillance equipment. The 
      chapel is clean, a safe haven, and I am confident the antimatter is not inside. There is no safer place 
      those men can be right now. We can always discuss emergency evacuation later if it comes to that." 
      Langdon was impressed. Olivetti's cold, smart logic reminded him of Kohler. 
      "Commander," Vittoria said, her voice tense, "there are other concerns. Nobody has ever created this 
      much antimatter. The blast radius, I can only estimate. Some of surrounding Rome may be in danger. 
      If the canister is in one of your central buildings or underground, the effect outside these walls may be 
      minimal, but if the canister is near the perimeter... in this building for example..." She glanced warily 
      out the window at the crowd in St. Peter's Square. 
      "I am well awa re of my responsibilities to the outside world," Olivetti replied, "and it makes this 
      situation no more grave. The protection of this sanctuary has been my sole charge for over two 
      decades. I have no intention of allowing this weapon to detonate." 
      Camerlegno Ventresca looked up. "You think you can find it?" 
      "Let me discuss our options with some of my surveillance specialists. There is a possibility, if we kill 
      power to Vatican City, that we can eliminate the background RF and create a clean enough 
      environme nt to get a reading on that canister's magnetic field." 
      Vittoria looked surprised, and then impressed. "You want to black out Vatican City?" 
      "Possibly. I don't yet know if it's possible, but it is one option I want to explore." 
      "The cardinals would certainly wonder what happened," Vittoria remarked. Olivetti shook his head. 
      "Conclaves are held by candlelight. The cardinals would never know. After conclave is sealed, I could 
      pull all except a few of my perimeter guards and begin a search. A hundred men could cover a lot of 
      ground in five hours."  
      "Four hours," Vittoria corrected. "I need to fly the canister back to CERN. Detonation is unavoidable 
      without recharging the batteries." 
      "There's no way to recharge here?" 
      Vittoria shook her head. "The interface is complex. I'd have brought it if I could." 
      "Four hours then," Olivetti said, frowning. "Still time enough. Panic serves no one. Signore, you have 
      ten minutes. Go to the chapel, seal conclave. Give my men some time to do their job. As we get closer 
      to the critical hour, we will make the critical decisions." 
      Langdon wondered how close to "the critical hour" Olivetti would let things get.  
      The camerlegno looked troubled. "But the college will ask about the preferiti... especially about 
      Baggia... where they are." 
      "Then you will have to think of something, signore. Tell them you served the four cardinals something 
      at tea that disagreed with them." 
      The camerlegno looked riled. "Stand on the altar of the Sistine Chapel and lie to the College of 
      Cardinals?" 
      "For their own safety. Una bugia veniale. A white lie. Your job will be to keep the peace." Olivetti 
      headed for the door. "Now if you will excuse me, I need to get started." 
      "Comandante," the camerlegno urged, "we cannot simply turn our backs on missing cardinals." 
      Olivetti stopped in the doorway. "Baggia and the others are currently outside our sphere of influence. 
      We must let them go... for the good of the whole. The military calls it triage." 
      "Don't you mean abandonment?" 
      His voice hardened. "If there were any way, signore... any way in heaven to locate those four cardinals, 
      I would lay down my life to do it. And yet..." He pointed across the room at the window where the 
      early evening sun glinted off an endless sea of Roman rooftops. "Searching a city of five million is not 
                                      89

       The central office of the British Broadcast Corporation (BBC) is in London just west of Piccadilly 
       Circus. The switchboard phone rang, and a junior content editor picked up.  
       "BBC," she said, stubbing out her Dunhill cigarette. The voice on the line was raspy, with a Mid-East 
       accent. "I have a breaking story your network might be interested in." 
       The editor took o ut a pen and a standard Lead Sheet. "Regarding?" 
       "The papal election." 
       She frowned wearily. The BBC had run a preliminary story yesterday to mediocre response. The public, 
       it seemed, had little interest in Vatican City. "What's the angle?" 
       "Do you have a TV reporter in Rome covering the election?" 
       "I believe so." 
       "I need to speak to him directly." 
       "I'm sorry, but I cannot give you that number without some idea-" 
       "There is a threat to the conclave. That is all I can tell you." 
       The editor took notes. "Your name?" 
       "My name is immaterial." 
       The editor was not surprised. "And you have proof of this claim?" 
       "I do." 
       "I would be happy to take the information, but it is not our policy to give out our reporters' numbers 
       unless-" 
       "I understand. I will call another network. Thank you for your time. Good-b-" 
       "Just a moment," she said. "Can you hold?" 
       The editor put the caller on hold and stretched her neck. The art of screening out potential crank calls 
       was by no means a perfect science, but this caller had just passed the BBC's two tacit tests for 
       authenticity of a phone source. He had refused to give his name, and he was eager to get off the 
       phone. Hacks and glory hounds usually whined and pleaded. Fortunately for her, reporters lived in 
       eternal fear of missing the big story, so they seldom chastised her for passing along the occasional 
       delusional psychotic. Wasting five minutes of a reporter's time was forgivable. Missing a headline was 
       not. 
       Yawning, she looked at her computer and typed in the keywords "Vatican City." 
       When she saw the name of the field reporter covering the papal election, she chuckled to herself. He 
       was a new guy the BBC had just brought up from some trashy London tabloid to handle some of the 
       BBC's more mundane coverage. Editorial had obviously started him at the bottom rung. He was 
       probably bored out of his mind, waiting all night to record his live ten-second video spot. He would 
       most likely be grateful for a break in the monotony. The BBC content editor copied down the 
       reporter's satellite extension in Vatican City. Then, lighting another cigarette, she gave the anonymous 
       caller the reporter's number. 
                         91  
      airbags... those are  things that protect you. God does not protect you. Intelligence protects you. 
      Enlightenment. Put your faith in something with tangible results. How long has it been since someone 
      walked on water? Modern miracles belong to science... computers, vaccines, space stations... even the 
      divine miracle of creation. Matter from nothing... in a lab. Who needs God? No! Science is God. 
      The killer's voice resonated in Langdon's mind. Midnight... mathematical progression of death... 
      sacrifici vergini nell' altare di scienza." Then suddenly, like a crowd dispersed by a single gunshot, the 
      voices were gone.  
      Robert Langdon bolted to his feet. His chair fell backward and crashed on the marble floor. Vittoria 
      and the camerlegno jumped.  
      "I missed it," Langdon whispered, spellbound. "It was right in front of me..." 
      "Missed what?" Vittoria demanded. 
      Langdon turned to the priest. "Father, for three years I have petitioned this office for access to the 
      Vatican Archives. I have been denied seven times." 
      "Mr. Langdon, I am sorry, but this hardly seems the moment to raise such complaints." 
      "I need access immediately. The four missing cardinals. I may be able to figure out where they're going 
      to be killed." 
      Vittoria stared, looking certain she had misunderstood. The camerlegno looked troubled, as if he were 
      the brunt of a cruel joke. "You expect me to believe this information is in our archives?" 
      "I can't promise I can locate it in time, but if you let me in..." 
      "Mr. Langdon, I am due in the Sistine Chapel in four minutes. The archives are across Vatican City."  
      "You're serious aren't you?" Vittoria interrupted, staring deep into Langdon's eyes, seeming to sense his 
      earnestness.  
      "Hardly a joking time," Langdon said. 
      "Father," Vittoria said, turning to the camerlegno, "if there's a chance... any at all of finding where 
      these killings are going to happen, we could stake out the locations and-" 
      "But the archives?" the camerlegno insisted. "How could they possibly contain any clue?" 
      "Explaining it," Langdon said, "will take longer than you've got. But if I'm right, we can use the 
      information to catch the Hassassin."  
      The camerlegno looked as though he wanted to believe but somehow could not. 
      "Christianity's most sacred codices are in that archive. Treasures I myself am not privileged enough to 
      see." 
      "I am aware of that." 
      "Access is permitted only by written decree of the curator and the Board of Vatican Librarians." 
      "Or," Langdon declared, "by papal mandate. It says so in every rejection letter your curator ever sent 
      me." 
      The camerlegno nodded. 
      "Not to be rude," Langdon urged, "but if I'm not mistaken a papal mandate comes from this office. As 
      far as I can tell, tonight you hold the trust of his station. Considering the circumstances..." 
      The camerlegno pulled a pocket watch from his cassock and looked at it. "Mr. Langdon, I am prepared 
      to give my life tonight, quite literally, to save this church." 
      Langdon sensed nothing but truth in the man's eyes. 
      "This document," the camerlegno said, "do you truly believe it is here? And that it can help us locate 
      these four churches?" 
      "I would not have made countless solicitations for access if I were not convinced. Italy is a bit far to 
      come on a lark when you make a teacher's salary. The document you have is an ancient-" 
      "Please," the camerlegno interrupted. "Forgive me. My mind cannot process any more details at the 
      moment. Do you know where the secret archives are located?" 
      Langdon felt a rush of excitement. "Just behind the Santa Ana Gate." 
      "Impressive. Most scholars believe it is through the secret door behind St. Peter's Throne." 
      "No. That would be the Archivio della Reverenda di Fabbrica di S. Pietro. A common misconception." 
      "A librarian docent accompanies every entrant at all times. Tonight, the docents are gone. What you 
      are requesting is carte blanch e access. Not even our cardinals enter alone." 
                         93  
                           46 
        
       
      The Secret Vatican Archives are located at the far end of the Borgia Courtyard directly up a hill from 
      the Gate of Santa A na. They contain over 20,000 volumes and are rumored to hold such treasures as 
      Leonardo da Vinci's missing diaries and even unpublished books of the Holy Bible. 
      Langdon strode powerfully up the deserted Via della Fondamenta toward the archives, his mind barely 
      able to accept that he was about to be granted access. Vittoria was at his side, keeping pace effortlessly. 
      Her almond-scented hair tossed lightly in the breeze, and Langdon breathed it in. He felt his thoughts 
      straying and reeled himself back.  
      Vittoria said, "You going to tell me what we're looking for?" 
      "A little book written by a guy named Galileo." 
      She sounded surprised. "You don't mess around. What's in it?" 
      "It is supposed to contain something called il segno." 
      "The sign?"  
      "Sign, clue, signal...  depends on your translation." 
      "Sign to what?" 
      Langdon picked up the pace. "A secret location. Galileo's Illuminati needed to protect themselves from 
      the Vatican, so they founded an ultrasecret Illuminati meeting place here in Rome. They called it The 
      Church of Illumination."  
      "Pretty bold calling a satanic lair a church."  
      Langdon shook his head. "Galileo's Illuminati were not the least bit satanic. They were scientists who 
      revered enlightenment. Their meeting place was simply where they could safely congregate and discuss  
      topics forbidden by the Vatican. Although we know the secret lair existed, to this day nobody has ever 
      located it." 
      "Sounds like the Illuminati know how to keep a secret." 
      "Absolutely. In fact, they never revealed the location of their hideaway to anyone outside the 
      brotherhood. This secrecy protected them, but it also posed a problem when it came to 
      recruiting new members." 
      "They couldn't grow if they couldn't advertise," Vittoria said, her legs and mind keeping perfect pace. 
      "Exactly. Word of Galileo's brotherhood started to spread in the 1630s, and scientists from around the 
      world made secret pilgrimages to Rome hoping to join the Illuminati... eager for a chance to look 
      through Galileo's telescope and hear the master's ideas. Unfortunately, though, because of the 
      Illuminati's secrecy, scientists arriving in Rome never knew where to go for the meetings or to whom 
      they could safely speak. The Illuminati wanted new blood, but they could not afford to risk their 
      secrecy by making their whereabouts known."  
      Vittoria frowned. "Sounds like a situazione senza soluzione."  
      "Exactly. A catch -22, as we would say." 
      "So what did they do?"  
      "They were scientists. They examined the problem and found a solution. A brilliant one, actually. The 
      Illuminati created a kind of ingenious map directing scientists to their sanctuary." 
      Vittoria looked suddenly skeptical and slowed. "A map? Sounds careless. If a copy fell into the wrong 
      hands..."  
      "It couldn't," Langdon said. "No copies existed anywhere. It was not the kind of map that fit on paper. 
      It was enormous. A blazed trail of sorts across the city." 
      Vittoria slowed even further. "Arrows painted on sidewalks?" 
      "In a sense, yes, but much more subtle. The map consisted of a series of carefully concealed symbolic 
      markers placed in public locations around the city. One marker led to the next... and the next... a trail... 
      eventually leading to the Illuminati lair." 
      Vittoria eyed him askance. "Sounds like a treasure hunt." 
                         95  
      Langdon smiled as he played his ace. "Oh, yes. The Illuminati called these four churches by a very 
      special name. The Altars of Science." 
      Vittoria frowned. "I'm sorry, that means noth-" She stopped short. "L'altare di scienza?" she exclaimed. 
      "The Illuminati assassin. He warned that the cardinals would be virgin sacrifices on the altars of  
      science!"  
      Langdon gave her a smile. "Four cardinals. Four churches. The four altars of science." 
      She looked stunned. "You're saying the four churches where the cardinals will be sacrificed are the 
      same four  churches that mark the ancient Path of Illumination?" 
      "I believe so, yes." 
      "But why would the killer have given us that clue?" 
      "Why not?" Langdon replied. "Very few historians know about these sculptures. Even fewer believe 
      they exist. And their locations have remained secret for four hundred years. No doubt the Illuminati 
      trusted the secret for another five hours. Besides, the Illuminati don't need their Path of Illumination 
      anymore. Their secret lair is probably long gone anyway. They live in the modern world. They meet in 
      bank boardrooms, eating clubs, private golf courses. Tonight they want to make their secrets public. 
      This is their moment. Their grand unveiling." 
      Langdon feared the Illuminati unveiling would have a special symmetry to it that he had not yet 
      mentioned. The four brands. The killer had sworn each cardinal would be branded with a different 
      symbol. Proof the ancient legends are true, the killer had said. The legend of the four ambigrammatic 
      brands was as old as the Illuminati itself: earth, air, fire, water-four words crafted in perfect symmetry. 
      Just like the word Illuminati. Each cardinal was to be branded with one of the ancient elements of 
      science. The rumor that the four brands were in English rather than Italian remained a point of debate 
      among historians. English seemed a random deviation from their natural tongue... and the Illuminati 
      did nothing randomly.  
      Langdon turned up the brick pathway before the archive building. Ghastly images thrashed in his 
      mind.  
      The overall Illuminati plot was starting to reveal its patient grandeur. The brotherhood had vowed to 
      stay silent as long as it took, amassing enough influence and power that they could resurface without 
      fear, make their stand, fight their cause in broad daylight. The Illuminati were no longer about hiding. 
      They were about flaunting their power, confirming the conspiratorial myths as fact. Tonight was a 
      global publicity stunt. 
      Vittoria said, "Here comes our escort." Langdon looked up to see a Swiss Guard hurrying across an 
      adjacent lawn toward the front door.  
      When the guard saw them, he stopped in his tracks. He stared at them, as though he thought he was 
      hallucinating. Without a word he turned away and pulled out his walkie-talkie. Apparently incredulous 
      at what he was being asked to do, the guard spoke urgently to the person on the other end. The angry 
      bark coming back was indecipherable to Langdon, but its message was clear. The guard slumped, put 
      away the walkie-talkie, and turned to them with a look of discontent. Not a word was spoken as the 
      guard guided them into the building. They passed through four steel doors, two passkey entries, down 
      a long stairwell, and into a foyer with two combination keypads. Passing through a high-tech series of 
      electronic gates, they arrived at the end of a long hallway outside a set of wide oak double doors. The 
      guard stopped, looked them over again and, mumbling under his breath, walked to a metal box on the 
      wall. He unlocked it, reached inside, and pressed a code. The doors before them buzzed, and the 
      deadbolt fell open. The guard turned, speaking to them for the first time. "The archives are beyond 
      that door. I have been instructed to escort you this far and return for briefing on another matter." 
      "You're leaving?" Vittoria demanded.  
      "Swiss Guards are not cleared for access to the Secret Archives. You are here only because my 
      commander received a direct order from the camerlegno." 
      "But how do we get out?" 
      "Monodirectional security. You will have no difficulties." That being the entirety of the conversation, 
      the guard spun on his heel and marched off down the hall. 
      Vittoria made some comment, but Langdon did not hear. His mind was fixed on the double doors 
      before him, wondering what mysteries lay beyond. 
                         97  
      while on vacation. Thirty -seven people had died, including Carlo's mother. The papers called Carlo's 
      survival The Miracle of St. Francis. 
      Carlo had, for some unknown reason, only moments before the blast, left his mother's side and 
      ventured into a protected alcove to ponder a tapestry depicting the story of St. Francis. God called me 
      there, he decided. He wanted to save me. 
      Carlo was delirious with pain. He could still see his mother, kneeling at the pew, blowing him a kiss, 
      and then with a concussive roar, her sweet-smelling flesh was torn apart. He could still taste man's evil. 
      Blood showered down. His mother's blood! The blessed Maria! God will watch over you and protect 
      you forever, his mother had told him. But where was God now! Then, like a worldly manifestation of 
      his mother's truth, a clergyman had come to the hospital. He was not any clergyman. He was a bishop. 
      He prayed over Carlo. The Miracle of St. Francis. When Carlo recovered, the bishop arranged for him 
      to live in a small monastery attached to the cathedral over which the bishop presided. Carlo lived and 
      tutored with the monks. He even became an altar boy for his new protector. The bishop suggested 
      Carlo enter public school, but Carlo refused. He could not have been more happy with his new home. 
      He now truly lived in the house of God. Every night Carlo prayed for his mother. God saved me for a 
      reason, he thought. What is the reason? 
      When Carlo turned sixteen, he was obliged by Italian law to serve two years of reserve military training. 
      The bishop told Carlo that if he entered seminary he would be exempt from this duty. Carlo told the 
      priest that he planned to enter seminary but that first he needed to understand evil. The bishop did not 
      understand. Carlo told him that if he was going to spend his life in the church fighting evil, first he had 
      to understand it. He could not think of any better place to understand evil than in the army. The army 
      used guns and b ombs. A bomb killed my Blessed mother! The bishop tried to dissuade him, but 
      Carlo's mind was made up.  
      "Be careful, my son," the bishop had said. "And remember the church awaits you when you return." 
      Carlo's two years of military service had been dreadful. Carlo's youth had been one of silence and 
      reflection. But in the army there was no quiet for reflection. Endless noise. Huge machines everywhere. 
      Not a moment of peace. Although the soldiers went to Mass once a week at the barracks, Carlo did not 
      sense G od's presence in any of his fellow soldiers. Their minds were too filled with chaos to see God. 
      Carlo hated his new life and wanted to go home. But he was determined to stick it out. He had yet to 
      understand evil. He refused to fire a gun, so the military taught him how to fly a medical helicopter. 
      Carlo hated the noise and the smell, but at least it let him fly up in the sky and be closer to his mother 
      in heaven.  
      When he was informed his pilot's training included learning how to parachute, Carlo was terrified. Still, 
      he had no choice. God will protect me, he told himself. 
      Carlo's first parachute jump was the most exhilarating physical experience of his life. It was like flying 
      with God. Carlo could not get enough... the silence... the floating... seeing his mother's face in the 
      billowing white clouds as he soared to earth. God has plans for you, Carlo. When he returned from the 
      military, Carlo entered the seminary. That had been twenty-three years ago. 
      Now, as Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca descended the Royal Staircase, he tried to comprehend the chain 
      of events that had delivered him to this extraordinary crossroads. Abandon all fear, he told himself, 
      and give this night over to God. He could see the great bronze door of the Sistine Chapel now,  
      dutifully protected by four Swiss Guards. 
      The guards unbolted the door and pulled it open. Inside, every head turned. The camerlegno gazed out 
      at the black robes and red sashes before him. He understood what God's plans for him were. The fate 
      of the church had been placed in his hands.  
      The camerlegno crossed himself and stepped over the threshold.  
                         99  
                           49 
        
       
      Langdon and Vittoria stood alone now outside the double doors that led to the inner sanctum of the 
      Secret Archives.  The decor in the colonnade was an incongruous mix of wall-to-wall carpets over 
      marble floors and wireless security cameras gazing down from beside carved cherubs in the ceiling. 
      Langdon dubbed it Sterile Renaissance. Beside the arched ingress hung a small bronze plaque. 
      ARCHIVIO VATICANO 
      Curatore, Padre Jaqui Tomaso  
      Father Jaqui Tomaso. Langdon recognized the curator's name from the rejection letters at home in his 
      desk. Dear Mr. Langdon, It is with regret that I am writing to deny... Regret. Bullshit. Since Jaqui 
      Tomaso's reign had begun, Langdon had never met a single non-Catholic American scholar who had 
      been given access to the Secret Vatican Archives. Il gaurdiano, historians called him. Jaqui Tomaso was 
      the toughest librarian on earth. As Langdon pushed the doors open and stepped through the vaulted 
      portal into the inner sanctum, he half expected to see Father Jaqui in full military fatigues and helmet 
      standing guard with a bazooka. The space, however, was deserted. Silence. Soft lighting. Archivio 
      Vaticano. One of his life dreams. 
      As Langdon's eyes took in the sacred chamber, his first reaction was one of embarrassment. He 
      realized what a callow romantic he was. The images he had held for so many years of this room could 
      not have been more inaccurate. He had imagined dusty bookshelves piled high with tattered volumes, 
      priests cataloging by the light of candles and stained-glass windows, monks poring over scrolls... Not 
      even close.  
      At first glance the room appeared to be a darkened airline hangar in which someone had built a dozen 
      freestanding racquetball courts. Langdon knew of course what the glass-walled enclosures were. He 
      was not surprised to see them; humidity and heat eroded ancient vellums and parchments, and proper 
      preservation required hermitic vaults like these -airtight cubicles that kept out humidity and natural 
      acids in the air. 
      Langdon had been inside hermetic vaults many times, but it was always an unsettling experience... 
      something about entering an airtight container where the oxygen was regulated by a reference librarian. 
      The vaults were dark, ghostly even, faintly outlined by tiny dome lights at the end of each stack. In the 
      blackness of each cell, Langdon sensed the phantom giants, row upon row of towering stacks, laden 
      with history. Thi s was one hell of a collection.  
      Vittoria also seemed dazzled. She stood beside him staring mutely at the giant transparent cubes. 
      Time was short, and Langdon wasted none of it scanning the dimly lit room for a book catalog-a 
      bound encyclopedia that cataloged the library's collection. All he saw was the glow of a handful of 
      computer terminals dotting the room.  
      "Looks like they've got a Biblion. Their index is computerized." 
      Vittoria looked hopeful. "That should speed things up." 
      Langdon wished he shared her enthusiasm, but he sensed this was bad news. He walked to a terminal 
      and began typing. His fears were instantly confirmed. "The old-fashioned method would have been 
      better." 
      "Why?" 
      He stepped back from the monitor. "Because real books don't have password protection. I don't 
      suppose physicists are natural born hackers?" 
      Vittoria shook her head. "I can open oysters, that's about it." 
      Langdon took a deep breath and turned to face the eerie collection of diaphanous vaults. He walked to 
      the nearest one and squinted into the dim interior. Inside the glass were amorphous shapes Langdon 
      recognized as the usual bookshelves, parchment bins, and examination tables. He looked up at the 
      indicator tabs glowing at the end of each stack. As in all libraries, the tabs indicated the contents of that 
      row. He read the headings as he moved down the transparent barrier. 
      PIETRO IL ERIMITO... LE CROCIATE... URBANO II... LEVANT... 
                         Angels & Demons      101  
      "666?"  
      Langdon smiled. "Actually it's 503." 
      "Meaning?"  
      "None of us could ever figure it out. I became fascinated with 503, trying everything to find meaning in 
      the number -numerology, map references, latitudes." Langdon reached the end of the aisle, turned the 
      corner, and hurried to scan the next row of tabs as he spoke. "For many years the only clue seemed to 
      be that 503 began with the number five... one of the sacred Illuminati digits." He paused.  
      "Something tells me you recently figured it out, and that's why we're here." 
      "Correct," Langdon said, allowing himself a rare moment of pride in his work. 
      "Are you familiar with a book by Galileo called Di��logo?" 
      "Of course. Famous among scientists as the ultimate scientific sellout." 
      Sellout wasn't quite the word Langdon would have used, but he knew what Vittoria meant. In the early 
      1630s, Galileo had wanted to publish a book endorsing the Copernican heliocentric model of the solar 
      system, but the Vatican would not permit the book's release unless Galileo included equally persuasive 
      evidence for the church's geocentric model-a model Galileo knew to be dead wrong. Galileo had no 
      choice but to acquiesce to the church's demands and publish a book giving equal time to both the 
      accurate and inaccurate models. 
      "As you probably know," Langdon said, "despite Galileo's compromise, Di��logo was still seen as 
      heretical, and the Vatican placed him under house arrest." 
      "No good deed goes unpunished." 
      Langdon smiled. "So true. And yet Galileo was persistent. While under house arrest, he secretly wrote a 
      lesser -known manuscript that scholars often confuse with Di��logo. That book is called Discorsi." 
      Vittoria nodded. "I've heard of it. Discourses on the Tides." 
      Langdon stopped short, amazed she had heard of the obscure publication about planetary motion and 
      its effect on the tides. 
      "Hey," she said, "you're talking to an Italian marine physicist whose father worshiped Galileo." 
      Langdon laughed. Discorsi however was not what they were looking for. Langdon explained that 
      Discorsi had not been Galileo's only work while under house arrest. Historians believed he had also 
      written an obscure booklet called Diagramma. 
      "Diagramma della Verit��," Langdon said. "Diagram of Truth."  
      "Never heard of it." 
      "I'm not surprised. Diagramma was Galileo's most secretive work-supposedly some sort of treatise on 
      scientific facts he held to be true but was not allowed to share. Like some of Galileo's previous 
      manuscripts, Diagramma was smuggled out of Rome by a friend and quietly published in Holland. The 
      booklet became wildly popular in the European scientific underground. Then the Vatican caught wind 
      of it and went on a book-burning campaign."  
      Vittoria now looked intrigued. "And you think Diagramma contained the clue? The segno. The 
      information about the Path of Illumination." 
      "Diagramma is how Galileo got the word out. That I'm sure of." Langdon entered the third row of 
      vaults and continued surveying the indicator tabs. "Archivists have been looking for a copy of 
      Diagramma for years. But between the Vatican burnings and the booklet's low permanence rating, 
      the booklet has disappeared off the face of the earth." 
      "Permanence rating?" 
      "Durability. Archivists rate documents one through ten for their structural integrity. Diagramma was  
      printed on sedge papyrus. It's like tissue paper. Life span of no more than a century." 
      "Why not something stronger?" 
      "Galileo's behest. To protect his followers. This way any scientists caught with a copy could simply 
      drop it in water and the booklet would dissolve. It was great for destruction of evidence, but terrible 
      for archivists. It is believed that only one copy of Diagramma survived beyond the eighteenth 
      century."  
      "One?" Vittoria looked momentarily  starstruck as she glanced around the room. 
      "And it's here?" 
                         Angels & Demons      103  
      "You don't sound sold," Langdon said, moving down the row. 
      "I'm not. Mainly because you aren't. If you were so sure about DIII, why didn't you publish? Then 
      someone who did have access to the Vatican Archives could have come in here and checked out 
      Diagramma a long time ago." 
      "I didn't want to publish," Langdon said. "I had worked hard to find the information and-" He stopped 
      himself, embarrassed.  
      "You wanted the glory." 
      Langdon felt himself flush. "In a manner of speaking. It's just that-" 
      "Don't look so embarrassed. You're talking to a scientist. Publish or perish. At CERN we call it 
      'Substantiate or suffocate.' " 
      "It wasn't only wanting to be the first. I was also concerned that if the wrong people found out about 
      the information in Diagramma, it might disappear." 
      "The wrong people being the Vatican?" 
      "Not that they are wrong, per se, but the church has always downplayed the Illuminati threat. In the 
      early 1900s the Vatican went so far as to say the Illuminati were a figment of overactive imaginations. 
      The clergy felt, and perhaps rightly so, that the last thing Christians needed to know was that there was 
      a very powe rful anti-Christian movement infiltrating their banks, politics, and universities." Present 
      tense, Robert, he reminded himself. There IS a powerful anti-Christian force infiltrating their banks, 
      politics, and universities.  
      "So you think the Vatican would h ave buried any evidence corroborating the Illuminati threat?" 
      "Quite possibly. Any threat, real or imagined, weakens faith in the church's power." 
      "One more question." Vittoria stopped short and looked at him like he was an alien. "Are you 
      serious?" 
      Langdon stopped. "What do you mean?" 
      "I mean is this really your plan to save the day?" 
      Langdon wasn't sure whether he saw amused pity or sheer terror in her eyes. "You mean finding 
      Diagramma?"  
      "No, I mean finding Diagramma, locating a four-hundred-year-old segno, deciphering some 
      mathematical code, and following an ancient trail of art that only the most brilliant scientists in history 
      have ever been able to follow... all in the next four hours." 
      Langdon shrugged. "I'm open to other suggestions." 
                         Angels & Demons      105  
      Langdon waited for her to acclimatize. He knew she would be fine. Vittoria Vetra was obviously in 
      terrific shape, nothing like the doddering ancient Radcliffe alumnae Langdon had once squired through 
      Widener Library's hermetic vault. The tour had ended with Langdon giving mouth-to-mouth to an old 
      woman who'd almost aspirated her false teeth. 
      "Feeling better?" he asked. 
      Vittoria nodded. 
      "I rode your damn space plane, so I thought I owed you." 
      This brought a smile. "Touch��." 
      Langdon reached into the box beside the door and extracted some white cotton gloves. 
      "Formal affair?" Vittoria asked. 
      "Finger acid. We can't handle the documents without them. You'll need a pair." 
      Vittoria donned some gloves. "How long do we have?" 
      Langdon checked his Mickey Mouse watch. "It's just past seven." 
      "We have to find this thing within the hour." 
      "Actually," Langdo n said, "we don't have that kind of time." He pointed overhead to a filtered duct. 
      "Normally the curator would turn on a reoxygenation system when someone is inside the vault. Not 
      today. Twenty minutes, we'll both be sucking wind." 
      Vittoria blanched noticeably in the reddish glow.  
      Langdon smiled and smoothed his gloves. "Substantiate or suffocate, Ms. Vetra. Mickey's ticking." 
                         Angels & Demons      107  
                           52 
        
       
      The internal organization of Archival Vault 10 was not as intuitive as Langdon had hoped, and the 
      Diagramma manuscript did not appear to be located with other similar Galilean publications. Without 
      access to the computerized Biblion and a reference locator, Langdon and Vittoria were stuck. 
      "You're sure Diagramma is in here?" Vittoria asked. 
      "Positive. It's a confirmed listing in both the Uficcio della Propaganda delle Fede-" 
      "Fine. As long a s you're sure." She headed left, while he went right. 
      Langdon began his manual search. He needed every bit of self-restraint not to stop and read every 
      treasure he passed. The collection was staggering. The Assayer... The Starry Messenger... The Sunspot 
      Letters... Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina... Apologia pro Galileo... On and on. 
      It was Vittoria who finally struck gold near the back of the vault. Her throaty voice called out, 
      "Diagramma della Verit��!" 
      Langdon dashed through the crimson haze to join her. "Where?"  
      Vittoria pointed, and Langdon immediately realized why they had not found it earlier. The manuscript 
      was in a folio bin, not on the shelves. Folio bins were a common means of storing unbound pages. The 
      label on the front of the container left no doubt about the contents. 
      DIAGRAMMA DELLA VERITA  
      Galileo Galilei, 1639  
      Langdon dropped to his knees, his heart pounding. "Diagramma." He gave her a grin. "Nice work. 
      Help me pull out this bin."  
      Vittoria knelt beside him, and they heaved. The metal tray on which the bin was sitting rolled toward 
      them on castors, revealing the top of the container. 
      "No lock?" Vittoria said, sounding surprised at the simple latch. 
      "Never. Documents sometimes need to be evacuated quickly. Floods and fires." 
      "So open it."  
      Langdon didn't need any encouragement. With his academic life's dream right in front of him and the 
      thinning air in the chamber, he was in no mood to dawdle. He unsnapped the latch and lifted the lid. 
      Inside, flat on the floor of the bin, lay a black, duck-cloth pouch. The cloth's breathability was critical 
      to the preservation of its contents. Reaching in with both hands and keeping the pouch horizontal, 
      Langdon lifted it out of the bin. 
      "I expected a treasure chest," Vittoria said. "Looks more like a pillowcase."  
      "Follow me," he said. Holding the bag before him like a sacred offering, Langdon walked to the center 
      of the vault where he found the customary glass-topped archival exam table. Although the central 
      location was intended to minimize in-vault travel of documents, researchers appreciated the privacy the 
      surrounding stacks afforded. Career-making discoveries were uncovered in the top vaults of the world, 
      and most academics did not like rivals peering through the glass as they worked.  
      Langdon lay the pouch on the table and unbuttoned the opening. Vittoria stood by. Rummaging 
      through a tray of archivist tools, Langdon found the felt-pad pincers archivists called finger cymbals-
      oversized tweezers with flattened disks on each arm. As his excitement mounted, Langdon feared at 
      any moment he might awake back in Cambridge with a pile of test papers to grade. Inhaling deeply, he 
      opened the bag. Fingers trembling in their cotton gloves, he reached in with his tongs. 
      "Relax," Vittoria said. "It's paper, not plutoni um." 
      Langdon slid the tongs around the stack of documents inside and was careful to apply even pressure. 
      Then, rather than pulling out the documents, he held them in place while he slid off the bag-an 
      archivist's procedure for minimizing torque on the artifact. Not until the bag was removed and 
      Langdon had turned on the exam darklight beneath the table did he begin breathing again. 
      Vittoria looked like a specter now, lit from below by the lamp beneath the glass. "Small sheets," she 
      said, her voice reverent. 
                         Angels & Demons      109  
      Langdon refused to accept defeat so quickly. "The numbers must be written longhand. The math must 
      be in words rather than equations." 
      "It'll take some time to read all the pages." 
      "Time's something we don't have. We'll have to split the work." Langdon flipped the stack back over 
      to the beginning. "I know enough Italian to spot numbers." Using his spatula, he cut the stack like a 
      deck of cards and lay the first half-dozen pages in front of Vittoria. "It's in here somewhere. I'm sure." 
      Vittoria reached down and flipped her first page by hand.  
      "Spatula!" Langdon said, grabbing her an extra tool from the tray. "Use the spatula." 
      "I'm wearing gloves," she grumbled. "How much damage could I cause?" 
      "Just use it." 
      Vittoria picked up the spatula. "You feeling what I'm feeling?" 
      "Tense?"  
      "No. Short of breath." 
      Langdon was definitely starting to feel it too. The air was thinning faster than he had imagined. He 
      knew they had to hurry. Archival conundrums were nothing new for him, but usually he had more than 
      a few minutes to work them out. Without another word, Langdon bowed his head and began 
      translating the first page in his stack. 
      Show yourself, damn it! Show yourself! 
                         Angels & Demons      111  
                           54 
        
       
      Inside Archive Vault 10 Robert Langdon recited Italian numbers as he scanned the calligraphy before 
      him. Mille... centi... uno, duo, tre... cincuanta. I need a numerical reference! Anything, damnit! When he 
      reached the end of his current folio, he lifted the spatula to flip the page. As he aligned the blade 
      with the next page, he fumbled, having difficulty holding the tool steady. 
      Minutes later, he looked down and realized he had abandoned his spatula and was turning pages by 
      hand. Oops, he thought, feeling vaguely criminal. The lack of oxygen was affecting his inhibitions. 
      Looks like I'll burn in archivist's hell. 
      "About damn time," Vittoria choked when she saw Langdon turning pages by hand. 
      She dropped her spatula and followed suit. 
      "Any luck?" 
      Vittoria shook her head. "Nothing that looks purely mathematical. I'm skimming... but none of this 
      reads like a clue."  
      Langdon conti nued translating his folios with increasing difficulty. His Italian skills were rocky at best, 
      and the tiny penmanship and archaic language was making it slow going. Vittoria reached the end of 
      her stack before Langdon and looked disheartened as she flipped the pages back over. She hunkered 
      down for another more intense inspection. 
      When Langdon finished his final page, he cursed under his breath and looked over at Vittoria. She was 
      scowling, squinting at something on one of her folios. "What is it?" he asked. 
      Vittoria did not look up. "Did you have any footnotes on your pages?" 
      "Not that I noticed. Why?" 
      "This page has a footnote. It's obscured in a crease." 
      Langdon tried to see what she was looking at, but all he could make out was the page number in the 
      upper right-hand corner of the sheet. Folio 5. It took a moment for the coincidence to register, and 
      even when it did the connection seemed vague. Folio Five. Five, Pythagoras, pentagrams, Illuminati. 
      Langdon wondered if the Illuminati would have chosen page five on which to hide their clue. Through 
      the reddish fog surrounding them, Langdon sensed a tiny ray of hope. "Is the footnote mathematical?" 
      Vittoria shook her head. "Text. One line. Very small printing. Almost illegible." 
      His hopes faded. "It's supposed to be math. Lingua pura." 
      "Yeah, I know." She hesitated. "I think you'll want to hear this, though." 
      Langdon sensed excitement in her voice. 
      "Go ahead."  
      Squinting at the folio, Vittoria read the line. "The path of light is laid, the sacred test." 
      The wor ds were nothing like what Langdon had imagined. "I'm sorry?" 
      Vittoria repeated the line. "The path of light is laid, the sacred test." 
      "Path of light?" Langdon felt his posture straightening. 
      "That's what it says. Path of light." 
      As the words sank in, Langdon felt his delirium pierced by an instant of clarity. The path of light is laid, 
      the sacred test. He had no idea how it helped them, but the line was as direct a reference to the Path of 
      Illumination as he could imagine. Path of light. Sacred test. His head felt like an engine revving on bad 
      fuel. "Are you sure of the translation?" 
      Vittoria hesitated. "Actually..." She glanced over at him with a strange look. "It's not technically a 
      translation. The line is written in English."  
      For an instant, Langdon thought the acoustics in the chamber had affected his hearing. "English?" 
      Vittoria pushed the document over to him, and Langdon read the minuscule printing at the bottom of 
      the page. "The path of light is laid, the sacred test. English? What is English doing in an Italian book?"  
      Vittoria shrugged. She too was looking tipsy. "Maybe English is what they meant by the lingua pura? 
      It's considered the international language of science. It's all we speak at CERN." 
      "But this was in the 1600s," Langdon argued. "Nobody spoke English in Italy, not even-" He stopped 
      short, realizing what he was about to say. "Not even... the clergy." Langdon's academic mind hummed 
                         Angels & Demons      113  
      wrote the poem as a favor?" 
      Langdon clenched his teeth as he took the sheathed document. Leaving it flat on the table, he read the 
      line at the top. Then he rotated the page 90 degrees, reading the line in the right margin. Another twist, 
      and he read the bottom. Another twist, the left. A final twist completed the circle. There were four 
      lines in all. The first line Vittoria had found was actually the third line of the poem. Utterly agape, he 
      read the four lines again, clockwise in sequence: top, right, bottom, left. When he was done, he exhaled. 
      There was no doubt in his mind. "You found it, Ms. Vetra."  
      She smiled tightly. "Good, now can we get the hell out of here?" 
      "I have to copy these lines down. I need to find a pencil and paper." 
      Vittoria shook her head. "Forget it, professor. No time to play scribe. Mickey's ticking." She took the 
      page from him and headed for the door. 
      Langdon stood up. "You can't take that outside! It's a-" 
      But Vittoria was already gone.  
                         Angels & Demons      115  
      Langdon chuckled to himself. He was amazed how few people knew Santi, the last name of one of the 
      most famous Renaissance artists ever to live. His first name was world renowned... the child prodigy 
      who at the age of twenty-five was already doing commissions for Pope Julius II, and when he died at 
      only thirtyeight, left behind the greatest collection of frescoes the world had ever seen. Santi was a 
      behemoth in the art world, and being known solely by one's first name was a level of fame achieved 
      only by an elite few... people like Napoleon, Galileo, and Jesus... and, of course, the demigods Langdon 
      now heard blaring from Harvard dormitories-Sting, Madonna, Jewel, and the artist formerly known as 
      Prince, who had changed his name to the symbol , causing Langdon to dub him "The Tau Cross With 
      Intersecting Hermaphroditic Ankh." 
      "Santi," Langdon said, "is the last name of the great Renaissance master, Raphael." 
      Vittoria looked surprised. "Raphael? As in the Raphael?" 
      "The one and only." Langdon pushed on toward the Office of the Swiss Guard. 
      "So the path starts at Raphael's tomb?" 
      "It actually makes perfect sense," Langdon said as they rushed on. "The Illuminati often considered 
      great artists and sculptors honorary brothers in enlightenment. The Illuminati could have chosen 
      Raphael's tomb as a kind of tribute." Langdon also knew that Raphael, like many other religious artists, 
      was a suspected closet atheist. Vittoria slipped the folio carefully back in Langdon's pocket. "So where 
      is he buried?" 
      Langdon took a deep breath. "Believe it or not, Raphael's buried in the Pantheon." 
      Vittoria looked skeptical. "The Pantheon?" 
      "The Raphael at the Pantheon." Langdon had to admit, the Pantheon was not what he had expected 
      for the placement of the first marker. He would have guessed the first altar of science to be at some 
      quiet, out of the way church, something subtle. Even in the 1600s, the Pantheon, with its tremendous, 
      holed dome, was one of the best known sites in Rome. 
      "Is the Pantheon even a church?" Vittoria asked. 
      "Oldest Catholic church in Rome."  
      Vittoria shook her head. "But do you really think the first cardinal could be killed at the Pantheon? 
      That's got to be one of the busiest tourist spots in Rome."  
      Langdon shrugged. "The Illuminati said they wanted the whole world watching. Killing a cardinal at the 
      Pantheon would certainly open some eyes." 
      "But how does this guy expect to kill someone at the Pantheon and get away unnoticed? It would be  
      impossible."   
      "As impossible as kidnapping four cardinals from Vatican City? The poem is precise." 
      "And you're certain Raphael is buried inside the Pantheon?" 
      "I've seen his tomb many times." 
      Vittoria nodded, still looking troubled. "What time is it?" 
      Langdon checked. "Seven-thirty." 
      "Is the Pantheon far?" 
      "A mile maybe. We've got time." 
      "The poem said Santi's earthly tomb. Does that mean anything to you?" 
      Langdon hastened diagonally across the Courtyard of the Sentinel. "Earthly? Actually, there's probably 
      no more earthly place in Rome than the Pantheon. It got its name from the original religion practiced 
      there- Pantheism -the worship of all gods, specifically the pagan gods of Mother Earth." 
      As a student of architecture, Langdon had been amazed to learn that the dimensions of the Pantheon's 
      main chamber were a tribute to Gaea-the goddess of the Earth. The proportions were so exact that a 
      giant spherical globe could fit perfectly inside the building with less than a millimeter to spare. 
      "Okay," Vittoria said, sounding more convinced. "And demon's hole? From Santi's earthly tomb with 
      demon's hole?"  
      Langdon was not quite as sure about this. "Demon's hole must mean the oculus," he said, making a 
      logical guess. "The famous circular opening in the Pantheon's roof."  
      "But it's a church," Vittoria said, moving effortlessly beside him. "Why would they call the opening a 
      demon's hole?"  
                         Angels & Demons      117  
                           56 
        
       
      The four unmarked Alfa Romeo 155 T-Sparks roared down Via dei Coronari like fighter jets off a 
      runway. The vehicles carried twelve plainclothed Swiss Guards armed with Cherchi-Pardini 
      semiautomatics, local-radius nerve gas canisters, and long-range stun guns. The three sharpshooters 
      carried laser -sighted rifles.  
      Sitting in the passenger seat of the lead car, Olivetti turned backward toward Langdon and Vittoria. His 
      eyes were filled with rage. "You assured me a sound explanation, and this is what I get?" 
      Langdon felt cramped in the small car. "I understand your-" 
      "No, you don't understand!" Olivetti never raised his voice, but his intensity tripled. "I have just 
      removed a dozen of my best men from Vatican City on the eve of conclave. And I have done this to 
      stake out the Pantheon based on the testimony of some American I have never met who has just 
      interpreted a fourhundred -year-old poem. I have also just left the search for this antimatter weapon in 
      the hands of secondary officers." 
      Langdon resisted the urge to pull Folio 5 from his pocket and wave it in Olivetti's face. "All I know is 
      that the information  we found refers to Raphael's tomb, and Raphael's tomb is inside the Pantheon." 
      The officer behind the wheel nodded. "He's right, commander. My wife and I-" 
      "Drive," Olivetti snapped. He turned back to Langdon. "How could a killer accomplish an 
      assassination in such a crowded place and escape unseen?" 
      "I don't know," Langdon said. "But the Illuminati are obviously highly resourceful. They've broken 
      into both CERN and Vatican City. It's only by luck that we know where the first kill zone is. The 
      Pantheon is y our one chance to catch this guy." 
      "More contradictions," Olivetti said. "One chance? I thought you said there was some sort of pathway. 
      A series of markers. If the Pantheon is the right spot, we can follow the pathway to the other markers. 
      We will have fo ur chances to catch this guy." 
      "I had hoped so," Langdon said. "And we would have... a century ago." 
      Langdon's realization that the Pantheon was the first altar of science had been a bittersweet moment. 
      History had a way of playing cruel tricks on those who chased it. It was a long shot that the Path of 
      Illumination would be intact after all of these years, with all of its statues in place, but part of Langdon 
      had fantasized about following the path all the way to the end and coming face to face with the sacred 
      Illuminati lair. Alas, he realized, it was not to be. "The Vatican had all the statues in the Pantheon 
      removed and destroyed in the late 1800s." 
      Vittoria looked shocked. "Why?" 
      "The statues were pagan Olympian Gods. Unfortunately, that means the first marker is gone... and with 
      it-" 
      "Any hope," Vittoria said, "of finding the Path of Illumination and additional markers?" 
      Langdon shook his head. "We have one shot. The Pantheon. After that, the path disappears." 
      Olivetti stared at them both a long moment and then turned and faced front.  
      "Pull over," he barked to the driver. 
      The driver swerved the car toward the curb and put on the brakes. Three other Alfa Romeos skidded 
      in behind them. The Swiss Guard convoy screeched to a halt. 
      "What are you doing!" Vittoria demanded.  
      "My job," Olivetti said, turning in his seat, his voice like stone. "Mr. Langdon, when you told me you 
      would explain the situation en route, I assumed I would be approaching the Pantheon with a clear idea 
      of why my men are here. That is not the case. Because I am abandoning critical duties by being here, 
      and because I have found very little that makes sense in this theory of yours about virgin sacrifices and 
      ancient poetry, I cannot in good conscience continue. I am recalling this mission immediately." He 
      pulled out his walkie-talkie and clicked it on. Vittoria reached across the seat and grabbed his arm. 
      "You can't!"  
      Olivetti slammed down the walkie -talkie and fixed her with a red-hot stare.  
      "Have you been to the Pantheon, Ms. Vetra?"

      The director of CERN, Maximilian Kohler, opened his eyes to the cool rush of cromolyn and 
      leukotriene in his body, dilating his bronchial tubes and pulmonary capillaries. He was breathing 
      normally again. He found himself lying in a private room in the CERN infirmary, his wheelchair beside 
      the bed. He took stock, examining the paper robe they had put him in. His clothing was folded on the 
      chair beside the bed. Outside he could hear a nurse making the rounds. He lay there a long minute 
      listening. Then, as quietly as possible, he pulled himself to the edge of the bed and retrieved his 
      clothing. Struggling with his dead legs, he dressed himself. Then he dragged his body onto his 
      wheelchair. 
      Muffling a cough, he wheeled himself to the door. He moved manually, careful not to engage the 
      motor. When he arrived at the door he peered out. The hall was empty. Silently, Maximilian Kohler 
      slipped out of the infirmary. 
                         Angels & Demons      121  
      "Too dangerous. We would have no lines of communication with you. I can't let you carry a walkie-
      talkie, it would give you away." 
      Vittoria reached in her shirt pocket and produced her cell phone. "Plenty of tourists carry phones." 
      Olivetti frowned. 
      Vittoria unsnapped the phone and mimicked a call. "Hi, honey, I'm standing in the Pantheon. You 
      should see this place!" She snapped the phone shut and glared at Olivetti. "Who the hell is going to 
      know? It is a no-risk situation. Let me be your eyes!" She motioned to the cell phone on Olivetti's belt. 
      "What's your number?"  
      Olivetti did not reply. 
      The driver had been looking on and seemed to have some thoughts of his own. He got out of the car 
      and took the commander aside. They spoke in hushed tones for ten seconds. Finally Olivetti nodded 
      and returned. "Program this number." He began dictating digits. 
      Vittoria programmed her phone.  
      "Now call the number." 
      Vittoria pressed the auto dial. The phone on Olivetti's belt began ringing. He picked it up and spoke 
      into the receiver. "Go into the building, Ms. Vetra, look around, exit the building, then call and tell me 
      what you see." 
      Vittoria snapped the phone shut. "Thank you, sir." 
      Langdon felt a sudden, unexpected surge of protective instinct. "Wait a minute," 
      he said to Olivetti. 
      "You're sending her in there alone." 
      Vittoria scowled at him. "Robert, I'll be fine." 
      The Swiss Guard driver was talking to Olivetti again. 
      "It's dangerous," Langdon said to Vittoria. 
      "He's right," Olivetti said. "Even my best men don't work alone. My lieutenant has just pointed out 
      that the masquerade will be more convincing with both of you anyway." 
      Both of us? Langdon hesitated. Actually, what I meant-  
      "Both of you entering together," Olivetti said, "will look like a couple on holiday. You can also back 
      each other up. I'm more comfortable with that." 
      Vittoria shrugged. "Fine, but we'll need to go fast." 
      Langdon groaned. Nice move, cowboy. 
      Olivetti pointed down the street. "First street you hit will be Via degli Orfani. Go left. It takes you 
      directly to the Pantheon. Two-minute walk, tops. I'll be here, directing my men and waiting for your 
      call. I'd like you to have protection." He pulled out his pistol. "Do either of you know how to use a 
      gun?" Langdon's heart skipped. We don't need a gun! 
      Vittoria held her hand out. "I can tag a breaching porpoise from forty meters off the bow of a rocking 
      ship." 
      "Good." Olivetti handed the gun to her. "You'll have to conceal it." 
      Vittoria glanced down at her sho rts. Then she looked at Langdon. Oh no you don't! Langdon thought, 
      but Vittoria was too fast. She opened his jacket, and inserted the weapon into one of his breast 
      pockets. It felt like a rock dropping into his coat, his only consolation being that Diagramma was in the 
      other pocket.  
      "We look harmless," Vittoria said. "We're leaving." She took Langdon's arm and headed down the 
      street.  
      The driver called out, "Arm in arm is good. Remember, you're tourists. Newlyweds even. Perhaps if 
      you held hands?"  
      As they turned the corner Langdon could have sworn he saw on Vittoria's face the hint of a smile. 
                         Angels & Demons      123  
                           60 
        
       
      Two blocks from the Pantheon, Langdon and Vittoria approached on foot past a line of taxis, their 
      drivers sleeping in the front seats. Nap time was eternal in the Eternal City-the ubiquitous public 
      dozing a perfected extension of the afternoon siestas born of ancient Spain. 
      Langdon fought to focus his thoughts, but the situation was too bizarre to grasp rationally. Six hours 
      ago he had been sound asleep in Cambridge. Now he was in Europe, caught up in a surreal battle of 
      ancient titans, packing a semiautomatic in his Harris tweed, and holding hands with a woman he had 
      only just met. He looked at Vittoria. She was focused straight ahead. There was a strength in her grasp-
      that of an independent and determined woman. Her fingers wrapped around his with the comfort of 
      innate acceptance. No hesitation. Langdon felt a growing attraction. Get real, he told himself. 
      Vittoria seemed to sense his uneasiness. "Relax," she said, without turning her head. "We're supposed 
      to look like newlyweds." 
      "I'm relaxed."  
      "You're crushing my hand." 
      Langdon flushed and loosened up. 
      "Breathe through your eyes," she said. 
      "I'm sorry?"  
      "It relaxes the muscles. It's called pranayama." 
      "Piranha?" 
      "Not the fish. Pranayama. Never mind."  
      As they rounded the corner into Piazza della Rotunda, the Pantheon rose before them. Langdon 
      admired it, as always, with awe. The Pantheon. Temple to all gods. Pagan gods. Gods of Nature and 
      Earth. The structure seemed boxier from the outside than he remembered. The vertical pillars and 
      triangular pronaus all but obscured the circular dome behind it. Still, the bold and immodest inscription 
      over the entrance assured him they were in the right spot. M AGRIPPA L F COS TERTIUM FECIT. 
      Langdon tran slated it, as always, with amusement. Marcus Agrippa, Consul for the third time, built this. 
      So much for humility, he thought, turning his eyes to the surrounding area. A scattering of tourists with 
      video cameras wandered the area. Others sat enjoying Rome's best iced coffee at La Tazza di Oro's 
      outdoor cafe. Outside the entrance to the Pantheon, four armed Roman policemen stood at attention 
      just as Olivetti had predicted. 
      "Looks pretty quiet," Vittoria said.  
      Langdon nodded, but he felt troubled. Now that he was standing here in person, the whole scenario 
      seemed surreal. Despite Vittoria's apparent faith that he was right, Langdon realized he had put 
      everyone on the line here. The Illuminati poem lingered. From Santi's earthly tomb with demon's hole. 
      YES, he told himself. This was the spot. Santi's tomb. He had been here many times beneath the 
      Pantheon's oculus and stood before the grave of the great Raphael.  
      "What time is it?" Vittoria asked. 
      Langdon checked his watch. "Seven-fifty. Ten minutes till show time." 
      "Hope these guys are good," Vittoria said, eyeing the scattered tourists entering the Pantheon. "If 
      anything happens inside that dome, we'll all be in the crossfire." 
      Langdon exhaled heavily as they moved toward the entrance. The gun felt heavy in his pocket. He  
      wondered what would happen if the policemen frisked him and found the weapon, but the officers did 
      not give them a second look. Apparently the disguise was convincing. Langdon whispered to Vittoria. 
      "Ever fire anything other than a tranquilizer  gun?" 
      "Don't you trust me?"  
      "Trust you? I barely know you." 
      Vittoria frowned. "And here I thought we were newlyweds." 
                         Angels & Demons      125  
      "Brilliant. And how do you know he's a saint?" 
      "He's got a halo?"  
      "Excellent, and does that golden halo remind you of anything?" 
      Hitzrot broke into a smile. "Yeah! Those Egyptian things we studied last term. Those... um... sun 
      disks!" 
      "Thank you, Hitzrot. Go back to sleep." Langdon turned back to the class. 
      "Halos, like much of Christian symbology, were borrowed from the ancient Egyptian religion of sun 
      worship. Christianity is filled with examples of sun worship." 
      "Excuse  me?" the girl in front said. "I go to church all the time, and I don't see much sun worshiping 
      going on!" 
      "Really? What do you celebrate on December twenty-fifth?" 
      "Christmas. The birth of Jesus Christ." 
      "And yet according to the Bible, Christ was born in March, so what are we doing celebrating in late 
      December?"  
      Silence. 
      Langdon smiled. "December twenty-fifth, my friends, is the ancient pagan holiday of sol invictus- 
      Unconquered Sun -coinciding with the winter solstice. It's that wonderful time of year when the sun 
      returns, and the days start getting longer." 
      Langdon took another bite of apple. 
      "Conquering religions," he continued, "often adopt existing holidays to make conversion less shocking. 
      It's called transmutation. It helps people acclimatize to the new faith. Worshipers keep the same holy 
      dates, pray in the same sacred locations, use a similar symbology... and they simply substitute a 
      different god."  
      Now the girl in front looked furious. "You're implying Christianity is just some kind of... repackaged 
      sun worship!"  
      "Not at all. Christianity did not borrow only from sun worship. The ritual of Christian canonization is 
      taken from the ancient 'god-making' rite of Euhemerus. The practice of 'god-eating'-that is, Holy 
      Communion was borrowed from the Aztecs. Even the concept of Christ dying for our sins is arguably 
      not exclusively Christian; the self -sacrifice of a young man to absolve the sins of his people appears in 
      the earliest tradition of the Quetzalcoatl."  
      The girl glared. "So, is anything in Christianity original?" 
      "Very little in any organized faith is truly original. Religions are not born from scratch. They grow from 
      one another. Modern religion is a collage... an assimilated historical record of man's quest to  
      understand the divine." 
      "Um... hold o n," Hitzrot ventured, sounding awake now. "I know something Christian that's original. 
      How about our image of God? Christian art never portrays God as the hawk sun god, or as an Aztec, 
      or as anything weird. It always shows God as an old man with a white beard. So our image of God is 
      original, right?" 
      Langdon smiled. "When the early Christian converts abandoned their former deities-pagan gods, 
      Roman gods, Greek, sun, Mithraic, whatever-they asked the church what their new Christian God 
      looked like. Wisely, t he church chose the most feared, powerful... and familiar face in all of recorded 
      history." 
      Hitzrot looked skeptical. "An old man with a white, flowing beard?" 
      Langdon pointed to a hierarchy of ancient gods on the wall. At the top sat an old man with a white, 
      flowing beard. "Does Zeus look familiar?" 
      The class ended right on cue. 
      "Good evening," a man's voice said. 
      Langdon jumped. He was back in the Pantheon. He turned to face an elderly man in a blue cape with a 
      red cross on the chest. The man gave him a gray-toothed smile.  
      "You're English, right?" The man's accent was thick Tuscan. 
      Langdon blinked, confused. "Actually, no. I'm American." 
      The man looked embarrassed. "Oh heavens, forgive me. You were so nicely dressed, I just figured... 
      my apologies."  
                         Angels & Demons      127  
                           62 
        
       
      Langdon's progress around his side of the Pantheon was being hampered somewhat by the guide on 
      his heels, now continuing his tireless narration as Langdon prepared to check the final alcove. 
      "You certainly seem to be enjoying those niches!" the docent said, looking delighted. "Were you aware 
      that the tapering thickness of the walls is the reason the dome appears weightless?" 
      Langdon nodded, not hearing a word as he prepared to examine another niche. Suddenly someone 
      grabbed him from behind. It was Vittoria. She was breathless and tugging at his arm. From the look of 
      terror on her face, Langdon could only imagine one thing. She found a body. He felt an upswelling of 
      dread. "Ah, your wife!" the docent exclaimed, clearly thrilled to have another guest. 
      He motioned to her short pants and hiking boots. "Now you I can tell are American!" 
      Vittoria's eyes narrowed. "I'm Italian."  
      The guide's smile dimmed. "Oh, dear." 
      "Robert," Vittoria whispered, trying to turn her back on the guide. "Galileo's Diagramma. I need to see 
      it." 
      "Diagramma?" the docent said, wheedling back in. "My! You two certainly know your history! 
      Unfortunately that document is not viewable. It is under secret preservation in the Vatican Arc-" 
      "Could you excuse us?" Langdon said. He was confused by Vittoria's panic. He took her aside and 
      reached in his pocket, carefully extracting the Diagramma folio. "What's going on?" 
      "What's the date on this thing?" Vittoria demanded, scanning the sheet. The docent was on them again, 
      staring at the folio, mouth agape. "That's not... really..." 
      "Tourist reproduction," Langd on quipped. "Thank you for your help. Please, my wife and I would like 
      a moment alone." 
      The docent backed off, eyes never leaving the paper. 
      "Date," Vittoria repeated to Langdon. "When did Galileo publish..." 
      Langdon pointed to the Roman numeral in the lower liner. "That's the pub date. What's going on?" 
      Vittoria deciphered the number. "1639?" 
      "Yes. What's wrong?" 
      Vittoria's eyes filled with foreboding. "We're in trouble, Robert. Big trouble. The dates don't match." 
      "What dates don't match?" 
      "Raphael's tomb . He wasn't buried here until 1759. A century after Diagramma was published." 
      Langdon stared at her, trying to make sense of the words. "No," he replied. 
      "Raphael died in 1520, long before Diagramma." 
      "Yes, but he wasn't buried here until much later." 
      Langdon was lost. "What are you talking about?" 
      "I just read it. Raphael's body was relocated to the Pantheon in 1758. It was part of some historic 
      tribute to eminent Italians."  
      As the words settled in, Langdon felt like a rug had just been yanked out from under him. 
      "When that poem was written," Vittoria declared, "Raphael's tomb was somewhere else. Back then, the 
      Pantheon had nothing at all to do with Raphael!" 
      Langdon could not breathe. "But that... means..." 
      "Yes! It means we're in the wrong place!" 
      Langdon felt himself sway. Impossible... I was certain... 
      Vittoria ran over and grabbed the docent, pulling him back. "Signore, excuse us. Where was Raphael's 
      body in the 1600s?" 
      "Urb... Urbino," he stammered, now looking bewildered. "His birthplace." 
      "Impossible!" Langdon cursed to himself. "The Illuminati altars of science were here in Rome. I'm 
      certain of it!"  
      "Illuminati?" The docent gasped, looking again at the document in Langdon's hand. "Who are you 
      people?"  
                         Angels & Demons      129  
      Now the docent cocked his head, stepping toward them again. "A demon's hole?" He muttered to 
      himself and picked at his teeth. "Demon's hole... that is... buco di��volo?" 
      Vittoria nodded. "Literally, yes." 
      The docent smiled faintly. "Now there's a term I have not heard in a while. If I'm not mistaken, a buco 
      di��volo refers to an undercroft." 
      "An undercroft?" Langdon asked. "As in a crypt?" 
      "Yes, but a specific kind of crypt. I believe a demon's hole is an ancient term for a massive burial cavity 
      located in a chapel... underneath another tomb." 
      "An ossuary annex?" Langdon demanded, immediately recognizing what the man was describing. 
      The docent looked impressed. "Yes! That is the term I was looking for!" 
      Langdon considered it. Os suary annexes were a cheap ecclesiastic fix to an awkward dilemma. When 
      churches honored their most distinguished members with ornate tombs inside the sanctuary, surviving 
      family members often demanded the family be buried together... thus ensuring they too would have a  
      coveted burial spot inside the church. However, if the church did not have space or funds to create 
      tombs for an entire family, they sometimes dug an ossuary annex-a hole in the floor near the tomb 
      where they buried the less worthy family members. The hole was then covered with the Renaissance 
      equivalent of a manhole cover. Although convenient, the ossuary annex went out of style quickly 
      because of the stench that often wafted up into the cathedral. Demon's hole, Langdon thought. He had 
      never  heard the term. It seemed eerily fitting. Langdon's heart was now pounding fiercely. From Santi's 
      earthly tomb with demon's hole. There seemed to be only one question left to ask.  
      "Did Raphael design any tombs that had one of these demon's holes?" 
      The docent scratched his head. "Actually. I'm sorry... I can only think of one." 
      Only one? Langdon could not have dreamed of a better response. 
      "Where!" Vittoria almost shouted.  
      The docent eyed them strangely. "It's called the Chigi Chapel. Tomb of Agostino Chigi and his 
      brother, wealthy patrons of the arts and sciences." 
      "Sciences?" Langdon said, exchanging looks with Vittoria.  
      "Where?" Vittoria asked again.  
      The docent ignored the question, seeming enthusiastic again to be of service. 
      "As for whether or not the tomb is earthly, I don't know, but certainly it is... shall we say differ��nte." 
      "Different?" Langdon said. "How?" 
      "Incoherent with the architecture. Raphael was only the architect. Some other sculptor did the interior 
      adornments. I can't remember who." 
      Langdon was now all ears. The anonymous Illuminati master, perhaps?  
      "Whoever did the interior monuments lacked taste," the docent said. "Dio mio! Atrocit��s! Who would 
      want to be buried beneath pir��mides?" 
      Langdon could scarcely believe his ears. "Pyramids? The chapel contains pyramids?" 
      "I know," the docent scoffed. "Terrible, isn't it?" 
      Vittoria grabbed the docent's arm. "Signore, where is this Chigi Chapel?" 
      "About a mile north. In the church of Santa Maria del Popolo." 
      Vittoria exhaled. "Thank you. Let's-" 
      "Hey," the docent said, "I just thought of something. What a fool I am." 
      Vittoria stopped short. "Please don't tell me you made a mistake." 
      He shook his head. "No, but it should have dawned on me earlier. The Chigi Chapel was not always 
      known as the Chig i. It used to be called Capella della Terra." 
      "Chapel of the Land?" Langdon asked. 
      "No," Vittoria said, heading for the door. "Chapel of the Earth." 
      Vittoria Vetra whipped out her cell phone as she dashed into Piazza della Rotunda. "Commander 
      Olivetti," she said. "This is the wrong place!" 
      Olivetti sounded bewildered. "Wrong? What do you mean?" 
      "The first altar of science is at the Chigi Chapel!" 
      "Where?" Now Olivetti sounded angry. "But Mr. Langdon said-" 
      "Santa Maria del Popolo! One mile north. Get your men over there now! We've got four minutes!" 
                         Angels & Demons      131

      Gunther Glick had assumed control of the computer from Chinita Macri, who now stood hunched in 
      the back of the cramped BBC van staring in confusion over Glick's shoulder.  
      "I told you," Glick said, typing some more keys. "The British Tattler isn't the only paper that runs 
      stories on these guys." 
      Macri peered closer. Glick was right. The BBC database showed their distinguished network as having 
      picked up and run six stories in the past ten years on the brotherhood called the Illuminati. Well, paint 
      me purple, she thought.  
      "Who are the journalists who ran the stories," Macri asked. "Schlock jocks?" 
      "BBC doesn't hire schlock jocks."  
      "They hired you." 
      Glick scowled. "I don't know why you're such a skeptic. The Illuminati are well documented 
      throughout history." 
      "So are witches, UFOs, and the Loch Ness Monster." 
      Glick read the list of stories. "You ever heard of a guy called Winston Churchill?" 
      "Rings a bell." 
      "BBC did a historical a while back on Churchill's life. Staunch Catholic by the way. Did you know that 
      in 1920 Churchill published a statement condemning the Illuminati and warning Brits of a worldwide 
      conspiracy against morality?" 
      Macri was dubious. "Where did it run? In the British Tattler?" 
      Glick smiled. "London Herald. February 8, 1920." 
      "No way."  
      "Feast your eyes." 
      Macri looked closer at the clip. London Herald. Feb. 8, 1920. I had no idea. 
      "Well, Churchill was a paranoid." 
      "He wasn't alone," Glick said, reading further. "Looks like Woodrow Wilson gave three radio 
      broadcasts in 1921 warning of growing Illuminati control over the U.S. banking system. You 
      want a direct quote from the radio transcript?" 
      "Not really."  
      Glick gave her one anyway. "He said, 'There is a power so organized, so subtle, so complete, so 
      pervasive, that none had better speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.' " 
      "I've never heard anything about this." 
      "Maybe because in 1921 you were just a kid."  
      "Charming." Macri took the jab in stride. She knew her years were showing. At forty-three, her bushy 
      black curls were streaked with gray. She was too proud for dye. Her mom, a Southern Baptist, had 
      taught Chinita contentedness and self-respect. When you're a black woman, her mother said, ain't no 
      hiding what you are. Day you try, is the day you die. Stand tall, smile bright, and let 'em wonder what 
      secret's making you laugh. 
      "Ever heard of Cecil Rhodes?" Glick asked. 
      Macri looked up. "The British financier?" 
      "Yeah. Founded the Rhodes Scholarships." 
      "Don't tell me-" 
      "Illuminatus." 
      "BS." 
      "BBC, actually. November 16, 1984." 
      "We wrote that Cecil Rhodes was Illuminati?"  
      "Sure did. And according to our network, the Rhodes Scholarships were funds set up centuries ago to  
      recruit the world's brightest young minds into the Illuminati." 
      "That's ridiculous! My uncle was a Rhodes Scholar!" 
      Glick winked. "So was Bill Clinton."

      Langdon and Vittoria's taxi completed the one-mile sprint up the wide Via della Scrofa in just over a 
      minute. They skidded to a stop on the south side of the Piazza del Popolo just before eight. Not 
      having any lire, Langdon overpaid the driver in U.S. dollars. He and Vittoria jumped out. 
      The piazza was quiet except for the laughter of a handful of locals seated outside the popular Rosati 
      Caf��-a hot spot  of the Italian literati. The breeze smelled of espresso and pastry. Langdon was still in 
      shock over his mistake at the Pantheon. With a cursory glance at this square, however, his sixth sense 
      was already tingling. The piazza seemed subtly filled with Illuminati significance. Not only was it laid 
      out in a perfectly elliptical shape, but dead center stood a towering Egyptian obelisk-a square pillar of 
      stone with a distinctively pyramidal tip. Spoils of Rome's imperial plundering, obelisks were scattered 
      across Rome and referred to by symbologists as "Lofty Pyramids"-skyward extensions of the sacred 
      pyramidal form.   
      As Langdon's eyes moved up the monolith, though, his sight was suddenly drawn to something else in 
      the background. Something even more remarkable. 
      "We're in the right place," he said quietly, feeling a sudden exposed wariness. 
      "Have a look at that." 
      Langdon pointed to the imposing Porta del Popolo-the high stone archway at the far end of the piazza. 
      The vaulted structure had been overlooking the piazza for centuries. Dead center of the archway's 
      highest point was a symbolic engraving. "Look familiar?" 
      Vittoria looked up at the huge carving. "A shining star over a triangular pile of stones?" 
      Langdon shook his head. "A source of Illumination over a pyramid." 
      Vittoria turned, her eyes suddenly wide. "Like... the Great Seal of the United States?" 
      "Exactly. The Masonic symbol on the one-dollar bill." 
      Vittoria took a deep breath and scanned the piazza. "So where's this damn church?" 
      The Church of Santa Maria del Popolo stood out like a misplaced battleship, askew at the base of a hill 
      on the southeast corner of the piazza. The eleventh-century stone aerie was made even more clumsy by 
      the tower of scaffolding covering the fa��ade. 
      Langdon's thoughts were a blur as they raced toward the edifice. He stared up at the church in wonder. 
      Could a murder really be about to take place inside? He wished Olivetti would hurry. The gun felt 
      awkward in his pocket. 
      The church's front stairs were ventaglio-a welcoming, curved fan-ironic in this case because they were 
      blocked with scaffolding, construction equipment, and a sign warning: CONSTRUZZIONE. NON 
      ENTRARE.  
      Langdon realized that a church closed for renovation meant total privacy for a killer. Not like the 
      Pantheon.  
      No fancy tricks needed here. Only to find a way in. 
      Vittoria slipped without hesitation between the sawhorses and headed up the staircase. 
      "Vittoria," Langdon cautioned. "If he's still in there..." 
      Vittoria did not seem to hear. She ascended the main portico to the church's sole wooden door. 
      Langdon hurried up the stairs behind her. Before he could say a word she had grasped the handle and 
      pulled. 
      Langdon held his breath. The door did not budge.  
      "There must be another entrance," Vittoria said. 
      "Probably," Langdon said, exhaling, "but Olivetti will be here in a minute. It's too dangerous to go in. 
      We should cover the church from out here until-" 
      Vittoria turned, her eyes blazing. "If there's another way in, there's another way out. If this guy 
      disappears, we're fungito." 
      Langdon knew enough Italian to know she was right. 
      The alley on the right side of the church was pinched and dark, with high walls on both sides. It 
      smelled of urine -a common aroma in a city where bars outnumbered public rest rooms twenty to one. 
                         Angels & Demons      135  
      "Relax, professor," she said. "I'm just getting the gun." 
      At that moment, inside the Vatican Museums, a task force of Swiss Guards spread out in all directions. 
      The museum was dark, and the guards wore U.S. Marine issue infrared goggles. The goggles made 
      everything appear an eerie shade of green. Every guard wore headphones connected to an antennalike 
      detector that he waved rhythmically in front of him-the same devices they used twice a week to 
      sweep fo r electronic bugs inside the Vatican. They moved methodically, checking behind statues, inside 
      niches, closets, under furniture. The antennae would sound if they detected even the tiniest magnetic 
      field. Tonight, however, they were getting no readings at all. 
                         Angels & Demons      137  
      "Son of a..." Langdon gasped, his heart racing. 
      Vittoria lowered the gun, quickly regaining her composure. Langdon peered around the side of the 
      column to see a workman's lunchbox splayed on the floor, apparently knocked off a sawhorse by the 
      resourceful rodent. 
      Langdon scanned the basilica for movement and whispered, "If this guy's here, he sure as hell heard 
      that. You sure you don't want to wait for Olivetti?" 
      "Secondary left apse," Vittoria repeated. "Where is it?" 
      Reluctantly Langdon turned and tried to get his bearings. Cathedral terminology was like stage 
      directionstotally counterintuitive. He faced the main altar. Stage center. Then he pointed with his 
      thumb backward over his shoulder. 
      They both turned and looked where he was pointing. 
      It seemed the Chigi Chapel was located in the third of four recessed alcoves to their right. The good 
      news was that Langdon and Vittoria were on the correct side of the church. The bad news was that 
      they we re at the wrong end. They would have to traverse the length of the cathedral, passing three 
      other chapels, each of them, like the Chigi Chapel, covered with translucent plastic shrouds. 
      "Wait," Langdon said. "I'll go first." 
      "Forget it." 
      "I'm the one who screwed up at the Pantheon." 
      She turned. "But I'm the one with the gun." 
      In her eyes Langdon could see what she was really thinking... I'm the one who lost my father. I'm the 
      one who helped build a weapon of mass destruction. This guy's kneecaps are mine... 
      Langdon sensed the futility and let her go. He moved beside her, cautiously, down the east side of the 
      basilica. As they passed the first shrouded alcove, Langdon felt taut, like a contestant on some surreal 
      game show. I'll take curtain number three, he thought. 
      The church was quiet, the thick stone walls blocking out all hints of the outside world. As they hurried 
      past one chapel after the other, pale humanoid forms wavered like ghosts behind the rustling plastic. 
      Carved marble, Langdon told himself, hoping he was right. It was 8:06 P.M. Had the killer been 
      punctual and slipped out before Langdon and Vittoria had entered? Or was he still here? 
      Langdon was unsure which scenario he preferred. 
      They passed the second apse, ominous in the slowly darkening cathedral. Night seemed to be falling 
      quickly now, accentuated by the musty tint of the stained-glass windows. As they pressed on, the 
      plastic curtain beside them billowed suddenly, as if caught in a draft. Langdon wondered if someone 
      somewhere had opened a door. 
      Vittoria slowed as the third niche loomed before them. She held the gun before her, motioning with 
      her head to the stele beside the apse. Carved in the granite block were two words: 
      CAPELLA CHIGI 
      Langdon nodded. Without a sound they moved to the corner of the opening, positioning themselves 
      behind a wide pillar. Vittoria leveled the gun around a corner at the plastic. Then she signaled for 
      Langdon to pull back the shroud. 
      A good time to start praying, he thought. Reluctantly, he reached over her shoulder. As carefully as  
      possible, he began to pull the plastic aside. It moved an inch and then crinkled loudly. They both froze. 
      Silence. After a moment, moving in slow motion, Vittoria leaned forward and peered through the 
      narrow slit. Langdon looked over her shoulder. 
      For a moment, neither one of them breathed. 
      "Empty," Vittoria finally said, lowering the gun. "We're too late." 
      Langdon did not hear. He was in awe, transported for an instant to another world. In his life, he had 
      never imagined a chapel that looked like this. Finished entirely in chestnut marble, the Chigi Chapel 
      was breathtaking. Langdon's trained eye devoured it in gulps. It was as earthly a chapel as Langdon 
      could fathom, almost as if Galileo and the Illuminati had designed it themselves. Overhead, the domed 
      cupola shone with a field of illuminated stars and the seven astronomical planets. Below that the twelve 
      signs of the zodiac -pagan, earthly symbols rooted in astronomy. The zodiac was also tied directly to 
      Earth, Air, Fire, Water... the qua drants representing power, intellect, ardor, emotion. Earth is for 
      power, Langdon recalled. Farther down the wall, Langdon saw tributes to the Earth's four temporal 
                         Angels & Demons      139  
      Langdon grabbed his neck. "What the hell are you doing?" 
      "I was giving you some light," she said. "You backed right into me." 
      Langdon glared at the portable blowtorch in her hand. 
      "Best I could do," she said. "No flashlights." 
      Langdon rubbed his neck. "I didn't hear you come in." 
      Vittoria handed him the torch, wincing again at the stench of the crypt. "You think those fumes are 
      combustible?"  
      "Let's hope no t." 
      He took the torch and moved slowly toward the hole. Cautiously, he advanced to the rim and pointed 
      the flame down into the hole, lighting the side wall. As he directed the light, his eyes traced the outline 
      of the wall downward. The crypt was circular and about twenty feet across. Thirty feet down, the glow 
      found the floor. The ground was dark and mottled. Earthy. Then Langdon saw the body. 
      His instinct was to recoil. "He's here," Langdon said, forcing himself not to turn away. The figure was a 
      pallid outline against the earthen floor. "I think he's been stripped naked." 
      Langdon flashed on the nude corpse of Leonardo Vetra. 
      "Is it one of the cardinals?" 
      Langdon had no idea, but he couldn't imagine who the hell else it would be. He stared down at the pale 
      blob. Unmoving. Lifeless. And yet... Langdon hesitated. There was something very strange about the 
      way the figure was positioned. He seemed to be... 
      Langdon called out. "Hello?" 
      "You think he's alive?"  
      There was no response from below. 
      "He's not moving," Langdon said. "But he looks..." No, impossible. 
      "He looks what?" Vittoria was peering over the edge now too. 
      Langdon squinted into the darkness. "He looks like he's standing up." 
      Vittoria held her breath and lowered her face over the edge for a better look. 
      After a moment, she pulled back. "You're right. He's standing up! Maybe he's alive and needs help!" 
      She called into the hole. "Hello?! Mi pu�� sentire?" 
      There was no echo off the mossy interior. Only silence. 
      Vittoria headed for the rickety ladder. "I'm going down."  
      Langdon caught her arm. "No. It's dangerous. I'll go." 
      This time Vittoria didn't argue.

                           67 
       
       
      The descent was slow. 
      Langdon dropped rung by rung down the creaking ladder... deeper and deeper beneath the floor of the 
      Chigi Chapel. Into the Demon's hole, he thought. He was facing the side wall, his back to the chamber, 
      and he wondered how many more dark, cramped spaces one day could provide. The ladder groaned 
      with every step, and the pungent smell of rotting flesh and dampness was almost asphyxiating. 
      Langdon wondered where the hell Olivetti was. 
      Vittoria's outline was still visible above, holding the blowtorch inside the hole, lighting Langdon's way. 
      As he lowered himself deeper into the darkness, the bluish glow from above got fainter. The only thing 
      that got stronger was the stench. 
      Twelve rungs down, it happened. Langdon's foot hit a spot that was slippery with decay, and he 
      faltered. Lunging forward, he caught the ladder with his forearms to avoid plummeting to the bottom. 
      Cursing the bruises now throbbing on his arms, he dragged his body back onto the ladder and began 
      his descent again. Three rungs deeper, he almost fell again, but this time it was not a rung that caused 
      the mishap. It was a bolt of fear. He had descended past a hollowed niche in the wall before him and 
      suddenly fo und himself face to face with a collection of skulls. As he caught his breath and looked 
      around him, he realized the wall at this level was honeycombed with shelflike openings-burial niches-all 
      filled with skeletons. In the phosphorescent light, it made for an eerie collage of empty sockets and 
      decaying rib cages flickering around him. 
      Skeletons by firelight, he grimaced wryly, realizing he had quite coincidentally endured a similar evening 
      just last month. An evening of bones and flames. The New York Museum of Archeology's candlelight  
      benefit dinner-salmon flamb�� in the shadow of a brontosaurus skeleton. He had attended at the 
      invitation of Rebecca Strauss -one-time fashion model now art critic from the Times, a whirlwind of 
      black velvet, cigarettes, and not-so-subtly enhanced breasts. She'd called him twice since. Langdon had 
      not returned her calls. Most ungentlemanly, he chided, wondering how long Rebecca Strauss would last 
      in a stink-pit like this. 
      Langdon was relieved to feel the final rung give way to the spongy earth at the bottom. The ground 
      beneath his shoes felt damp. Assuring himself the walls were not going to close in on him, he turned 
      into the crypt. It was circular, about twenty feet across. Breathing through his sleeve again, Langdon 
      turned his eyes to the body. In the gloom, the image was hazy. A white, fleshy outline. Facing the other 
      direction. Motionless. Silent.  
      Advancing through the murkiness of the crypt, Langdon tried to make sense of what he was looking at. 
      The man had his back to Langdon, and Langdon could not see his face, but he did indeed seem to be 
      standing.  
      "Hello?" Langdon choked through his sleeve. Nothing. As he drew nearer, he realized the man was 
      very short. Too short... 
      "What's happening?" Vittoria called from above, shifting the light. 
      Langdon did not answer. He was now close enough to see it all. With a tremor of repulsion, he 
      understood.  
      The chamber seemed to contract around him. Emerging like a demon from the earthen floor was an 
      old man... or at least half of him. He was buried up to his waist in the earth. Standing upright with half 
      of him below ground. Stripped naked. His hands tied behind his back with a red cardinal's sash. He 
      was propped limply upward, spine arched backward like some sort of hideous punching bag. The 
      man's head lay backward, eyes toward the heavens as if pleading for help from God himself. 
      "Is he dead?" Vittoria called.  
      Langdon moved toward the body. I hope so, for his sake. As he drew to within a few feet, he looked 
      down at the upturned eyes. They bulged outward, blue and bloodshot. Langdon leaned down to listen 
      for breath but immediately recoiled. "For Christ's sake!" 
      "What!"

      Despite the soft glow of candlelight in the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Mortati was on edge. Conclave had 
      officially begun. And it had begun in a most inauspicious fashion. Half an hour ago, at the appointed 
      hour, Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca had entered the chapel. He walked to the front altar and gave 
      opening prayer. Then, he unfolded his hands and spoke to them in a tone as direct as anything Mortati 
      had ever heard from the altar of the Sistine.  
      "You are well aware," the camerlegno said, "that our four preferiti are not present in conclave at this  
      moment. I ask, in the name of his late Holiness, that you proceed as you must... with faith and purpose. 
      May you have only God before your eyes." Then he turned to go. 
      "But," one cardinal blurted out, "where are they?" 
      The camerlegn o paused. "That I cannot honestly say." 
      "When will they return?" 
      "That I cannot honestly say." 
      "Are they okay?"  
      "That I cannot honestly say." 
      "Will they return?" 
      There was a long pause. 
      "Have faith," the camerlegno said. Then he walked out of the room. 
      The doors to the Sistine Chapel had been sealed, as was the custom, with two heavy chains on the 
      outside. Four Swiss Guards stood watch in the hallway beyond. Mortati knew the only way the doors 
      could be opened now, prior to electing a Pope, was if someone inside fell deathly ill, or if the preferiti 
      arrived. Mortati prayed it would be the latter, although from the knot in his stomach he was not so 
      sure. 
      Proceed as we must, Mortati decided, taking his lead from the resolve in the camerlegno's voice. So he 
      had called for a vote. What else could he do? It had taken thirty minutes to complete the preparatory 
      rituals leading up to this first vote. Mortati had waited patiently at the main altar as each cardinal, in 
      order of seniority, had approached and performed the specific balloting procedure. Now, at last, the 
      final cardinal had arrived at the altar and was kneeling before him. 
      "I call as my witness," the cardinal declared, exactly as those before him, "Christ the Lord, who will be 
      my judge that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected." 
      The cardinal stood up. He held his ballot high over his head for everyone to see. Then he lowered the 
      ballot to the altar, where a plate sat atop a large chalice. He placed the ballot on the plate. Next he 
      picked up the plate and used it to drop the ballot into the chalice. Use of the plate was to ensure no 
      one secretly dropped multiple ballots. 
      After he had submitted his ballot, he replaced the plate over the chalice, bowed to the cross, and 
      returned to his seat. 
      The final ballot had been cast. 
      Now it was time for Mortati to go to work. 
      Leaving the plate on top of the chalice, Mortati shook the ballots to mix them. Then he removed the 
      plate and extracted a ballot at random. He unfolded it. The ballot was exactly two inches wide. He read 
      aloud for everyone to hear. 
      "Eligo in summum pontificem..." he declared, reading the text that was embossed at the top of every 
      ballot. I elect as Supreme Pontiff... Then he announced the nominee's name that had been written 
      beneath it. After he read the name, he raised a threaded needle and pierced the ballot through the word 
      Eligo, carefully sliding the ballot onto the thread. Then he made note of the vote in a logbook. 
      Next, he repeated the entire procedure. He chose a ballot from the chalice, read it aloud, threaded it 
      onto the line, and made note in his log. Almost immediately, Mortati sensed this first vote would be 
      failed. No consensus. After only seven ballots, already seven different cardinals had been named. As 
      was normal, the handwriting on each ballot was disguised by block printing or flamboyant script. The 
      concealment was ironic in this case because the cardinals were obviously submitting votes for 
                         Angels & Demons      145  
                           69 
        
       
      Nearly asphyxiated by fumes, Langdon struggled up the ladder toward the light at the top of the pit. 
      Above him he heard voices, but nothing was making sense. His head was spinning with images of the  
      branded cardinal. Earth... Earth... 
      As he pushed upward, his vision narrowed and he feared consciousness would slip away. Two rungs 
      from the top, his balance faltered. He lunged upward trying to find the lip, but it was too far. He lost 
      his grip on the ladder and almost tumbled backward into the dark. There was a sharp pain under his 
      arms, and suddenly Langdon was airborne, legs swinging wildly out over the chasm. 
      The strong hands of two Swiss Guards hooked him under the armpits and dragged him skyward. A 
      moment later Langdon's head emerged from the Demon's hole, choking and gasping for air. The 
      guards dragged him over the lip of the opening, across the floor, and lay him down, back against the 
      cold marble floor. 
      For a moment, Langdon was unsure where he was. Overhead he saw stars... orbiting planets. Hazy 
      figures raced past him. People were shouting. He tried to sit up. He was lying at the base of a stone 
      pyramid. The familiar bite of an angry tongue echoed inside the chapel, and then Langdon knew. 
      Olivetti was screaming at Vittoria. "Why the hell didn't you figure that out in the first place!" 
      Vittoria was trying to explain the situation. Olivetti cut her off midsentence and turned to bark orders 
      to his men. "Get that body out of there! Search the rest of the building!"  
      Langdon tried to sit up. The Chigi Chapel was packed with Swiss Guards. The plastic curtain over the 
      chapel opening had been torn off the entryway, and fresh air filled Langdon's lungs. As his senses 
      slowly returned, Langdon saw Vittoria coming toward him. She knelt down, her face like an angel. 
      "You okay?" Vittoria took his arm and felt his pulse. Her hands were tender on his skin. 
      "Thanks." Langdon sat up fully. "Olivetti's mad." 
      Vittoria nodded. "He has a right to be. We blew it." 
      "You mean I blew it." 
      "So redeem yourself. Get him next time." 
      Next time? Langdon thought it was a cruel comment. There is no next time! We missed our shot! 
      Vittoria checked Langdon's watch. "Mickey says we've got forty minutes. Get your head together and 
      help me find the next marker." 
      "I told you, Vittoria, the sculptures are gone. The Path of Illumination is-" 
      Langdon halted.  
      Vittoria smiled softly. 
      Suddenly Langdon was staggering to his feet. He turned dizzying circles, staring at the artwork around 
      him. Pyramids, stars, planets, ellipses. Suddenly everything came back. This is the first altar of science! 
      Not the Pantheon! It dawned on him now how perfectly Illuminati the chapel was, far more subtle and 
      selective than the world famous Pantheon. The Chigi was an out of the way alcove, a literal hole-in-
      the-wall, a tribute to a great patron of science, decorated with earthly symbology. Perfect. 
      Langdon steadied himself against the wall and gazed up at the enormous pyramid sculptures. Vittoria 
      was dead right.  If this chapel was the first altar of science, it might still contain the Illuminati sculpture 
      that served as the first marker. Langdon felt an electrifying rush of hope to realize there was still a 
      chance. If the marker were indeed here, and they could follow it to the next altar of science, they might 
      have another chance to catch the killer. 
      Vittoria moved closer. "I found out who the unknown Illuminati sculptor was." 
      Langdon's head whipped around. "You what?" 
      "Now we just need to figure out which sculpture in here is the -" 
      "Wait a minute! You know who the Illuminati sculptor was?" He had spent years trying to find that 
      information.  
      Vittoria smiled. "It was Bernini." She paused. "The Bernini." 
      Langdon immediately knew she was mistaken. Bernini was an impossibility. Gianlorenzo Bernini was 
      the second most famous sculptor of all time, his fame eclipsed only by Michelangelo himself. During 
                         Angels & Demons      147  
      Then som eone moved and he caught a glimpse. White marble. An arm. A torso. And then a sculpted 
      face.  
      Partially hidden in its niche. 
      Two life-size human figures intertwined. Langdon's pulse accelerated. He had been so taken with the 
      pyramids and demon's hole, he had not even seen this sculpture. He moved across the room, through 
      the crowd. As he drew near, Langdon recognized the work was pure Bernini-the intensity of the artistic 
      composition, the intricate faces and flowing clothing, all from the purest white marble Vatican money  
      could buy. It was not until he was almost directly in front of it that Langdon recognized the sculpture 
      itself. He stared up at the two faces and gasped. 
      "Who are they?" Vittoria urged, arriving behind him.  
      Langdon stood astonished. "Habakkuk and the Angel," he said, his voice almost inaudible. The piece 
      was a fairly well -known Bernini work that was included in some art history texts. Langdon had 
      forgotten it was here. 
      "Habakkuk?"  
      "Yes. The prophet who predicted the annihilation of the earth." 
      Vittoria looked uneasy. "You think this is the marker?" 
      Langdon nodded in amazement. Never in his life had he been so sure of anything. This was the first 
      Illuminati marker. No doubt. Although Langdon had fully expected the sculpture to somehow "point" 
      to the next altar of science, he did not expect it to be literal. Both the angel and Habakkuk had their 
      arms outstretched and were pointing into the distance. Langdon found himself suddenly smiling.  
      "Not too subtle, is it?"  
      Vittoria looked excited but conf used. "I see them pointing, but they are contradicting each other. The 
      angel is pointing one way, and the prophet the other." 
      Langdon chuckled. It was true. Although both figures were pointing into the distance, they were 
      pointing in totally opposite directions. Langdon, however, had already solved that problem. With a 
      burst of energy he headed for the door. 
      "Where are you going?" Vittoria called. 
      "Outside the building!" Langdon's legs felt light again as he ran toward the door. "I need to see what 
      direction that sculpture is pointing!" 
      "Wait! How do you know which finger to follow?" 
      "The poem," he called over his shoulder. "The last line!" 
      " 'Let angels guide you on your lofty quest?' " She gazed upward at the outstretched finger of the angel. 
      Her eyes mist ed unexpectedly. "Well I'll be damned!" 
                         Angels & Demons      149  
      "Southwest," Langdon said, panting. "The next church is southwest of here." 
      Olivetti's whisper was cold. "You sure this time?" 
      Langdon didn't bite. "We need a map. One that shows all the churches in Rome." 
      The commander studied him a moment, his expression never changing. 
      Langdon checked his watch. "We only have half an hour." 
      Olivetti moved past Langdon down the stairs toward his car, parked directly in front of the cathedral. 
      Langdon hoped he was going for a map. Vittoria looked excited. "So the angel's pointing southwest? 
      No idea which churches are southwest?" 
      "I can't see past the damn buildings." Langdon turned and faced the square again. "And I don't know 
      Rome's church es well enou -" He stopped.  
      Vittoria looked startled. "What?" 
      Langdon looked out at the piazza again. Having ascended the church stairs, he was now higher, and his 
      view was better. He still couldn't see anything, but he realized he was moving in the right direction. His 
      eyes climbed the tower of rickety scaffolding above him. It rose six stories, almost to the top of the 
      church's rose window, far higher than the other buildings in the square. He knew in an instant where 
      he was headed. 
      Across the square, Chinita Macri and Gunther Glick sat glued to the windshield of the BBC van. 
      "You getting this?" Gunther asked. 
      Macri tightened her shot on the man now climbing the scaffolding. "He's a little well dressed to be 
      playing Spiderman if you ask me." 
      "And who's Ms.  Spidey?" 
      Chinita glanced at the attractive woman beneath the scaffolding. "Bet you'd like to find out." 
      "Think I should call editorial?" 
      "Not yet. Let's watch. Better to have something in the can before we admit we abandoned conclave." 
      "You think somebody really killed one of the old farts in there?" 
      Chinita clucked. "You're definitely going to hell."  
      "And I'll be taking the Pulitzer with me." 
                         Angels & Demons      151  
                           72 
        
       
      Langdon swung off the scaffolding and dropped back to the ground. He brushed the plaster dust from  
      his clothes. Vittoria was there to greet him. 
      "No luck?" she said. 
      He shook his head. 
      "They put the cardinal in the trunk." 
      Langdon looked over to the parked car where Olivetti and a group of soldiers now had a map spread 
      out on the hood.  "Are they looking southwest?" 
      She nodded. "No churches. From here the first one you hit is St. Peter's." 
      Langdon grunted. At least they were in agreement. He moved toward Olivetti. The soldiers parted to 
      let him through. 
      Olivetti looked up. "Nothing. But  this doesn't show every last church. Just the big ones. About fifty of 
      them."   
      "Where are we?" Langdon asked. 
      Olivetti pointed to Piazza del Popolo and traced a straight line exactly southwest. The line missed, by a 
      substantial margin, the cluster of black squares indicating Rome's major churches. Unfortunately, 
      Rome's major churches were also Rome's older churches... those that would have been around in the 
      1600s.  
      "I've got some decisions to make," Olivetti said. "Are you certain of the direction?" 
      Langdon pictured the angel's outstretched finger, the urgency rising in him again. "Yes, sir. Positive." 
      Olivetti shrugged and traced the straight line again. The path intersected the Margherita Bridge, Via 
      Cola di Riezo, and passed through Piazza del Risorgimento, hitting no churches at all until it dead-
      ended abruptly at the center of St. Peter's Square. 
      "What's wrong with St. Peter's?" one of the soldiers said. He had a deep scar under his left eye. "It's a 
      church." 
      Langdon shook his head. "Needs to be a public place. Hardly seems public at the moment." 
      "But the line goes through St. Peter's Square," Vittoria added, looking over Langdon's shoulder. "The 
      square is public." 
      Langdon had already considered it. "No statues, though." 
      "Isn't there a monolith in the middle?" 
      She was right. There was an Egyptian monolith in St. Peter's Square. Langdon looked out at the 
      monolith in the piazza in front of them. The lofty pyramid. An odd coincidence, he thought. He shook 
      it off. "The Vatican's monolith is not by Bernini. It was brought in by Caligula. And it has nothing to 
      do with Air." 
      There was another problem as well. "Besides, the poem says the elements are spread across Rome. St. 
      Peter's Square is in Vatican City. Not Rome."  
      "Depends who you ask," a guard interjected. 
      Langdon looked up. "What?" 
      "Always a bone of contention. Most maps show St. Peter's Square as part of Vatican City, but because 
      it's outside the walled city, Roman officials for centuries have claimed it as part of Rome." 
      "You're kidding," Langdon said. He had never known that. 
      "I only mention it," the guard continued, "because Commander Olivetti and Ms. Vetra were asking 
      about a sculpture that had to do with Air." 
      Langdon was wide-eyed. "And you know of one in St. Peter's Square?" 
      "Not exactly. It's not really a sculpture. Probably not relevant." 
      "Let's hear it," Olivetti pressed. 
      The guard shrugged. "The only reason I know about it is because I'm usually on piazza duty. I know 
      every corner of St. Peter's Square." 
      "The sculpture," Langdon urged. "What does it look like?" Langdon was starting to wonder if the 
      Illuminati could really have been gutsy enough to position their second marker right outside St. Peter's 
                         Angels & Demons      153  
                           73 
        
       
      Gunther Glick floored the BBC van's accelerator and swerved through traffic as he tailed the four 
      speeding Alfa Romeos across the Tiber River on Ponte Margherita. Normally Glick would have made 
      an effort t o maintain an inconspicuous distance, but today he could barely keep up. 
      These guys were flying. 
      Macri sat in her work area in the back of the van finishing a phone call with London. She hung up and 
      yelled to Glick over the sound of the traffic. "You want the good news or bad news?" 
      Glick frowned. Nothing was ever simple when dealing with the home office. "Bad news." 
      "Editorial is burned we abandoned our post." 
      "Surprise." 
      "They also think your tipster is a fraud." 
      "Of course."  
      "And the boss just warned me that you're a few crumpets short of a proper tea." 
      Glick scowled. "Great. And the good news?" 
      "They agreed to look at the footage we just shot." 
      Glick felt his scowl soften into a grin. I guess we'll see who's short a few crumpets. "So fire it off." 
      "Can't transmit until we stop and get a fixed cell read." 
      Glick gunned the van onto Via Cola di Rienzo. "Can't stop now." He tailed the Alfa Romeos through a 
      hard left swerve around Piazza Risorgimento. 
      Macri held on to her computer gear in back as everything slid. "Break my transmitter," she warned, 
      "and we'll have to walk this footage to London." 
      "Sit tight, love. Something tells me we're almost there." 
      Macri looked up. "Where?" 
      Glick gazed out at the familiar dome now looming directly in front of them. He smiled. "Right back 
      where we started." 
      The four Alfa Romeos slipped deftly into traffic surrounding St. Peter's Square. They split up and 
      spread out along the piazza perimeter, quietly unloading men at select points. The debarking guards 
      moved into the throng of tourists and media vans on the edge of the square and instantly became 
      invisible. Some of the guards entered the forest of pillars encompassing the colonnade. They too 
      seemed to evaporate into the surroundings. As Langdon watched through the windshield, he sensed a 
      noose tightening around St. Peter's. 
      In addition to the men Olivetti had just dispatched, the commander had radioed ahead to the Vatican 
      and sent additional undercover guards to the center where Bernini's West Ponente was located. As 
      Langdon looked out at the wide-open spaces of St. Peter's Square, a familiar question nagged. How 
      does the Illuminati assassin plan to get away with this? How will he get a cardinal through all these 
      people and kill him in plain view? Langdon checked his Mickey Mouse watch. It was 8:54 P.M. Six 
      minutes.   
      In the front seat, Olivetti turned and faced Langdon and Vittoria. "I want you two right on top of this 
      Bernini brick or block or whatever the hell it is. Same drill. You're tourists. Use the phone if you see 
      anythi ng." 
      Before Langdon could respond, Vittoria had his hand and was pulling him out of the car. 
      The springtime sun was setting behind St. Peter's Basilica, and a massive shadow spread, engulfing the 
      piazza. Langdon felt an ominous chill as he and Vittoria moved into the cool, black umbra. Snaking 
      through the crowd, Langdon found himself searching every face they passed, wondering if the killer 
      was among them. Vittoria's hand felt warm. 
      As they crossed the open expanse of St. Peter's Square, Langdon sensed Bernini's sprawling piazza 
      having the exact effect the artist had been commissioned to create-that of "humbling all those who 
      entered."  
      Langdon certainly felt humbled at the moment. Humbled and hungry, he realized, surprised such a 
      mundane thought could enter his head at a moment like this. 
                         Angels & Demons      155  
                           74 
        
       
      Langdon saw what he was looking for a good ten yards before they reached it. Through the scattered 
      tourists, the white marble ellipse of Bernini's West Ponente stood out against the gray granite cubes 
      that made up the rest of the piazza. Vittoria apparently saw it too. Her hand tensed.  
      "Relax," Langdon whispered. "Do your piranha thing." 
      Vittoria loosened her grip. 
      As they drew nearer, everything seemed forbiddingly normal. Tourists wandered, nuns chatted along 
      the perimeter of the piazza, a girl fed pigeons at the base of the obelisk. Langdon refrained from 
      checking his watch. He knew it was almost time. The elliptical stone arrived beneath their feet, and 
      Langdon and Vittoria slowed to a stop-not overeagerly just two tourists pausing dutifully at a point of 
      mild interest. 
      "West Ponente," Vittoria said, reading the inscription on the stone. 
      Langdon gazed down at the marble relief and felt suddenly na��ve. Not in his art books, not in his 
      numerous trips to Rome, not ever had West Ponente's significance jumped out at him. Not until now. 
      The relief was elliptical, about three feet long, and carved with a rudimentary face-a depiction of the 
      West Wind as an angel-like countenance. Gusting from the angel's mouth, Bernini had drawn a 
      powerful breath of air blowing outward away from the Vatican... the breath of God. This was Bernini's 
      tribute to the second element... Air... an ethereal zephyr blown from angel's lips. As Langdon stared, he 
      realized the significance of the relief went deeper still. Bernini had carved the air in five distinct gusts... 
      five! What was more, flanking the medallion were two shining stars. Langdon thought of Galileo. Two 
      stars, five gusts, ellipses, symmetry... He felt hollow. His head hurt. 
      Vittoria began walking again almost immediately, leading Langdon away from the relief. "I think 
      someone's following us," she said. 
      Langdon looked up. "Where?" 
      Vittoria moved a good thirty yards before speaking. She pointed up at the Vatican as if showing 
      Langdon something on the dome. "The same person has been behind us all the way across the square." 
      Casually, Vittoria glanced over her shoulder. "Still on us. Keep moving." 
      "You think it's the Hassassin?" 
      Vittoria shook her head. "Not unless the Illuminati hires women with BBC cameras." 
      When the bells of St. Peter's began their deafening clamor, both Langdon and Vittoria jumped. It was 
      time. They had circled away from West Ponente in an attempt to lose the reporter but were now 
      moving back toward the relief. 
      Despite the clanging bells, the area seemed perfectly calm. Tourists wandered. A homeless drunk 
      dozed awkwardly at the base of the obelisk. A little girl fed pigeons. Langdon wondered if the reporter 
      had scared the killer off. Doubtful, he decided, recalling the killer's promise. I will make your cardinals 
      media luminaries. 
      As the echo of the ninth bell faded away, a peaceful silence descended across the square. Then... the 
      little girl began to scream.

                           76 
        
       
      Chinita Macri was on the run. She had the story of her life. Her video camera felt like an anchor as she 
      lumbered across St. Peter's Square, pushing through the gathering crowd. Everyone seemed to be 
      moving in the opposite direction than her... toward the commotion. Macri was trying to get as far away 
      as possible. The man in the tweed jacket had seen her, and now she sensed others were after her, men 
      she could not see, closing in from all sides. 
      Macri was still aghast from the images she had just recorded. She wondered if the dead man was really 
      who she feared he was. Glick's mysterious phone contact suddenly seemed a little less crazy. 
      As she hurried in the direction of the BBC van, a young man with a decidedly militaristic air emerged 
      from the crowd before her. Their eyes met, and they both stopped. Like lightning, he raised a walkie-
      talkie and spoke into it. Then he moved toward her. Macri wheeled and doubled back into the crowd, 
      her heart pounding.  
      As she stumbled through the mass of arms and legs, she removed the spent video cassette from her 
      camera. Cellulose gold, she thought, tucking the tape under her belt flush to her backside and letting 
      her coat tails cover it. For once she was glad she carried some extra weight. Glick, where the hell are 
      you!  
      Another soldier appeared to her left, closing in. Macri knew she had little time. She banked into the 
      crowd again. Yanking a blank cartridge from her case, she slapped it into the camera. Then she prayed. 
      She was thirty yards from the BBC van when the two men materialized directly in front of her, arms 
      folded. She was going nowhere.  
      "Film," one snapped. "Now." 
      Macri recoiled, wrapping her arms protectively around her camera. "No chance." 
      One of the men pulled aside his jacket, revealing a sidearm.  
      "So shoot me," Macri said, amazed by the boldness of her voice. 
      "Film," the first one repeated. 
      Where the devil is Glick? Macri stamped her foot and yelled as loudly as possible, "I am a professional 
      videographer with the BBC! By Article 12 of the Free Press Act, this film is property of the British 
      Broadcast Corporation!"  
      The men d id not flinch. The one with the gun took a step toward her. "I am a lieutenant with the Swiss 
      Guard, and by the Holy Doctrine governing the property on which you are now standing, you are 
      subject to search and seizure." 
      A crowd had started to gather now around them.  
      Macri yelled, "I will not under any circumstances give you the film in this camera without speaking to 
      my editor in London. I suggest you-" 
      The guards ended it. One yanked the camera out of her hands. The other forcibly grabbed her by the 
      arm and twisted her in the direction of the Vatican. "Grazie," he said, leading her through a jostling 
      crowd. Macri prayed they would not search her and find the tape. If she could somehow protect the 
      film long enough to - 
      Suddenly, the unthinkable happened. Someone in the crowd was groping under her coat. Macri felt the 
      video yanked away from her. She wheeled, but swallowed her words. Behind her, a breathless Gunther 
      Glick gave her a wink and dissolved back into the crowd. 
                         Angels & Demons      159

      In London, a BBC technician ejected a video cassette from a satellite receiver unit and dashed across 
      the control room floor. She burst into the office of the editor-in-chief, slammed the video into his 
      VCR, and pressed play.  
      As the tape rolled, she told him about the conversation she had just had with Gunther Glick in Vatican 
      City. In addition, BBC photo archives had just given her a positive ID on the victim in St. Peter's 
      Square. 
      When the editor -in-chief emerged from his office, he was ringing a cowbell. 
      Everything in editorial stopped. 
      "Live in five!" the man boomed. "On-air talent to prep! Media coordinators, I want your contacts on 
      line! We've got a story we're selling! And we've got film!" 
      The market coordinators grabbed their Rolodexes. 
      "Film specs!" one of them yelled. 
      "Thirty-second trim," the chief replied. 
      "Content?" 
      "Live homicide." 
      The coordinators looked encouraged. "Usage and licensing price?" 
      "A million U.S. per." 
      Heads shot up. "What!" 
      "You heard me! I want top of the food chain. CNN, MSNBC, then the big three! Offer a dial-in 
      preview. Give them five minutes to piggyback before BBC runs it." 
      "What the hell happened?" someone demanded. "The prime minister get skinned alive?" 
      The chief shook his head. "Better." 
      At that exact instant, somewhere in Rome, the Hassassin enjoyed a fleeting moment of repose in a 
      comfortable chair. He admired the legendary chamber around him. I am sitting in the Church of 
      Illumination, he thought. The Illuminati lair. He could not believe it was still here after all of these 
      centuries. Dutifully,  he dialed the BBC reporter to whom he had spoken earlier. It was time. The world 
      had yet to hear the most shocking news of all. 
                         Angels & Demons      161  
      "Not necessarily. We must remember that the cardinals spent much of today in the Vatican museums 
      and St. Peter's Bas ilica, enjoying those areas without the crowds. It is probable that the missing 
      cardinals were taken in one of these areas." 
      "But how were they removed from our walls?" 
      "We are still assessing that." 
      "I see." The camerlegno exhaled and stood up. He walked over to Olivetti. 
      "Commander, I would like to hear your contingency plan for evacuation." 
      "We are still formalizing that, signore. In the meantime, I am faithful Captain Rocher will find the 
      canister."  
      Rocher clicked his boots as if in appreciation of the vote of confidence. "My men have already scanned 
      two-thirds of the white zones. Confidence is high." 
      The camerlegno did not appear to share that confidence. 
      At that moment the guard with a scar beneath one eye came through the door carrying a clipboard and 
      a map. He strode toward Langdon. "Mr. Langdon? I have the information you requested on the West 
      Ponente."  
      Langdon swallowed his scone. "Good. Let's have a look." 
      The others kept talking while Vittoria joined Robert and the guard as they spread out the map on the 
      Pope's desk.  
      The soldier pointed to St. Peter's Square. "This is where we are. The central line of West Ponente's 
      breath points due east, directly away from Vatican City." The guard traced a line with his finger from 
      St. Peter's Square across the Tiber River and up into the heart of old Rome. "As you can see, the line 
      passes through almost all of Rome. There are about twenty Catholic churches that fall near this line." 
      Langdon slumped. "Twenty?" 
      "Maybe more." 
      "Do any of the churches fall directly on the line?" 
      "Some look closer than others," the guard said, "but translating the exact bearing of the West Ponente 
      onto a map leaves margin for error." 
      Langdon looked out at St. Peter's Square a moment. Then he scowled, stroking his chin. "How about 
      fire? Any of them have Bernini artwork that has to do with fire?" 
      Silence. 
      "How about obelisks?" he demanded. "Are any of the churches located near obelisks?" 
      The guard began checking the map. Vittoria saw a glimmer of hope in Langdon's eyes and realized 
      what he was thinking. He's right! The first two markers had been located on or near piazzas that 
      contained obelisks! Maybe obelisks were a theme? 
      Soaring pyramids marking the Illuminati path? The more Vittoria thought about it, the more perfect it 
      seemed... four towering beacons rising over Rome to mark the altars of science. 
      "It's a long shot," Langdon said, "but I know that many of Rome's obelisks were erected or moved 
      during Bernini's reign. He was no doubt involved in their placement." 
      "Or," Vittoria added, "Bernini could have placed his markers near existing obelisks." 
      Langdon nodded. "True." 
      "Bad news," the guard said. "No obelisks on the line." He traced his finger across the map. "None even 
      remotely close. Nothing." 
      Langdon sighed.  
      Vittoria's shoulders slumped. She'd thought it was a promising idea. Apparently, this was not going to 
      be as easy as they'd hoped. She tried to stay positive. "Robert, think. You must know of a Bernini 
      statue relating to fire. Anything at all." 
      "Believe me, I've been thinking. Bernini was incredibly prolific. Hundreds of works. I was hoping West 
      Ponente would point to a single church. Something that would ring a bell." 
      "Fu��co," she pressed. "Fire. No Bernini titles jump out?" 
      Langdon shrugged. "There's his famous sketches of Fireworks, but they're not sculpture, and they're in  
      Leipzig, Germany." 
      Vittoria frowned. "And you're sure the breath is what indicates the direction?" 
                         Angels & Demons      163  
                           80 
        
       
      When Langdon had left the Vatican Secret Archives only two hours ago, he had never imagined he 
      would see th em again. Now, winded from having jogged the entire way with his Swiss Guard escort, 
      Langdon found himself back at the archives once again. His escort, the guard with the scar, now led 
      Langdon through the rows of translucent cubicles. The silence of the archives felt somehow more 
      forbidding now, and Langdon was thankful when the guard broke it. 
      "Over here, I think," he said, escorting Langdon to the back of the chamber where a series of smaller 
      vaults lined the wall. The guard scanned the titles on the vaults and motioned to one of them. "Yes, 
      here it is. Right where the commander said it would be." 
      Langdon read the title. ATTIVI VATICANI. Vatican assets? He scanned the list of contents. Real 
      estate... currency... Vatican Bank... antiquities... The list went on. 
      "Paperwork of all Vatican assets," the guard said. 
      Langdon looked at the cubicle. Jesus. Even in the dark, he could tell it was packed. 
      "My commander said that whatever Bernini created while under Vatican patronage would be listed 
      here as an asset." 
      Langdon nodded, realizing the commander's instincts just might pay off. In Bernini's day, everything 
      an artist created while under the patronage of the Pope became, by law, property of the Vatican. It was 
      more like feudalism than patronage, but top artists lived well and seldom complained.  
      "Including works placed in churches outside Vatican City?" 
      The soldier gave him an odd look. "Of course. All Catholic churches in Rome are property of the 
      Vatican." 
      Langdon looked at the list in his hand. It contained the names of the twenty or so churches that were 
      located on a direct line with West Ponente's breath. The third altar of science was one of them, and 
      Langdon hoped he had time to figure out which it was. Under other circumstances, he would gladly 
      have explored each church in person. Today, however, he had about twenty minutes to find what he 
      was looking for-the one church containing a Bernini tribute to fire. Langdon walked to the vault's 
      electronic revolving door. The guard did not follow. Langdon sensed an uncertain hesitation. He 
      smiled. "The air's fine. Thin, but breathable." 
      "My orders are to escort you here and then return immediately to the security center." 
      "You're leaving?" 
      "Yes. The Swiss Guard are not allowed inside the archives. I am breaching protocol by escorting you 
      this far. The commander reminded me of that." 
      "Breaching protocol?" Do you have any idea what is going on here tonight? "Whose side is your damn 
      commander on!" 
      All friendliness disappeared from the guard's face. The scar under his eye twitched. The guard stared, 
      looking suddenly a lot like Olivetti himself.  
      "I apologize," Langdon said, regretting the comment. "It's just... I could use some help." 
      The guard did not blink. "I am trained to follow orders. Not debate them. When you find what you are 
      looking for, contact the commander immediately." 
      Langdon was flustered. "But where will he be?" 
      The guard removed his walkie -talkie and set it on a nearby table. "Channel one." 
      Then he disappeared into the dark. 
                         Angels & Demons      165  
      confirm a motive for the attack, our sources tell us that responsibility for the murders has been claimed 
      by a group calling themselves the Illuminati." 
      Olivetti exploded. "What!"  
      "... find out more about the Illuminati by visiting our website at-" 
      "Non �� posibile!" Olivetti declared. He switched channels. 
      This station had a Hispanic male reporter. "-a satanic cult known as the Illuminati, who some 
      historians believe -" 
      Olivetti began pressing the remote wildly. Every channel was in the middle of a live update. Most were 
      in English. 
      "-Swiss Guards removing a body from a church earlier this evening. The body is believed to be that of 
      Cardinal-"  
      "-lights in the basilica and museums are extinguished leaving speculation-" 
      "-will be speaking with conspiracy theorist Tyler Tingley, about this shocking resurgence-" 
      "-rumors of two more assassinations planned for later this evening-" 
      "-questioning now whether papal hopeful Cardinal Baggia is among the missing-" 
      Vittoria turned away. Everything was happening so fast. Outside the window, in the settling dark, the 
      raw magnetism of human tragedy seemed to be sucking people toward Vatican City. The crowd in the 
      square thickened almost by the instant. Pedestrians streamed toward them while a new batch of media 
      personnel unloaded vans and staked their claim in St. Peter's Square. 
      Olivetti set down the remote control and turned to the camerlegno. "Signore, I cannot imagine how 
      this could happen. We took the tape that was in that camera!"  
      The camerlegno looked momentarily too stunned to speak. Nobody said a word. The Swiss Guards 
      stood rigid at attention. 
      "It appears," the camerlegno said finally, sounding too devastated to be angry, "that we have not 
      contained this crisis as well as I was led to believe." He looked out the window at the gathering masses. 
      "I need to make an address." 
      Olivetti shook his head. "No, signore. That is exactly what the Illuminati want you to do-confirm them,  
      empower them. We must remain silent." 
      "And these people?" The camerlegno pointed out the window. "There will be tens of thousands 
      shortly. Then hundreds of thousands. Continuing this charade only puts them in danger. I need to 
      warn them. Then we need to evacuate our College of Cardinals." 
      "There is  still time. Let Captain Rocher find the antimatter." 
      The camerlegno turned. "Are you attempting to give me an order?" 
      "No, I am giving you advice. If you are concerned about the people outside, we can announce a gas 
      leak and clear the area, but admitting we are hostage is dangerous." 
      "Commander, I will only say this once. I will not use this office as a pulpit to lie to the world. If I 
      announce anything at all, it will be the truth." 
      "The truth? That Vatican City is threatened to be destroyed by satanic terrorists? It only weakens our 
      position." 
      The camerlegno glared. "How much weaker could our position be?" 
      Rocher shouted suddenly, grabbing the remote and increasing the volume on the television. Everyone 
      turned. On air, the woman from MSNBC now looked genuinely unnerved. Superimposed beside her 
      was a photo of the late Pope. "... breaking information. This just in from the BBC..." 
      She glanced off camera as if to confirm she was really supposed to make this announcement. 
      Apparently getting confirmation, she turned and grimly faced the viewers. "The Illuminati have just 
      claimed responsibility for..." She hesitated. "They have claimed responsibility for the death of the Pope 
      fifteen days ago." 
      The camerlegno's jaw fell. 
      Rocher dropped the remote control. 
      Vittoria could barely process the information. 
      "By Vatican law," the woman continued, "no formal autopsy is ever performed on a Pope, so the 
      Illuminati claim of murder cannot be confirmed. Nonetheless, the Illuminati hold that the cause of the 
      late Pope's death was not a stroke as the Vatican reported, but poisoning." 
                         Angels & Demons      167  
      Olivetti spun toward her. "Ms. Vetra, in case you didn't hear me, papal autopsies are prohibited by 
      Vatican Law. We are not about to defile His Holiness's body by cutting him open just because an 
      enemy makes a taunting claim!" 
      Vittoria felt shamed. "I was not implying..." She had not meant to seem disrespectful. "I certainly was 
      not suggesting you exhume the Pope..." She hesitated, though. Something Robert told her in the Chigi 
      passed like a ghost through her mind. He had mentioned that papal sarcophagi were above ground and 
      never cemented shut, a throwback to the days of the pharaohs when sealing and burying a casket was 
      believed to trap  the deceased's soul inside. Gravity had become the mortar of choice, with coffin lids 
      often weighing hundreds of pounds. Technically, she realized, it would be possible to- 
      "What sort of signs?" the camerlegno said suddenly. 
      Vittoria felt her heart flutter with fear. "Overdoses can cause bleeding of the oral mucosa." 
      "Oral what?" 
      "The victim's gums would bleed. Post mortem, the blood congeals and turns the inside of the mouth 
      black." Vittoria had once seen a photo taken at an aquarium in London where a pair of killer whales 
      had been mistakenly overdosed by their trainer. The whales floated lifeless in the tank, their mouths 
      hanging open and their tongues black as soot. 
      The camerlegno made no reply. He turned and stared out the window. Rocher's voice had lost its 
      optimism. "Signore, if this claim about poisoning is true..." 
      "It's not true," Olivetti declared. "Access to the Pope by an outsider is utterly impossible." 
      "If this claim is true," Rocher repeated, "and our Holy Father was poisoned, then that has profound 
      implications for our antimatter search. The alleged assassination implies a much deeper infiltration of 
      Vatican City than we had imagined. Searching the white zones may be inadequate. If we are 
      compromised to such a deep extent, we may not find the canister in time."  
      Olivetti leveled his captain with a cold stare. "Captain, I will tell you what is going to happen." 
      "No," the camerlegno said, turning suddenly. "I will tell you what is going to happen." He looked 
      directly at Olivetti. "This has gone far enough. In twenty minutes I will be making a decision whether 
      or not to cancel conclave and evacuate Vatican City. My decision will be final. Is that clear?" 
      Olivetti did not blink. Nor did he respond.  
      The camerlegno spoke forcefully now, as though tapping a hidden reserve of power. "Captain Rocher, 
      you will complete your search of the white zones and report directly to me when you are finished." 
      Rocher nodded, throwing Olivetti an uneasy glance. The camerlegno then singled out two guards. "I 
      want the BBC  reporter, Mr. Glick, in this office immediately. If the Illuminati have been  
      communicating with him, he may be able to help us. Go." 
      The two soldiers disappeared. 
      Now the camerlegno turned and addressed the remaining guards. "Gentlemen, I will not permit any 
      more loss of life this evening. By ten o'clock you will locate the remaining two cardinals and capture 
      the monster responsible for these murders. Do I make myself understood?" 
      "But, signore," Olivetti argued, "we have no idea where-" 
      "Mr. Langdon is working on that. He seems capable. I have faith." 
      With that, the camerlegno strode for the door, a new determination in his step. 
      On his way out, he pointed to three guards. "You three, come with me. Now." 
      The guards followed. 
      In the doorway, the camerlegno stopped. He turned to Vittoria. "Ms. Vetra. You too. Please come with 
      me." 
      Vittoria hesitated. "Where are we going?" 
      He headed out the door. "To see an old friend." 
                         Angels & Demons      169  
      finally found a lounge where the mood was subdued... almost melancholy. Here the scientists watching 
      the report were some of CERN's oldest and most respected. They did not even look up as Sylvie  
      lipped in and took a  seat. 
      On the other side of CERN, in Leonardo Vetra's frigid apartment, Maximilian Kohler had finished 
      reading the leather -bound journal he'd taken from Vetra's bedside table. Now he was watching the 
      television reports. After a few minutes, he replaced Vetra's journal, turned off the television, and left 
      the apartment. 
      Far away, in Vatican City, Cardinal Mortati carried another tray of ballots to the Sistine Chapel 
      chimney. He burned them, and the smoke was black. 
      Two ballotings. No Pope. 
                         Angels & Demons      171  
      "I'm sorry, that always seems like a strange question. What I mean is that I've always known I would 
      serve God. From the moment I could first think. It wasn't until I was a young man, though, in the 
      military, that I truly understood my purpose." 
      Vittoria was surprised. "You were in the military?" 
      "Two years. I refused to fire a weapon, so they made me fly instead. Medevac helicopters. In fact, I still 
      fly from time to time." 
      Vittoria tried to picture the young priest flying a helicopter. Oddly, she could see him perfectly behind 
      the controls. Camerlegno Ventresca possessed a grit that seemed to accentuate his conviction rather 
      than cloud it. "Did you ever fly the Pope?" 
      "Heavens no. We left that precious cargo to the professionals. His Holiness let me take the helicopter 
      to our retreat in Gandolfo sometimes." He paused, looking at her. "Ms. Vetra, thank you for your help 
      here today. I am very sorry about your father. Truly." 
      "Thank you."  
      "I never knew my father. He died before I was born. I lost my mother when I was ten." 
      Vittoria looked up. "You were orphaned?" She felt a sudden kinship. 
      "I survived an accident. An accident that took my mother." 
      "Who took care of you?" 
      "God," the camerlegno said. "He quite literally sent me another father. A bishop from Palermo 
      appeared at my hospital bed and took me in. At the time I was not surprised. I had sensed God's 
      watchful hand over me even as a boy. The bishop's appearance simply confirmed what I had already 
      suspected, that God had somehow chosen me to serve him." 
      "You believed God chose you?" 
      "I did. And I do." There was no trace of conceit in the camerlegno's voice, only gratitude. "I worked 
      under the bishop's tutelage for many years. He eventually became a cardinal. Still, he never forgot me. 
      He is the father I re member." A beam of a flashlight caught the camerlegno's face, and Vittoria sensed 
      a loneliness in his eyes. 
      The group arrived beneath a towering pillar, and their lights converged on an opening in the floor. 
      Vittoria looked down at the staircase descending into the void and suddenly wanted to turn back. The 
      guards were already helping the camerlegno onto the stairs. They helped her next.  
      "What became of him?" she asked, descending, trying to keep her voice steady. 
      "The cardinal who took you in?" 
      "He left the College of Cardinals for another position." 
      Vittoria was surprised. 
      "And then, I'm sorry to say, he passed on." 
      "Le mie condoglianze," Vittoria said. "Recently?" 
      The camerlegno turned, shadows accentuating the pain on his face. "Exactly fifteen days ago. We are 
      going to see him right now." 
                         Angels & Demons      173  
      Hurrying now, he reached down to lift the volume, but as he did, he saw something that gave him 
      pause. Although th ere were numerous notations throughout the index, the one that had just caught his 
      eye seemed odd. 
      The note indicated that the famous Bernini sculpture, The Ecstasy of St. Teresa, shortly after its 
      unveiling, had been moved from its original location inside the Vatican. This in itself was not what had 
      caught Langdon's eye. He was already familiar with the sculpture's checkered past. Though some 
      thought it a masterpiece, Pope Urban VIII had rejected The Ecstasy of St. Teresa as too sexually 
      explicit for the Vatican. He had banished it to some obscure chapel across town. What had caught 
      Langdon's eye was that the work had apparently been placed in one of the five churches on his list. 
      What was more, the note indicated it had been moved there per suggerimento del artista. By suggestion 
      of the artist? Langdon was confused. It made no sense that Bernini had suggested his masterpiece be 
      hidden in some obscure location. All artists wanted their work displayed prominently, not in some 
      remote- Langdon hesitated. Unless...  
      He was fearful even to entertain the notion. Was it possible? Had Bernini intentionally created a work 
      so explicit that it forced the Vatican to hide it in some out-of-the-way spot? A location perhaps that 
      Bernini himself could suggest? Maybe a remote church on a direct line with West Ponente's breath? 
      As Langdon's excitement mounted, his vague familiarity with the statue intervened, insisting the work 
      had nothing to do with fire. The sculpture, as anyone who had seen it could attest, was anything but 
      scientificpornographic maybe, but certainly not scientific. An English critic had once condemned The 
      Ecstasy of St. Teresa as "the most unfit ornament ever to be placed in a Christian Church." 
      Langdon certainly understood the controversy. Though brilliantly rendered, the statue depicted St. 
      Teresa on her back in the throes of a toe-curling orgasm. Hardly Vatican fare.  
      Langdon hurriedly flipped to the ledger's description of the work. When he saw the sketch, he felt an 
      instantaneous and unexpected tingle of hope. In the sketch, St. Teresa did indeed appear to be enjoying 
      herself, but there was another figure in the statue who Langdon had forgotten was there. 
      An angel. The sordid legend suddenly came back... St. Teresa was a nun sainted after she claimed an 
      angel had paid her a blissful visit in her sleep. Critics later decided her encounter had probably been 
      more sexual than spiritual. Scrawled at the bottom of the ledger, Langdon saw a familiar excerpt. St. 
      Teresa's own words left little to the imagination:... his great golden spear... filled with fire... plunged 
      into me several times... penetrated to my entrails... a sweetness so extreme that one could not possibly 
      wish it to stop.  
      Langdon smiled. If that's not a metaphor for some serious sex, I don't know what is. He was smiling 
      also because of the ledger's description of the work. Although the paragraph was in Italian, the word 
      fu��co appeared a half dozen times:... angel's spear tipped with point of fire... 
      ...angel's head emanating rays of fire... 
      ...woman  inflamed by passion's fire... 
      Langdon was not entirely convinced until he glanced up at the sketch again. The angel's fiery spear was 
      raised like a beacon, pointing the way. Let angels guide you on your lofty quest. Even the type of angel 
      Bernini had selec ted seemed significant. It's a seraphim, Langdon realized. Seraphim literally means 
      "the fiery one." 
      Robert Langdon was not a man who had ever looked for confirmation from above, but when he read 
      the name of the church where the sculpture now resided, he decided he might become a believer after 
      all. Santa Maria della Vittoria. 
      Vittoria, he thought, grinning. Perfect.  
      Staggering to his feet, Langdon felt a rush of dizziness. He glanced up the ladder, wondering if he 
      should replace the book. The hell with it, he thought. Father Jaqui can do it. He closed the book and 
      left it neatly at the bottom of the shelf. 
      As he made his way toward the glowing button on the vault's electronic exit, he was breathing in 
      shallow gasps. Nonetheless, he felt rejuvenated by his good fortune.  
      His good fortune, however, ran out before he reached the exit. 
      Without warning, the vault let out a pained sigh. The lights dimmed, and the exit button went dead. 
      Then, like an enormous expiring beast, the archival complex went totally black. Someone had just 
      killed power. 
                         Angels & Demons      175  
      There was a moment of silence and then the lead guard gave the order. The three men set down their 
      flashlights on the floor, and their shadows leapt overhead. Lit now from beneath, the men advanced 
      toward the tomb. Bracing their hands against the marble covering near the head of the tomb, they 
      planted their feet and prepared to push. On signal, they all thrust, straining against the enormous slab. 
      When the lid did not move at all, Vittoria found herself almost hoping it was too heavy. She was 
      suddenly fearful of what they would find inside. 
      The men pushed harder, and still the stone did not move. 
      "Ancora," the camerlegno said, rolling up the sleeves of his cassock and preparing to push along with 
      them. "Ora!" Everyone heaved. 
      Vittoria was about to offer her own help, but just then, the lid began to slide. The men dug in again, 
      and with an almost primal growl of stone on stone, the lid rotated off the top of the tomb and came to 
      rest at an angle-the Pope's carved head now pushed back into the niche and his feet extended out into 
      the hallway. Everyone stepped back. 
      Tentatively, a guard bent and retrieved his flashlight. Then he aimed it into the tomb. The beam 
      seemed to tremble a moment, and then the guard held it steady. The other guards gathered one by one. 
      Even in the darkness Vittoria sensed them recoil. In succession, they crossed themselves. The 
      camerlegno shuddered when he looked into the tomb, his shoulders dropping like weights. He stood a 
      long moment before turning away. 
      Vittoria had feared the corpse's mouth might be clenched tight with rigor mortis and that she would 
      have to suggest breaking the jaw to see the tongue. She now saw it would be unnecessary. The cheeks 
      had collapsed, and the Pope's mouth gaped wide. His tongue was black as death. 
                         Angels & Demons      177  
      With a burst of confidence, he jumped to his feet far too fast. Swaying in the fog of a head rush, he 
      reached out in the dar k for support. His hand found a stack. Waiting a moment, he forced himself to 
      conserve. He would need all of his strength to do this. 
      Positioning himself against the book stack like a football player against a training sled, he planted his 
      feet and pushed. If I can somehow tip the shelf. But it barely moved. He realigned and pushed again. 
      His feet slipped backward on the floor. The stack creaked but did not move. 
      He needed leverage. Finding the glass wall again, he placed one hand on it to guide him as he raced 
      in the dark toward the far end of the vault. The back wall loomed suddenly, and he collided with it, 
      crushing his shoulder. Cursing, Langdon circled the shelf and grabbed the stack at about eye level. 
      Then, propping one leg on the glass behind him and another on the lower shelves, he started to climb. 
      Books fell around him, fluttering into the darkness. He didn't care. Instinct for survival had long since 
      overridden archival decorum. He sensed his equilibrium was hampered by the total darkness and 
      closed his eyes, coaxing his brain to ignore visual input. He moved faster now. The air felt leaner the 
      higher he went. He scrambled toward the upper shelves, stepping on books, trying to gain purchase, 
      heaving himself upward. Then, like a rock climber conquering a rock face, Langdon grasped the top 
      shelf. Stretching his legs out behind him, he walked his feet up the glass wall until he was almost 
      horizontal. Now or never, Robert, a voice urged. Just like the leg press in the Harvard gym. 
      With dizzying exertion, he planted his feet against the wall behind him, braced his arms and chest 
      against the stack, and pushed. Nothing happened. Fighting for air, he repositioned and tried again, 
      extending his legs. Ever so slightly, the stack moved. He pushed again, and the stack rocked forward an 
      inch or so and then back. Langdon took advantage of the motion, inhaling what felt like an oxygenless 
      breath and heaving again. The shelf rocked farther. 
      Like a swing set, he told himself. Keep the rhythm. A little more. Langdon rocked the shelf, extending 
      his legs farther with each push. His quadriceps burned now, and he blocked the pain. The pendulum 
      was in motion. Three more pushes, he urged himself. 
      It only took two. There was an instant of weightless uncertainty. Then, with a thundering of books 
      sliding off the shelves, Langdon and the shelf were falling forward. Halfway to the ground, the shelf hit 
      the stack next to it. Langdon hung on, throwing his weight forward, urging the second shelf to topple. 
      There was a moment of motionless panic, and then, creaking under the weight, the second stack began 
      to tip. Langdon was falling again. Like enormous dominoes, the stacks began to topple, one after  
      another. Metal on metal, books tumbling everywhere. Langdon held on as his inclined stack bounced 
      downward like a ratchet on a jack. He wondered how many stacks there were in all. How much would 
      they weigh? The glass at the far end was thick... 
      Langdon's stack had fallen almost to the horizontal when he heard what he was waiting for-a different 
      kind of collision. Far off. At the end of the vault. The sharp smack of metal on glass. The vault around 
      him shook, and Langdon knew the final stack, weighted down by the others, had hit the glass hard. 
      The sound that followed was the most unwelcome sound Langdon had ever heard. 
      Silence. 
      There was no crashing of glass, only the resounding thud as the wall accepted the weight of the stacks 
      now propped against it. He lay wide-eyed on the pile of books. Somewhere in the distance there was a 
      creaking. Lang don would have held his breath to listen, but he had none left to hold. One second. 
      Two... Then, as he teetered on the brink of unconsciousness, Langdon heard a distant yielding... a 
      ripple spidering outward through the glass. Suddenly, like a cannon, the glass exploded. The stack 
      beneath Langdon collapsed to the floor. 
      Like welcome rain on a desert, shards of glass tinkled downward in the dark. With a great sucking hiss, 
      the air gushed in.  
      Thirty seconds later, in the Vatican Grottoes, Vittoria was standing before a corpse when the electronic 
      squawk of a walkie -talkie broke the silence. The voice blaring out sounded short of breath. "This is 
      Robert Langdon! Can anyone hear me?" 
      Vittoria looked up. Robert! She could not believe how much she suddenly wished he were there.  
      The guards exchanged puzzled looks. One took a radio off his belt. "Mr. Langdon? You are on channel 
      three. The commander is waiting to hear from you on channel one."

      Langdon's watch, now smeared with blood, read 9:41 P.M. as he ran across the Courtyard of the 
      Belvedere and approached the fountain outside the Swiss Guard security center. His hand had stopped 
      bleeding and now felt worse than it looked. As he arrived, it seemed everyone convened at once-
      Olivetti, Rocher, the camerlegno, Vittoria, and a handful of guards. Vittoria hurried toward him 
      immediately. "Robert, you're hurt." 
      Before Langdon could answer, Olivetti was before him. "Mr. Langdon, I'm relieved you're okay. I'm 
      sorry about the crossed signals in the archives." 
      "Crossed signals?" Langdon demanded. "You knew damn well -" 
      "It was my fault," Rocher said, stepping forward, sounding contrite. "I had no idea you were in the 
      archives. Portions of our white zones are cross-wired with that building. We were extending our search. 
      I'm the one who killed power. If I had known..." 
      "Robert," Vittoria said, taking his wounded hand in hers and looking it over, 
      "the Pope was poisoned. The Illuminati killed him." 
      Langdon heard the words, but they barely registered. He was saturated. All he could feel was the 
      warmth of Vittoria's hands. 
      The camerlegno pulled a silk handkerchief from his cassock and handed it to Langdon so he could 
      clean himself. The man said nothing. His green eyes seemed filled with a new fire. 
      "Robert," Vittoria pressed, "you said you found where the next cardinal is going to be killed?" 
      Langdon felt flighty. "I do, it's at the-" 
      "No," Olivetti interrupted. "Mr. Langdon, when I asked you not to speak another word on the walkie-
      talkie, it was for a reason." He turned to the handful of assembled Swiss Guards. 
      "Excuse us, gentlemen." 
      The soldiers disappeared into the security center. No indignity. Only compliance. 
      Olivetti turned back to the remaining group. "As much as it pains me to say this, the murder of our 
      Pope is an act that could only have been accomplished with help from within these walls. 
      For the good of all, we can trust no one. Including our guards." He seemed to be suffering as he spoke 
      the words.  
      Rocher looked anxious. "Inside collusion implies-" 
      "Yes," Olivetti said. "The integrity of your search is compromised. And yet it is a gamble we must take. 
      Keep looking."  
      Rocher looked like he was about to say something, thought better of it, and left. 
      The camerlegno inhaled deeply. He had not said a word yet, and Langdon sensed a new rigor in the 
      man, as i f a turning point had been reached. 
      "Commander?" The camerlegno's tone was impermeable. "I am going to break conclave." 
      Olivetti pursed his lips, looking dour. "I advise against it. We still have two hours and twenty minutes." 
      "A heartbeat."  
      Olivetti's tone was now challenging "What do you intend to do? Evacuate the cardinals single- 
      handedly?"  
      "I intend to save this church with whatever power God has given me. How I proceed is no longer your 
      concern."  
      Olivetti straightened. "Whatever you intend to do..." He paused. "I do not have the authority to 
      restrain you. Particularly in light of my apparent failure as head of security. I ask only that you wait. 
      Wait twenty minutes... until after ten o'clock. If Mr. Langdon's information is correct, I may still have a 
      chance to catch this assassin. There is still a chance to preserve protocol and decorum." 
      "Decorum?" The camerlegno let out a choked laugh. "We have long since passed propriety, 
      commander. In case you hadn't noticed, this is war." 
      A guard emerged from the security center and called out to the camerlegno, "Signore, I just got word 
      we have detained the BBC reporter, Mr. Glick." 
      The camerlegno nodded. "Have both he and his camerawoman meet me outside the Sistine Chapel."

      Even with its siren now affixed and blaring, Olivetti's Alfa Romeo seemed to go unnoticed as it 
      rocketed across the bridge into the heart of old Rome. All the traffic was moving in the other direction, 
      toward the Vatican, as if the Holy See had suddenly become the hottest entertainment in Rome. 
      Langdon sat in the backseat, the questions whipping through his mind. He wondered about the killer, 
      if they would catch him this time, if he would tell them what they needed to know, if it was already too 
      late. How long before the camerlegno told the crowd in St. Peter's Square they were in danger? The 
      incident in the vault still nagged. A mistake. 
      Olivetti never touched the brakes as he snaked the howling Alfa Romeo toward the Church of Santa 
      Maria della Vittoria. Langdon knew on any other day his knuckles would have been white. At the 
      moment, however, he felt anesthetized. Only the throbbing in his hand reminded him where he was. 
      Overhead, the siren wailed. Nothing like telling him we're coming, Langdon thought. And yet they 
      were making incredible time. He guessed Olivetti would kill the siren as they drew nearer. 
      Now with a moment to sit and reflect, Langdon felt a tinge of amazement as the news of the Pope's 
      murder finally registered in his mind. The thought was inconceivable, and yet somehow it seemed a 
      perfectly logical event. Infiltration had always been the Illuminati powerbase-rearrangements of power 
      from within. And it was not as if Popes had never been murdered. Countless rumors of treachery 
      abounded, although with no autopsy, none was ever confirmed. Until recently. Academics not long ago 
      had gotten permission to X-ray the tomb of Pope Celestine V, who had allegedly died at the hands of 
      his overeager successor, Boniface VIII. The researchers had hoped the X-ray might reveal some small 
      hint of foul play -a broken bone perhaps. Incredibly, the X-ray had revealed a ten-inch nail driven into 
      the Pope's skull. 
      Langdon now recalled a series of news clippings fellow Illuminati buffs had sent him years ago. At first 
      he had thought the clippings were a prank, so he'd gone to the Harvard microfiche collection to 
      confirm the articles were authentic. Incredibly, they were. He now kept them on his bulletin board as 
      examples of how even respectable news organizations sometimes got carried away with Illuminati 
      paranoia. Suddenly, the media's suspicions seemed a lot less paranoid. Langdon could see the articles 
      clearly in his mind...

      Pope John Paul I, who died in 1978, fell victim to a plot by the P2 Masonic Lodge... The secret society 
      P2 decided to murder John Paul I when it saw he was determined to dismiss the American Archbishop 
      Paul Marcinkus as President of the Vatican Bank. The Bank had been implicated in shady financial 
      deals with the Masonic Lodge...

      Why was the late John Paul I wearing his day shirt in bed? Why was it torn? The questions don't stop 
      there. No medical investigations were made. Cardinal Villot forbade an autopsy on the grounds that no 
      Pope was ever given a postmortem. And John Paul's medicines mysteriously vanished from his 
      bedside, as did his glasses, slippers and his last will and testament.  
      LONDON DAILY MAIL  
      August 27, 1998  
      ...a plot including a powerful, ruthless and illegal Masonic lodge with tentacles stretching into the 
      Vatican.  
      The cellular in Vittoria's pocket rang, thankfully erasing the memories from Langdon's mind. 
      Vittoria answered, looking confused as to who might be calling her. Even from a few feet away, 
      Langdon recognized the laserlike voice on the phone. 
      "Vittoria? This is Maximilian Kohler. Have you found the antimatter yet?" 
      "Max? You're o kay?" 
      "I saw the news. There was no mention of CERN or the antimatter. This is good. What is happening?" 
                         Angels & Demons      183  
      "Those who stand in your way are knowledgeable." 
      "You speak of an American scholar?" 
      "You are aware of him?" 
      The Hassassin chuckled. "Cool-tempered but na��ve. He spoke to me on the phone earlier. He is with a 
      female who seems quite the opposite." The killer felt a stirring of arousal as he recalled the fiery 
      temperament of Leonardo Vetra's daughter. There was a momentary silence on the line, the first 
      hesitation the Hassassin had ever sensed from his Illuminati master. Finally, Janus spoke. "Eliminate 
      them if need be." 
      The killer smiled. "Consider it done." He felt a warm anticipation spreading through his body. 
      Although the woman I may keep as a prize.

      comforted to know the camerlegno was taking control. The camerlegno was the person inside Vatican 
      City for whom Cha rtrand held the most respect. Some of the guards thought of the camerlegno as a 
      beato-a religious zealot whose love of God bordered on obsession-but even they agreed... when it 
      came to fighting the enemies of God, the camerlegno was the one man who would stand up and 
      play hardball. The Swiss Guards had seen a lot of the camerlegno this week in preparation for 
      conclave, and everyone had commented that the man seemed a bit rough around the edges, his verdant 
      eyes a bit more intense than usual. Not surprisingly, they had all commented; not only was the  
      camerlegno responsible for planning the sacred conclave, but he had to do it immediately on the heels 
      of the loss of his mentor, the Pope. 
      Chartrand had only been at the Vatican a few months when he heard the story of the bomb that blew 
      up the camerlegno's mother before the kid's very eyes. A bomb in church... and now it's happening all 
      over again. Sadly, the authorities never caught the bastards who planted the bomb... probably some 
      anti-Christian hate group they said, and the case faded away. No wonder the camerlegno despised 
      apathy.  
      A couple months back, on a peaceful afternoon inside Vatican City, Chartrand had bumped into the 
      camerlegno coming across the grounds. The camerlegno had apparently recognized Chartrand as a new  
      guard and invited him to accompany him on a stroll. They had talked about nothing in particular, and 
      the camerlegno made Chartrand feel immediately at home. 
      "Father," Chartrand said, "may I ask you a strange question?" 
      The camerlegno smiled. "Only if I may give you a strange answer." 
      Chartrand laughed. "I have asked every priest I know, and I still don't understand." 
      "What troubles you?" The camerlegno led the way in short, quick strides, his frock kicking out in front 
      of him as he walked. His black, crepe -sole shoess seemed befitting, Chartrand thought, like reflections 
      of the man's essence... modern but humble, and showing signs of wear. 
      Chartrand took a deep breath. "I don't understand this omnipotent-benevolent thing." 
      The camerlegno smiled. "You've been reading Scripture." 
      "I try." 
      "You are confused because the Bible describes God as an omnipotent and benevolent deity." 
      "Exactly."  
      "Omnipotent-benevolent simply means that God is all-powerful and well -meaning."  
      "I understand the concept. It's just... there seems to be a contradiction." 
      "Yes. The contradiction is pain. Man's starvation, war, sickness..." 
      "Exactly!" Chartrand knew the camerlegno would understand. "Terrible things happen in this world. 
      Human tragedy seems like proof that God could not possibly be both all-powerful and well -meaning. 
      If He loves us and has the power to change our situation, He would prevent our pain, wouldn't He?" 
      The camerlegno frowned. "Would He?" 
      Chartrand felt uneasy. Had he overstepped his bounds? Was this one of those religious questions you 
      just didn't ask? "Well... if God loves us, and He can protect us, He would have to. It seems He is either 
      omnipotent and uncaring, or benevolent and powerless to help." 
      "Do you have children, Lieutenant?" 
      Chartrand flushed.  "No, signore."  
      "Imagine you had an eight-year-old son... would you love him?" 
      "Of course."  
      "Would you do everything in your power to prevent pain in his life?" 
      "Of course."  
      "Would you let him skateboard?" 
      Chartrand did a double take. The camerlegno always seemed oddly "in touch" for a clergyman. "Yeah, 
      I guess," Chartrand said. "Sure, I'd let him skateboard, but I'd tell him to be careful." 
      "So as this child's father, you would give him some basic, good advice and then let him go off and 
      make his own mistakes?" 
      "I wouldn't run behind him and mollycoddle him if that's what you mean."  
      "But what if he fell and skinned his knee?" 
      "He would learn to be more careful."

      Langdon and Vittoria observed Piazza Barberini from the shadows of a small alleyway on the western 
      corner. The church was opposite them, a hazy cupola emerging from a faint cluster of buildings across 
      the square. The night had brought with it a welcome cool, and Langdon was surprised to find the 
      square deserted. Above them, through open windows, blaring televisions reminded Langdon where 
      everyone had disappeared to. 
      "... no comment yet from the Vatican... Illuminati murders of two cardinals... satanic presence in 
      Rome... speculation about further infiltration..." 
      The news had spread like Nero's fire. Rome sat riveted, as did the rest of the world. Langdon 
      wondered if they would really be able to stop this runaway train. As he scanned the piazza and waited, 
      Langdon realized that despite the encroachment of modern buildings, the piazza still looked 
      remarkably elliptical. High above, like some sort of modern shrine to a bygone hero, an enormous 
      neon sign blinked on the roof of a luxurious hotel. Vittoria had already pointed it out to Langdon. The 
      sign seemed eerily befitting. 
      HOTEL BERNIN I 
      "Five of ten," Vittoria said, cat eyes darting around the square. No sooner had she spoken the words 
      than she grabbed Langdon's arm and pulled him back into the shadows. She motioned into the center 
      of the square.  
      Langdon followed her gaze. When he saw it, he stiffened. Crossing in front of them, beneath a street 
      lamp, two dark figures appeared. 
      Both were cloaked, their heads covered with dark mantles, the traditional black covering of Catholic 
      widows. Langdon would have guessed they were women, but he couldn't be sure in the dark. One 
      looked elderly and moved as if in pain, hunched over. The other, larger and stronger, was helping. 
      "Give me the gun," Vittoria said. 
      "You can't just-" 
      Fluid as a cat, Vittoria was in and out of his pocket once again. The gun glinted in her hand. Then, in  
      absolute silence, as if her feet never touched the cobblestone, she was circling left in the shadows, 
      arching across the square to approach the couple from the rear. Langdon stood transfixed as Vittoria 
      disappeared.  
      Then, swe aring to himself, he hurried after her.  
      The couple was moving slowly, and it was only a matter of half a minute before Langdon and Vittoria 
      were positioned behind them, closing in from the rear. Vittoria concealed the gun beneath casually 
      crossed arms in front of her, out of sight but accessible in a flash. She seemed to float faster and faster 
      as the gap lessened, and Langdon battled to keep up. When his shoes scuffed a stone and sent it 
      skittering, Vittoria shot him a sideways glare. But the couple did not seem to hear. They were talking. 
      At thirty feet, Langdon could start to hear voices. No words. Just faint murmurings. Beside him, 
      Vittoria moved faster with every step. Her arms loosened before her, the gun starting to peek out. 
      Twenty feet. The voices were clearer -one much louder than the other. Angry. Ranting. Langdon 
      sensed it was the voice of an old woman. Gruff. Androgynous. He strained to hear what she was 
      saying, but another voice cut the night. 
      "Mi scusi!" Vittoria's friendly tone lit the square like a torch.  
      Langdon tensed as the cloaked couple stopped short and began to turn. Vittoria kept striding toward 
      them, even faster now, on a collision course. They would have no time to react. Langdon realized his 
      own feet had stopped moving. From behind, he saw Vittoria's arms loosening, her hand coming free, 
      the gun swinging forward. Then, over her shoulder, he saw a face, lit now in the street lamp. The panic 
      surged to his legs, and he lunged forward. "Vittoria, no!" 
      Vittoria, however, seemed to exist a split second ahead of him. In a motion as swift as it was casual, 
      Vittoria's arms were raised again, the gun disappearing as she clutched herself like a woman on a chilly 
      night. Langdon stumbled to her side, almost colliding with the cloaked couple before them. 
      "Buona sera," Vittoria blurted, her voice startled with retreat. 
                                                                189  
            
                                                   91 
             
            
           Langdon and Vittoria dashed to the main entrance of the church of Santa Maria della Vittoria and 
           found the wooden door locked. Vittoria fired three shots from Olivetti's semi-automatic into the 
           ancient bolt, and it shattered. 
           The church had no anteroom, so the entirety of the sanctuary spread out in one gasping sweep as 
           Langdon and Vittoria threw open the main door. The scene before them was so unexpected, so 
           bizarre, that Langdon had to close his eyes and reopen them before his mind could take it all in. 
           The church was lavish baroque... gilded walls and altars. Dead center of the sanctuary, beneath the 
           main cupola, wooden pews had been stacked high and were now ablaze in some sort of epic funeral 
           pyre. A bonfire shooting high into the dome. As Langdon's eyes followed the inferno upward, the true 
           horror of the scene descended like a bird of prey. 
           High overhead, from the left and right sides of the ceiling, hung two incensor cables-lines used for  
           swinging frankincense vessels above the congregation. These lines, however, carried no incensors now. 
           Nor were they swinging. They had been used for something else... Suspended from the cables was a 
           human being. A naked man. Each wrist had been connected to an opposing cable, and he had been 
           hoisted almost to the  point of being torn apart. 
           His arms were outstretched in a spread-eagle as if he were nailed to some sort of invisible crucifix 
           hovering within the house of God. 
           Langdon felt paralyzed as he stared upward. A moment later, he witnessed the final abomination. The 
           old man was alive, and he raised his head. A pair of terrified eyes gazed down in a silent plea for help. 
           On the man's chest was a scorched emblem. He had been branded. Langdon could not see it clearly, 
           but he had little doubt what the marking said. As the flames climbed higher, lapping at the man's feet, 
           the victim let out a cry of pain, his body trembling. 
           As if ignited by some unseen force, Langdon felt his body suddenly in motion, dashing down the main 
           aisle toward the conflagration. His lungs filled with smoke as he closed in. Ten feet from the inferno, at 
           a full sprint, Langdon hit a wall of heat. The skin on his face singed, and he fell back, shielding his eyes 
           and landing hard on the marble floor. Staggering upright, he pressed forward again, hands raised in 
           protection. Instantly he knew. The fire was far too hot. 
           Moving back again, he scanned the chapel walls. A heavy tapestry, he thought. If I can somehow 
           smother the... But he knew a tapestry was not to be found. This is a baroque chapel, Robert, not some 
           damn German castle! Think! He forced his eyes back to the suspended man. 
           High above, smoke and flames swirled in the cupola. The incensor cables stretched outward from the 
           man's wrists, rising to the ceiling where they passed through pulleys, and descended again to metal 
           cleats on either side of the church. Langdon looked over at one of the cleats. It was high on the wall, 
           but he knew if he could get to it and loosen one of the lines, the tension would slacken and the man 
           would swing wide of t he fire. 
           A sudden surge of flames crackled higher, and Langdon heard a piercing scream from above. The skin 
           on the man's feet was starting to blister. The cardinal was being roasted alive. Langdon fixed his sights 
           on the cleat and ran for it.  
           In the rear o f the church, Vittoria clutched the back of a pew, trying to gather her senses. The image 
           overhead was horrid. She forced her eyes away. Do something! She wondered where Olivetti was. Had 
           he seen the Hassassin? Had he caught him? Where were they now? Vittoria moved forward to help 
           Langdon, but as she did, a sound stopped her. The crackling of the flames was getting louder by the 
           instant, but a second sound also cut the air. A metallic vibration. Nearby. The repetitive pulse seemed 
           to emanate from the end of the pews to her left. It was a stark rattle, like the ringing of a phone, but 
           stony and hard. She clutched the gun firmly and moved down the row of pews. The sound grew 
           louder. On. Off. A recurrent vibration.   
           As she approached the end of the aisle, she sensed the sound was coming from the floor just around 
           the corner at the end of the pews. As she moved forward, gun outstretched in her right hand, she 
                         Angels & Demons      191  
      was looking at the brand on his chest upside down... and yet, as if by the devil's magic, the word made

      Langdon had no idea where he was going. Reflex was his only compass, driving him away from danger. 
      His elbows and knees burned as he clambered beneath the pews. Still he clawed on. Somewhere a 
      voice was telling him to move left. If you can get to the main aisle, you can dash for the exit. He knew 
      it was impossible. There's a wall of flames blocking the main aisle! His mind hunting for options, 
      Langdon scrambled blindly on. The footsteps closed faster now to his right. When it happened, 
      Langdon was unprepared. He had guessed he had another ten feet of pews until he reached the front 
      of the church. He had guessed wrong. Without warning, the cover above him ran out. He 
      froze for an instant, half exposed at the front of the church. Rising in the recess to his left, gargantuan 
      from this vantage point, was the very thing that had brought him here. He had entirely forgotten. 
      Bernini's Ecstasy of St. Teresa rose up like some sort of pornographic still life... the saint on her back, 
      arched in pleasure, mouth open in a moan, and over her, an angel pointing his spear of fire. 
      A bullet exploded in the pew over Langdon's head. He felt his body rise like a sprinter out of a gate. 
      Fueled onl y by adrenaline, and barely conscious of his actions, he was suddenly running, hunched, head 
      down, pounding across the front of the church to his right. As the bullets erupted behind him, 
      Langdon dove yet again, sliding out of control across the marble floor before crashing in a heap 
      against the railing of a niche on the right -hand wall. 
      It was then that he saw her. A crumpled heap near the back of the church. Vittoria! Her bare legs were 
      twisted beneath her, but Langdon sensed somehow that she was breathing. He had no time to help her. 
      Immediately, the killer rounded the pews on the far left of the church and bore relentlessly down. 
      Langdon knew in a heartbeat it was over. The killer raised the weapon, and Langdon did the only thing 
      he could do.   
      He rolled his body over the banister into the niche. As he hit the floor on the other side, the marble 
      columns of the balustrade exploded in a storm of bullets. 
      Langdon felt like a cornered animal as he scrambled deeper into the semicircular niche. Rising before 
      him, the niche's sole contents seemed ironically apropos-a single sarcophagus. Mine perhaps, Langdon 
      thought. Even the casket itself seemed fitting. It was a sc��tola-a small, unadorned, marble box. Burial 
      on a budget. The casket was raised off the floor on two marble blocks, and Langdon eyed the opening 
      beneath it, wondering if he could slide through. 
      Footsteps echoed behind him. 
      With no other option in sight, Langdon pressed himself to the floor and slithered toward the casket. 
      Grabbing the two marble supports, one with each hand, he pulled like a breaststroker, dragging his 
      torso into the opening beneath the tomb. The gun went off. 
      Accompanying the roar of the gun, Langdon felt a sensation he had never felt in his life... a bullet 
      sailing past his flesh. There was a hiss of wind, like the backlash of a whip, as the bullet just missed him 
      and exploded in the marble with a puff of dust. Blood surging, Langdon heaved his body the rest of 
      the way beneath the casket. Scrambling across the marble floor, he pulled himself out from beneath the 
      casket and to the other side. 
      Dead end.  
      Langdon was now face to face with the rear wall of the niche. He had no doubt that this tiny space 
      behind the tomb would become his grave. And soon, he realized, as he saw the barrel of the gun 
      appear in the opening beneath the sarcophagus. The Hassassin held the weapon parallel with the floor, 
      pointing directly at Langdon's midsection. 
      Impossible to miss. 
      Langdon felt a trace of self-preservation grip his unconscious mind. He twisted his body onto his 
      stomach, parallel with the casket. Facedown, he planted his hands flat on the floor, the glass cut from 
      the archives pinching open with a stab. Ignoring the pain, he pushed. Driving his body upward in an 
      awkward push -up, Langdon arched his stomach off the floor just as the gun went off. He could feel 
      the shock wave of the bullets as they sailed beneath him and pulverized the porous travertine behind. 
      Closing his eyes and straining against exhaustion, Langdon prayed for the thunder to stop.

      Sitting in the Sistine Chapel among his stunned colleagues, Cardinal Mortati tried to comprehend the 
      words he was  hearing. Before him, lit only by the candlelight, the camerlegno had just told a tale of 
      such hatred and treachery that Mortati found himself trembling. The camerlegno spoke of kidnapped 
      cardinals, branded cardinals, murdered cardinals. He spoke of the ancient Illuminati-a name that 
      dredged up forgotten fears -and of their resurgence and vow of revenge against the church. With pain 
      in his voice, the camerlegno spoke of his late Pope... the victim of an Illuminati poisoning. And finally, 
      his words almost a whisper, he spoke of a deadly new technology, antimatter, which in less than two 
      hours threatened to destroy all of Vatican City. 
      When he was through, it was as if Satan himself had sucked the air from the room. Nobody could 
      move. The camerlegno's words hung in the darkness. The only sound Mortati could now hear was the 
      anomalous hum of a television camera in back-an electronic presence no conclave in history had ever 
      endured-but a presence demanded by the camerlegno. 
      To the utter astonishment of the cardinals, the camerlegno had entered the Sistine Chapel with two 
      BBC reporters-a man and a woman-and announced that they would be transmitting his solemn 
      statement, live to the world. 
      Now, speaking directly to the camera, the camerlegno stepped forward. "To the Illuminati," he said, his 
      voice deepening, "and to those of science, let me say this." He paused. "You have won the war." 
      The silence spread now to the deepest corners of the chapel. Mortati could hear the desperate 
      thumping of his own heart.  
      "The wheels have been in motion for a long time," the camerlegno said. "Your victory has been 
      inevitable. Never before has it been as obvious as it is at this moment. Science is the new God." 
      What is he saying! Mortati thought. Has he gone mad? The entire world is hearing this! 
      "Medicine, electronic communications, space travel, genetic manipulation... these are the miracles 
      about which we now tell our children. These are the miracles we herald as proof that science will bring 
      us the answers. The ancient stories of immaculate conceptions, burning bushes, and parting seas are no 
      longer relevant. God has become obsolete. Science has won the battle. We concede." 
      A rustle of confusion and bewilderment swept through the chapel. 
      "But science's victory," the camerlegno added, his voice intensifying, "has cost every one of us. And it 
      has cost us deeply." 
      Silence. 
      "Science may have alleviated the miseries of disease and drudgery and provided an array of gadgetry for 
      our entertainment and convenience, but it has left us in a world without wonder. Our sunsets have 
      been reduced to wavelengths and frequencies. The complexities of the universe have been shredded 
      into mathematical equations. Even our self-worth as human beings has been destroyed. Science 
      proclaims that Planet Earth and it s inhabitants are a meaningless speck in the grand scheme. A cosmic 
      accident." He paused. "Even the technology that promises to unite us, divides us. Each of us is now 
      electronically connected to the globe, and yet we feel utterly alone. We are bombarded with violence, 
      division, fracture, and betrayal. Skepticism has become a virtue. Cynicism and demand for proof has 
      become enlightened thought. Is it any wonder that humans now feel more depressed and defeated than 
      they have at any point in human history? Does science hold anything sacred? Science looks for answers 
      by probing our unborn fetuses. Science even presumes to rearrange our own DNA. It shatters God's 
      world into smaller and smaller pieces in quest of meaning... and all it finds is more questions." 
      Mortati watched in awe. The camerlegno was almost hypnotic now. He had a physical strength in his 
      movements and voice that Mortati had never witnessed on a Vatican altar. The man's voice was 
      wrought with conviction and sadness. 
      "The ancient war between science and religion is over," the camerlegno said. "You have won. But you 
      have not won fairly. You have not won by providing answers. You have won by so radically reorienting 
      our society that the truths we once saw as signposts now seem inapplicable. Religion cannot keep up. 
                         Angels & Demons      197  
      understand, something to which we are accountable... With faith we are accountable to each other, to 
      ourselves, and to a higher truth. Religion is flawed, but only because man is flawed. If the outside 
      world could see this church as I do... looking beyond the ritual of these walls... they would see a 
      modern miracle... a brotherhood of imperfect, simple souls wanting only to be a voice of compassion 
      in a world spinning out of control." 
      The camerlegno motioned out over the College of Cardinals, and the BBC camerawoman instinctively 
      followed, panning the crowd. 
      "Are we obs olete?" the camerlegno asked. "Are these men dinosaurs? Am I? Does the world really 
      need a voice for the poor, the weak, the oppressed, the unborn child? Do we really need souls like 
      these who, though imperfect, spend their lives imploring each of us to read the signposts of morality 
      and not lose our way?" 
      Mortati now realized that the camerlegno, whether consciously or not, was making a brilliant move. By 
      showing the cardinals, he was personalizing the church. Vatican City was no longer a building, it was 
      people-people like the camerlegno who had spent their lives in the service of goodness. 
      "Tonight we are perched on a precipice," the camerlegno said. "None of us can afford to be apathetic. 
      Whether you see this evil as Satan, corruption, or immorality... the dark force is alive and growing every 
      day. Do not ignore it." The camerlegno lowered his voice to a whisper, and the camera moved in. "The 
      force, though mighty, is not invincible. Goodness can prevail. Listen to your hearts. Listen to God. 
      Together we c an step back from this abyss." 
      Now Mortati understood. This was the reason. Conclave had been violated, but this was the only way. 
      It was a dramatic and desperate plea for help. The camerlegno was speaking to both his enemy and his 
      friends now. He was entreating anyone, friend or foe, to see the light and stop this madness. Certainly 
      someone listening would realize the insanity of this plot and come forward. 
      The camerlegno knelt at the altar. "Pray with me." 
      The College of Cardinals dropped to their knees to join him in prayer. Outside in St. Peter's Square and 
      around the globe... a stunned world knelt with them.

      Like a recurring theme in some demonic symphony, the suffocating darkness had returned. 
      No light. No air. No exit. Langdon lay trapped beneath the overturned sarcophagus and felt his mind 
      careening dangerously close to the brink. Trying to drive his thoughts in any direction other than the 
      crushing space around him, Langdon urged his mind toward some logical process... mathematics, 
      music, anything. But there was no room for calming thoughts. I can't move! I can't breathe! The 
      pinched sleeve of his jacket had thankfully come free when the casket fell, leaving Langdon now with 
      two mobile arms. Even so, as he pressed upward on the ceiling of his tiny cell, he found it immovable. 
      Oddly, he wished his sleeve were still caught. At least it might create a crack for some air. 
      As Langdon pushed against the roof above, his sleeve fell back to reveal the faint glow of an old friend. 
      Mickey. The greenish cartoon face seemed mocking now. 
      Langdon probed the blackness for any other sign of light, but the casket rim was flush against the 
      floor. Goddamn Italian perfectionists, he cursed, now imperiled by the same artistic excellence he 
      taught his students to revere... impeccable edges, faultless parallels, and of course, use only of the most 
      seamless and resilient Carrara marble. 
      Precision can be suffocating.  
      "Lift the damn thing," he said aloud, pressing harder through the tangle of bones. The box shifted 
      slightly. 
      Setting his jaw, he heaved again. The box felt like a boulder, but this time it raised a quarter of an inch. 
      A fleeting glimmer of light surrounded him, and then the casket thudded back down. Langdon lay 
      panting in the dark. He tried to use his legs to lift as he had before, but now that the sarcophagus had 
      fallen flat, there was no room even to straighten his knees. 
      As the claustrophobic panic closed in, Langdon was overcome by images of the sarcophagus shrinking 
      around him. Squeezed by delirium, he fought the illusion with every logical shred of intellect he had. 
      "Sarcophagus," he stated aloud, with as much academic sterility as he could muster. But even erudition 
      seemed to be his enemy today. Sarcophagus is from the Greek "sarx"meaning "flesh," and "phagein" 
      meaning "to eat." I'm trapped in a box literally designed to "eat flesh." 
      Images of flesh eaten from bone only served as a grim reminder that Langdon lay covered in human 
      remains. The notion brought nausea and chills. But it also brought an idea. Fumbling blindly around 
      the coffi n, Langdon found a shard of bone. A rib maybe? He didn't care. All he wanted was a wedge. If 
      he could lift the box, even a crack, and slide the bone fragment beneath the rim, then maybe enough 
      air could... 
      Reaching across his body and wedging the tapered end of the bone into the crack between the floor 
      and the coffin, Langdon reached up with his other hand and heaved skyward. The box did not move. 
      Not even slightly. He tried again. For a moment, it seemed to tremble slightly, but that was all. 
      With the fetid stench and lack of oxygen choking the strength from his body, Langdon realized he only 
      had time for one more effort. He also knew he would need both arms. 
      Regrouping, he placed the tapered edge of the bone against the crack, and shifting his body, he wedged 
      the bone against his shoulder, pinning it in place. Careful not to dislodge it, he raised both hands above 
      him. As the stifling confine began to smother him, he felt a welling of intensified panic. It was the 
      second time today he had been trapped with no air. Hollering aloud, Langdon thrust upward in one 
      explosive motion. 
      The casket jostled off the floor for an instant. But long enough. The bone shard he had braced against 
      his shoulder slipped outward into the widening crack. When the casket fell again, the bone shattered. 
      But this time Langdon could see the casket was propped up. A tiny slit of light showed beneath the 
      rim. 
      Exhausted, Langdon collapsed. Hoping the strangling sensation in his throat would pass, he waited. 
      But it only worsened as the seconds passed. Whatever air was coming through the slit seemed 
      imperceptible.

      The Hassassin smiled as he pulled his van into the mammoth stone structure overlooking the Tiber 
      River. He carried his prize up and up... spiraling higher in the stone tunnel, grateful his load was  
      slender. He arrived at the door. The Church of Illumination, he gloated. The ancient Illuminati meeting 
      room. Who would have imagined it to be here? 
      Inside, he lay her on a plush divan. Then he expertly bound her arms behind her back and tied her feet. 
      He knew that what he longed for would have to wait until his final task was finished. Water. Still, he 
      thought, he had a moment for indulgence. Kneeling beside her, he ran his hand along her thigh. It was 
      smooth. Higher. His dark fingers snaked beneath the cuff of her shorts. 
      Higher. 
      He stopped. Patience, he told himself, feeling aroused. There is work to be done.  
      He walked for a moment out onto the chamber's high stone balcony. The evening breeze slowly cooled 
      his ardor. Far below the Tiber raged. He raised his eyes to the dome of St. Peter's, three quarters of a 
      mile away, naked under the glare of hundreds of press lights. "Your final hour," he said aloud, picturing 
      the thousands of Muslims slaughtered during the Crusades. "At midnight you will meet your God." 
      Behind him, the woman stirred. The Hassassin turned. He considered letting her wake up. Seeing 
      terror in a woman's eyes was his ultimate aphrodisiac. 
      He opted for prudence. It would be better if she remained unconscious while he was gone. Although 
      she was tied and would never escape, the Hassassin did not want to return and find her exhausted from 
      struggling. I want your strength preserved... for me. 
      Lifting her head slightly, he placed his palm beneath her neck and found the hollow directly beneath 
      her skull. The crown/meridian pressure point was one he had used countless times. With crushing 
      force,  he drove his thumb into the soft cartilage and felt it depress. The woman slumped instantly. 
      Twenty minutes, he thought. She would be a tantalizing end to a perfect day. After she had served him 
      and died doing it, he would stand on the balcony and watch the midnight Vatican fireworks.  
      Leaving his prize unconscious on the couch, the Hassassin went downstairs into a torchlit dungeon. 
      The final task. He walked to the table and revered the sacred, metal forms that had been left there for 
      him. 
      Water. It was hi s last. 
      Removing a torch from the wall as he had done three times already, he began heating the end. When 
      the end of the object was white hot, he carried it to the cell. 
      Inside, a single man stood in silence. Old and alone. 
      "Cardinal Baggia," the killer hissed. "Have you prayed yet?" 
      The Italian's eyes were fearless. "Only for your soul."

      Any word from Olivetti?" the  camerlegno asked, looking drained as Rocher escorted him back from 
      the Sistine Chapel to the Pope's office. 
      "No, signore. I am fearing the worst." 
      When they reached the Pope's office, the camerlegno's voice was heavy. "Captain, there is nothing 
      more I can  do here tonight. I fear I have done too much already. I am going into this office to pray. I 
      do not wish to be disturbed. The rest is in God's hands." 
      "Yes, signore." 
      "The hour is late, Captain. Find that canister." 
      "Our search continues." Rocher hesitated. "The weapon proves to be too well hidden." 
      The camerlegno winced, as if he could not think of it. "Yes. At exactly 11:15 P.M., if the church is still 
      in peril, I want you to evacuate the cardinals. I am putting their safety in your hands. I ask only one 
      thing. Let these men proceed from this place with dignity. Let them exit into St. Peter's Square and 
      stand side by side with the rest of the world. I do not want the last image of this church to be 
      frightened old men sneaking out a back door." 
      "Very good, signore. And you? Shall I come for you at 11:15 as well?" 
      "There will be no need." 
      "Signore?" 
      "I will leave when the spirit moves me." 
      Rocher wondered if the camerlegno intended to go down with the ship. 
      The camerlegno opened the door to the Pope's office and entered.   
      "Actually..." he said, turning. "There is one thing." 
      "Signore?" 
      "There seems to be a chill in this office tonight. I am trembling." 
      "The electric heat is out. Let me lay you a fire." 
      The camerlegno smiled tiredly. "Thank you. Thank you, very much."  
      Rocher exited the Pope's office where he had left the camerlegno praying by firelight in front of a small 
      statue of the Blessed Mother Mary. It was an eerie sight. A black shadow kneeling in the flickering 
      glow. 
      As Rocher headed down the hall, a guard appeared, running toward him. Even by candlelight Rocher 
      recognized Lieutenant Chartrand. Young, green, and eager.  
      "Captain," Chartrand called, holding out a cellular phone. "I think the camerlegno's address may have 
      worked. We've got a caller here who says he has information that can help us. He phoned on one of 
      the Vatican's private extensions. I have no idea how he got the number." 
      Rocher stopped. "What?" 
      "He will only speak to the ranking officer." 
      "Any word from Olivetti?" 
      "No, sir."  
      He took the  receiver. "This is Captain Rocher. I am ranking officer here." 
      "Rocher," the voice said. "I will explain to you who I am. Then I will tell you what you are going to do 
      next." 
      When the caller stopped talking and hung up, Rocher stood stunned. He now knew from whom he 
      was taking orders.  
      Back at CERN, Sylvie Baudeloque was frantically trying to keep track of all the licensing inquiries 
      coming in on Kohler's voice mail. When the private line on the director's desk began to ring, Sylvie 
      jumped. Nobody had that number. She answered. 
      "Yes?" 
      "Ms. Baudeloque? This is Director Kohler. Contact my pilot. My jet is to be ready in five minutes."

      Directly over the recumbent saint, against a backdrop of gilded flame, hovered Bernini's angel. The 
      angel's hand clutched a pointed spear of fire. Langdon's eyes followed the direction of the shaft, 
      arching toward the right side of the church. His eyes hit the wall. He scanned the spot where the spear 
      was pointing. There was nothing there. Langdon knew, of course, the spear was pointing far beyond 
      the wall, into the night, somewhere across Rome. 
      "What direction is that?" Langdon asked, turning and addressing the chief with a newfound 
      determination.  
      "Direction?" The chief glanced where Langdon was pointing. He sounded confused. 
      "I don't know... west, I think." 
      "What churches are in that direction?" 
      The chief's puzzlement seemed to deepen. "Dozens. Why?" 
      Langdon frowned. Of course there were dozens. "I need a city map. Right away." 
      The chief sent someone running out to the fire truck for a map. Langdon turned back to the statue. 
      Earth... Air... Fire... VITTORIA.  
      The final marker is Water, he told himself. Bernini's Water. It was in a church out there somewhere. A 
      needle in a hayst ack. He spurred his mind through all the Bernini works he could recall. I need a tribute 
      to Water! 
      Langdon flashed on Bernini's statue of Triton-the Greek God of the sea. Then he realized it was 
      located in the square outside this very church, in entirely the wrong direction. He forced himself to 
      think. What figure would Bernini have carved as a glorification of water? Neptune and Apollo? 
      Unfortunately that statue was in London's Victoria & Albert Museum. 
      "Signore?" A fireman ran in with a map. Langdon thanked him and spread it out on the altar. He 
      immediately realized he had asked the right people; the fire department's map of Rome was as detailed 
      as any Langdon had ever seen. 
      "Where are we now?" 
      The man pointed. "Next to Piazza Barberini." 
      Langdon looked at  the angel's spear again to get his bearings. The chief had estimated correctly. 
      According to the map, the spear was pointing west. Langdon traced a line from his current location 
      west across the map. Almost instantly his hopes began to sink. It seemed that with every inch his finger 
      traveled, he passed yet another building marked by a tiny black cross. Churches. The city was riddled 
      with them. Finally, Langdon's finger ran out of churches and trailed off into the suburbs of Rome. 
      He exhaled and stepped back from the map. Damn. 
      Surveying the whole of Rome, Langdon's eyes touched down on the three churches where the first 
      three cardinals had been killed. The Chigi Chapel... St. Peter's... here... Seeing them all laid out before 
      him now, Langdon noted an oddity in their locations. Somehow he had imagined the churches would 
      be scattered randomly across Rome. But they most definitely were not. 
      Improbably, the three churches seemed to be separated systematically, in an enormous city-wide 
      triangle. Langdon double-checked. He was not imagining things. "Penna," he said suddenly, without 
      looking up. Someone handed him a ballpoint pen. 
      Langdon circled the three churches. His pulse quickened. He triple-checked his markings. A 
      symmetrical triangle!  
      Langdon's first thought  was for the Great Seal on the one-dollar bill-the triangle containing the all-
      seeing eye. But it didn't make sense. He had marked only three points. There were supposed to be four 
      in all. So where the hell is Water? Langdon knew that anywhere he placed the fourth point, the triangle 
      would be destroyed. The only option to retain the symmetry was to place the fourth marker inside the 
      triangle, at the center. He looked at the spot on the map. Nothing. The idea bothered him anyway. 
      The four elements of science were considered equal. Water was not special; Water would not be at the 
      center of the others. 
      Still, his instinct told him the systematic arrangement could not possibly be accidental. I'm not yet 
      seeing the whole picture. There was only one alternative. The four points did not make a triangle; they 
      made some other shape. Langdon looked at the map. A square, perhaps? Although a square made no 
      symbolic sense, squares were symmetrical at least. Langdon put his finger on the map at one of the 
      points that would turn the triangle into 
                         Angels & Demons      207  
      Without a word, Langdon slipped out the door and skirted the press, who were now entering the 
      church in droves. He crossed Piazza Barberini. In the shadows he turned on the walkie-talkie. He tried 
      to hail Vatican City but heard nothing but static. He was either out of range or the transmitter needed 
      some kind of authorization code. Langdon adjusted the complex dials and buttons to no avail. 
      Abruptly, he realized his plan to get help was not going to work. He spun, looking for a pay phone. 
      None. 
      Vatican circuits were jammed anyway. 
      He was alone.  
      Feeling his initial surge of confidence decay, Langdon stood a moment and took stock of his pitiful 
      state- covered in bone dust, cut, deliriously exhausted, and hungry. 
      Langdon glanced back at the church. Smoke spiraled over the cupola, lit by the media lights and fire 
      trucks. He wondered if he should go back and get help. Instinct warned him however that extra help, 
      especially untrained help, would be nothing but a liability. If the Hassassin sees us coming... He 
      thought of Vittoria and knew this would be his final chance to face her captor. 
      Piazza Navona, he thought, knowing he could get there in plenty of time and stake it out. He scanned 
      the area for a taxi, but the streets were almost entirely deserted. Even the taxi drivers, it seemed, had 
      dropped  everything to find a television. Piazza Navona was only about a mile away, but Langdon had 
      no intention of wasting precious energy on foot. He glanced back at the church, wondering if he could 
      borrow a vehicle from someone. 
      A fire truck? A press van? Be serious. 
      Sensing options and minutes slipping away, Langdon made his decision. Pulling the gun from his 
      pocket, he committed an act so out of character that he suspected his soul must now be possessed. 
      Running over to a lone Citro��n sedan idling at a stoplight, Langdon pointed the weapon through 
      the driver's open window.  
      "Fuori!" he yelled.  
      The trembling man got out.  
      Langdon jumped behind the wheel and hit the gas. 
                         Angels & Demons      209  
      "Have you ever heard of slander, Glick? Liability?" 
      "Have you ever heard of real journalism!" 
      "Journalism? You were pulling bullshit out of thin air! I should have turned off the camera! And what 
      the hell was that crap about CERN's corporate logo? Satanic symbology? Have you lost your mind?" 
      Glick smiled. Macri's jealousy was definitely showing. The CERN logo had been the most brilliant 
      coup of all. Ever  since the camerlegno's address, all the networks were talking about CERN and 
      antimatter. Some stations were showing the CERN corporate logo as a backdrop. The logo seemed 
      standard enough -two intersecting circles representing two particle accelerators, and five tangential  
      lines representing particle injection tubes. The whole world was staring at this logo, but it had been 
      Glick, a bit of a symbologist himself, who had first seen the Illuminati symbology hidden in it.  
      "You're not a symbologist," Macri chided, "you're just one lucky -ass reporter. You should have left the 
      symbology to the Harvard guy." 
      "The Harvard guy missed it," Glick said. 
      The Illuminati significance in this logo is so obvious! He was beaming inside. Although CERN had lots 
      of accelerators, their logo showed only two. Two is the Illuminati number of duality. Although most 
      accelerators had only one injection tube, the logo showed five. Five is the number of the Illuminati 
      pentagram. Then had come the coup-the most brilliant point of all. 
      Glick pointed out that the logo contained a large numeral "6-clearly formed by one of the lines and 
      circlesand when the logo was rotated, another six appeared... and then another. The logo contained 
      three sixes! 666! The devil's number! The mark of the beast! 
      Glick was a genius.  
      Macri looked ready to slug him. 
      The jealousy would pass, Glick knew, his mind now wandering to another thought. If CERN was 
      Illuminati headquarters, was CERN where the Illuminati kept their infamous Illuminati Diamond? 
      Glick had read abo ut it on the Internet-"a flawless diamond, born of the ancient elements with such 
      perfection that all those who saw it could only stand in wonder." Glick wondered if the secret 
      whereabouts of the Illuminati Diamond might be yet another mystery he could unveil tonight. 
                         Angels & Demons      211  
      opposite the van. The fountain's massive centerpiece obscured his view. Standing, he ran directly 
      toward the basin. He hoped the thundering water was drowning his footsteps. When he reached the 
      fountain, he climbed over the rim and dropped into the foaming pool. 
      The water was waist deep and like ice. Langdon grit his teeth and plowed through the water. The 
      bottom was slippery, made doubly treacherous by a stratum of coins thrown for good luck. Langdon 
      sensed he would need more than good luck. As the mist rose all around him, he wondered if it was the 
      cold or the fear that was causing the gun in his hand to shake. 
      He reached the interior of the fountain and circled back to his left. He waded hard, clinging to the 
      cover of the marble forms. Hiding himself behind the huge carved form of a horse, Langdon peered 
      out. The van was only fifteen feet away. The Hassassin was crouched on the floor of the van, hands 
      planted on the cardinal's chain-clad body, preparing to roll him out the open door into the fountain. 
      Waist-deep in water, Robert Langdon raised his gun and stepped out of the mist, feeling like some sort 
      of aquatic cowboy making a final stand. "Don't move." His voice was steadier than the gun.  
      The Hassassin looked up. For a moment he seemed confused, as though he had seen a ghost. Then his 
      lips curled into an evil smile. He raised his arms in submission. "And so it goes." 
      "Get out of the van." 
      "You look wet."  
      "You're early." 
      "I am eag er to return to my prize." 
      Langdon leveled the gun. "I won't hesitate to shoot." 
      "You've already hesitated." 
      Langdon felt his finger tighten on the trigger. The cardinal lay motionless now. 
      He looked exhausted, moribund. "Untie him." 
      "Forget him. You've come for the woman. Do not pretend otherwise." 
      Langdon fought the urge to end it right there. "Where is she?"  
      "Somewhere safe. Awaiting my return." 
      She's alive. Langdon felt a ray of hope. "At the Church of Illumination?" 
      The killer smiled. "You will never  find its location."  
      Langdon was incredulous. The lair is still standing. He aimed the gun. "Where?" 
      "The location has remained secret for centuries. Even to me it was only revealed recently. I would die 
      before I break that trust." 
      "I can find it without yo u." 
      "An arrogant thought." 
      Langdon motioned to the fountain. "I've come this far." 
      "So have many. The final step is the hardest." 
      Langdon stepped closer, his footing tentative beneath the water. The Hassassin looked remarkably 
      calm, squatting there in the  back of the van with his arms raised over his head. Langdon aimed at his 
      chest, wondering if he should simply shoot and be done with it. No. He knows where Vittoria is. He 
      knows where the antimatter is. I need information! 
      From the darkness of the van the Hassassin gazed out at his aggressor and couldn't help but feel an 
      amused pity. The American was brave, that he had proven. But he was also untrained. That he had also 
      proven. Valor without expertise was suicide. There were rules of survival. Ancient rules. And the 
      American was breaking all of them. 
      You had the advantage-the element of surprise. You squandered it. The American was indecisive... 
      hoping for backup most likely... or perhaps a slip of the tongue that would reveal critical information. 
      Never interrogate before you disable your prey. A cornered enemy is a deadly enemy. 
      The American was talking again. Probing. Maneuvering. The killer almost laughed aloud. This is not 
      one of your Hollywood movies... there will be no long discussions at gunpoint before the final shoot -
      out. This is the end. Now. 
      Without breaking eye contact, the killer inched his hands across the ceiling of the van until he found 
      what he was looking for. Staring dead ahead, he grasped it. 
      Then he made his play. 
      The motion was utterly u nexpected. For an instant, Langdon thought the laws of physics had ceased to 
                         Angels & Demons      213  
        
                           103 
       
       
      A s a water polo player, Robert Langdon had endured more than his fair share of underwater battles. 
      The competitive savagery that raged beneath the surface of a water polo pool, away from the eyes of 
      the referees, could rival even the ugliest wrestling match. Langdon had been kicked, scratched, held, 
      and even bitten once by a frustrated defenseman from whom Langdon had continuously twisted away. 
      Now, though, thrashing in the frigid water of Bernini's fountain, Langdon knew he was a long way 
      from the Harvard pool. He was fighting not for a game, but for his life. This was the second time they 
      had battled. No referees here. No rematches. The arms driving his face toward the bottom of the basin 
      thrust with a force that left no doubt that it intended to kill. 
      Langdon instinctively spun like a torpedo. Break the hold! But the grip torqued him back, his attacker 
      enjoying an advantage no water polo defenseman ever had-two feet on solid ground. Langdon  
      contorted, trying to get his own feet beneath him. The Hassassin seemed to be favoring one arm... but 
      nonetheless, his grip held firm. 
      It was then that Langdon knew he was not coming up. He did the only thing he could think of to do. 
      He stopped trying to  surface. If you can't go north, go east. Marshalling the last of his strength, 
      Langdon dolphin-kicked his legs and pulled his arms beneath him in an awkward butterfly stroke. His 
      body lurched forward.  
      The sudden switch in direction seemed to take the Hassassin off guard. Langdon's lateral motion 
      dragged his captor's arms sideways, compromising his balance. The man's grip faltered, and Langdon 
      kicked again. The sensation felt like a towline had snapped. Suddenly Langdon was free. 
      Blowing the stale air from his lungs, Langdon clawed for the surface. A single breath was all he got. 
      With crashing force the Hassassin was on top of him again, palms on his shoulders, all of his weight 
      bearing down.   
      Langdon scrambled to plant his feet beneath him but the Hassassin's leg swung out, cutting Langdon 
      down. 
      He went under again.  
      Langdon's muscles burned as he twisted beneath the water. This time his maneuvers were in vain. 
      Through the bubbling water, Langdon scanned the bottom, looking for the gun. Everything was 
      blurred. The bubbles were denser here. A blinding light flashed in his face as the killer wrestled him 
      deeper, toward a submerged spotlight bolted on the floor of the fountain. Langdon reached out, 
      grabbing the canister. It was hot. 
      Langdon tried to pull himself free, but the contraption was mounted on hinges and pivoted in his 
      hand. His leverage was instantly lost. The Hassassin drove him deeper still. It was then Langdon saw it. 
      Poking out from under the coins directly beneath his face. A narrow, black cylinder. The silencer of 
      Olivetti's gun! Langdon reached out, but as his fingers wrapped around the cylinder, he did not feel 
      metal, he felt plastic. When he pulled, the flexible rubber hose came flopping toward him like a flimsy 
      snake. It was about two feet long with a jet of bubbles surging from the end. 
      Langdon had not found the gun at all. It was one of the fountain's many harmless spumanti... bubble 
      makers.  
      Only a few feet away, Cardinal Baggia felt his soul straining to leave his body. 
      Although he had prepared  for this moment his entire life, he had never imagined the end would be like 
      this. His physical shell was in agony... burned, bruised, and held underwater by an immovable weight. 
      He reminded himself that this suffering was nothing compared to what Jesus had endured. He died for 
      my sins... Baggia could hear the thrashing of a battle raging nearby. He could not bear the thought of it. 
      His captor was about to extinguish yet another life... the man with kind eyes, the man who had tried to 
      help. As the pain mou nted, Baggia lay on his back and stared up through the water at the black sky 
      above him.  
      For a moment he thought he saw stars. 
      It was time.  
      Releasing all fear and doubt, Baggia opened his mouth and expelled what he knew would be his final 
                         Angels & Demons      215  
                           104 
        
       
      Robert Langdon lay on a bed of coins at the bottom of the Fountain of the Four Rivers. His mouth 
      was still wrapped around the plastic hose. The air being pumped through the spumanti tube to froth 
      the fountain had been polluted by the pump, and his throat burned. He was not complaining, though. 
      He was alive.  
      He was not sure how accurate his imitation of a drowning man had been, but having been around 
      water his entire life, Langdon had certainly heard accounts. He had done his best. Near the end, he had 
      even blown all the air from his lungs and stopped breathing so that his muscle mass would carry his 
      body to the floor.  
      Thankfully, the Hassassin had bought it and let go. 
      Now, resting on the bottom of the fountain, Langdon had waited as long as he could wait. He was 
      about to start choking. He wondered if the Hassassin was still out there. Taking an acrid breath from 
      the tube, Langdon let go and swam across the bottom of the fountain until he found the smooth swell 
      of the central core. Silently, he followed it upward, surfacing out of sight, in the shadows beneath the 
      huge marble figures.  
      The van was gone. 
      That was all Langdon needed to see. Pulling a long breath of fresh air back into his lungs, he scrambled 
      back toward where Cardinal Baggia had gone down. Langdon knew the man would be unconscious 
      now, and chances of revival were slim, but he had to try. When Langdon found the body, he planted 
      his feet on  either side, reached down, and grabbed the chains wrapped around the cardinal. Then 
      Langdon pulled. When the cardinal broke water, Langdon could see the eyes were already rolled 
      upward, bulging. Not a good sign. There was no breath or pulse. 
      Knowing he cou ld never get the body up and over the fountain rim, Langdon lugged Cardinal Baggia 
      through the water and into the hollow beneath the central mound of marble. Here the water became 
      shallow, and there was an inclined ledge. Langdon dragged the naked body up onto the ledge as far as 
      he could. Not far.  
      Then he went to work. Compressing the cardinal's chain-clad chest, Langdon pumped the water from 
      his lungs. Then he began CPR. Counting carefully. Deliberately. Resisting the instinct to blow too hard 
      and too fas t. For three minutes Langdon tried to revive the old man. After five minutes, Langdon 
      knew it was over.  
      Il preferito. The man who would be Pope. Lying dead before him. 
      Somehow, even now, prostrate in the shadows on the semisubmerged ledge, Cardinal Baggia retained 
      an air of quiet dignity. The water lapped softly across his chest, seeming almost remorseful... as if 
      asking forgiveness for being the man's ultimate killer... as if trying to cleanse the scalded wound that 
      bore its name.  
      Gently, Langdon ran a hand across the man's face and closed his upturned eyes. As he did, he felt an 
      exhausted shudder of tears well from within. It startled him. Then, for the first time in years, Langdon 
      cried.  
                         Angels & Demons      217  
      pollution tarnishing the original bronze. Then the significance hit him. He had seen a pair of doves 
      earlier today at the Pantheon. A pair of doves carried no meaning. This dove, however, was alone. 
      The lone dove is the pagan symbol for the Angel of Peace. The truth almost lifted Langdon the rest of 
      the way to the obelisk. Bernini had chosen the pagan symbol for the angel so he could disguise it in a 
      pagan fountain. Let angels guide you on your lofty quest. The dove is the angel! Langdon could think 
      of no more lofty perch for the Illuminati's final marker than atop this obelisk. 
      The bird was l ooking west. Langdon tried to follow its gaze, but he could not see over the buildings. 
      He climbed higher. A quote from St. Gregory of Nyssa emerged from his memory most unexpectedly. 
      As the soul becomes enlightened... it takes the beautiful shape of the dove. Langdon rose heavenward. 
      Toward the dove. He was almost flying now. He reached the platform from which the obelisk rose and 
      could climb no higher. With one look around, though, he knew he didn't have to. All of Rome spread 
      out before him. The view was stunning. To his left, the chaotic media lights surrounding St. Peter's. To 
      his right, the smoking cupola of Santa Maria della Vittoria. In front of him in the distance, Piazza del 
      Popolo. Beneath him, the fourth and final point. A giant cross of obelisks. 
      Trembling, Langdon looked to the dove overhead. He turned and faced the proper direction, and then 
      he lowered his eyes to the skyline. 
      In an instant he saw it.  
      So obvious. So clear. So deviously simple. 
      Staring at it now, Langdon could not believe the Illuminati lair had stayed hidden for so many years. 
      The entire city seemed to fade away as he looked out at the monstrous stone structure across the river 
      in front of him. The building was as famous as any in Rome. It stood on the banks of the Tiber River 
      diagonally adjacent to the Vatican. The building's geometry was stark-a circular castle, within a square 
      fortress, and then, outside its walls, surrounding the entire structure, a park in the shape of a 
      pentagram. The ancient stone ramparts before him were dramatically lit by soft floodlights. High atop 
      the castle stood the mammoth bronze angel. The angel pointed his sword downward at the exact 
      center of the castle. And as if that were not enough, leading solely and directly to the castle's main 
      entrance sto od the famous Bridge of Angels... a dramatic approachway adorned by twelve towering 
      angels carved by none other than Bernini himself. 
      In a final breathtaking revelation, Langdon realized Bernini's city-wide cross of obelisks marked the 
      fortress in perfect Illuminati fashion; the cross's central arm passed directly through the center of the 
      castle's bridge, dividing it into two equal halves. Langdon retrieved his tweed coat, holding it away from 
      his dripping body. Then he jumped into the stolen sedan and rammed his soggy shoe into the 
      accelerator, speeding off into the night. 
                         Angels & Demons      219  
      Langdon swore aloud. "Have you seen anyone go in there?" He pointed to the drawbridge. 
      "Actually, yeah. A black van's been going in and out all night." 
      Langdon felt a brick hit the bottom of his stomach. 
      "Lucky bastard," the Aussie said, gazing up at the tower, and then frowning at his obstructed view of 
      the Vatican. "I bet the view from up there is perfect. I couldn't get through the traffic in St. Peter's, so 
      I'm shooting from here." 
      Langdon wasn't listening . He was looking for options. 
      "What do you say?" the Australian said. "This 11th Hour Samaritan for real?" 
      Langdon turned. "The what?" 
      "You didn't hear? The Captain of the Swiss Guard got a call from somebody who claims to have some 
      primo info. The guy's flying in right now. All I know is if he saves the day... there go the ratings!" The 
      man laughed.  
      Langdon was suddenly confused. A good Samaritan flying in to help? Did the person somehow know 
      where the antimatter was? Then why didn't he just tell the Swiss Guard? Why was he coming in 
      person? 
      Something was odd, but Langdon didn't have time to figure out what. 
      "Hey," the Aussie said, studying Langdon more closely. "Ain't you that guy I saw on TV? Trying to 
      save that cardinal in St. Peter's Square?"  
      Langdon did not answer. His eyes had suddenly locked on a contraption attached to the top of the 
      truck-a satellite dish on a collapsible appendage. Langdon looked at the castle again. The outer rampart 
      was fifty feet tall. The inner fortress climbed farther still. A shelled defense. The top was impossibly 
      high from here, but maybe if he could clear the first wall... 
      Langdon spun to the newsman and pointed to the satellite arm. "How high does that go?" 
      "Huh?" The man looked confused. "Fifteen meters. Why?" 
      "Move the t ruck. Park next to the wall. I need help." 
      "What are you talking about?"  
      Langdon explained. 
      The Aussie's eyes went wide. "Are you insane? That's a twohundred-thousand-dollar telescoping 
      extension. Not a ladder!" 
      "You want ratings? I've got information that will make your day." Langdon was desperate. 
      "Information worth two hundred grand?" 
      Langdon told him what he would reveal in exchange for the favor. 
      Ninety seconds later, Robert Langdon was gripping the top of the satellite arm wavering in the breeze 
      fifty feet off the ground. Leaning out, he grabbed the top of the first bulwark, dragged himself onto the 
      wall, and dropped onto the castle's lower bastion. 
      "Now keep your bargain!" the Aussie called up. "Where is he?" 
      Langdon felt guilt-ridden for revealing this information, but a deal was a deal. Besides, the Hassassin 
      would probably call the press anyway. "Piazza Navona," Langdon shouted. "He's in the fountain." 
      The Aussie lowered his satellite dish and peeled out after the scoop of his career. 
       
      In a stone ch amber high above the city, the Hassassin removed his soaking boots and bandaged his 
      wounded toe. There was pain, but not so much that he couldn't enjoy himself. He turned to his prize. 
      She was in the corner of the room, on her back on a rudimentary divan, hands tied behind her, mouth 
      gagged. The Hassassin moved toward her. She was awake now. This pleased him. 
      Surprisingly, in her eyes, he saw fire instead of fear. 
      The fear will come.  
                         Angels & Demons      221  
      too late. He reached up and turned on the van's headlights. The room around him blazed into 
      existence, harsh shadows in a simple chamber. Langdon guessed the room was once used for horses 
      and ammunition. It was also a dead end. 
      No exit. I came the wrong way! 
      At the end of his rope, Langdon jumped from the van and scanned the walls around him. No 
      doorways. No gates. He thought of the angel over the tunnel entrance and wondered if it had been a 
      coincidence. No! He thought of the killer's words at the fountain. She is in the Church of 
      Illumination... awaiting my  return. 
      Langdon had come too far to fail now. His heart was pounding. Frustration and hatred were starting to 
      cripple his senses. 
      When he saw the blood on the floor, Langdon's first thought was for Vittoria. But as his eyes followed 
      the stains, he realized they were bloody footprints. The strides were long. The splotches of blood were 
      only on the left foot. The Hassassin! 
      Langdon followed the footprints toward the corner of the room, his sprawling shadow growing fainter. 
      He felt more and more puzzled with every step. The bloody prints looked as though they walked 
      directly into the corner of the room and then disappeared. 
      When Langdon arrived in the corner, he could not believe his eyes. The granite block in the floor here 
      was not a square like the others. He was looking at another signpost. The block was carved into a 
      perfect pentagram, arranged with the tip pointing into the corner. Ingeniously concealed by 
      overlapping walls, a narrow slit in the stone served as an exit. Langdon slid through. He was in a 
      passage. In front of him were the remains of a wooden barrier that had once been blocking this tunnel. 
      Beyond it there was light.  
      Langdon was running now. He clambered over the wood and headed for the light. The passage quickly 
      opened into another, larger chamber. Here a single torch flickered on the wall. Langdon was in a 
      section of the castle that had no electricity... a section no tourists would ever see. The room would 
      have been frightful in daylight, but the torch made it even more gruesome. 
      Il prigione. 
      There were a dozen tiny jail cells, the iron bars on most eroded away. One of the larger cells, however, 
      remained intact, and on the floor Langdon saw something that almost stopped his heart. Black robes 
      and red sashes on the floor. This is where he held the cardinals!  
      Near the cell was an iron doorway in the wall. The door was ajar and beyond it Langdon could see 
      some sort of passage. He ran toward it. But Langdon stopped before he got there. The trail of blood 
      did not enter the passage. When Langdon saw the words carved over the archway, he knew why. 
      Il Passetto.  
      He was stunned. He had heard of this tunnel many times, never knowing where exactly the entrance 
      was. Il Passetto-The Little Passage-was a slender, three-quarter-mile tunnel built between Castle  St. 
      Angelo and the Vatican. It had been used by various Popes to escape to safety during sieges of the 
      Vatican... as well as by a few less pious Popes to secretly visit mistresses or oversee the torture of their 
      enemies. Nowadays both ends of the tunnel were supposedly sealed with impenetrable locks whose 
      keys were kept in some Vatican vault. Langdon suddenly feared he knew how the Illuminati had been 
      moving in and out of the Vatican. He found himself wondering who on the inside had betrayed the 
      church and  coughed up the keys. 
      Olivetti? One of the Swiss Guard? None of it mattered anymore. The blood on the floor led to the 
      opposite end of the prison. Langdon followed. Here, a rusty gate hung draped with chains. The lock 
      had been removed and the gate stood ajar. Beyond the gate was a steep ascension of spiral stairs. The 
      floor here was also marked with a pentagramal block. Langdon stared at the block, trembling, 
      wondering if Bernini himself had held the chisel that had shaped these chunks. Overhead, the archway 
      was adorned with a tiny carved cherub. This was it. The trail of blood curved up the stairs. 
      Before ascending, Langdon knew he needed a weapon, any weapon. He found a four-foot section of 
      iron bar near one of the cells. It had a sharp, splintered end. Although absurdly heavy, it was the best 
      he could do. He hoped the element of surprise, combined with the Hassassin's wound, would be 
      enough to tip the scales in his advantage. Most of all, though, he hoped he was not too late. 
      The staircase's spiral treads were worn and twisted steeply upward. Langdon ascended, listening for 
                         Angels & Demons      223  
                           108 
        
       
      In the split second it took Langdon to take in his surroundings, he realized he was in a sacred place. 
      The embellishments in the oblong room, though old and faded, were replete with familiar symbology. 
      Pentagram tiles. Planet frescoes. Doves. Pyramids. The Church of Illumination. Simple and pure. He 
      had arrived. 
      Directly in front of him, framed in the opening of the balcony, stood the Hassassin. He was bare 
      chested, standing over Vittoria, who lay bound but very much alive. Langdon felt a wave of relief to see 
      her. For an instant, their eyes met, and a torrent of emotions flowed-gratitude, desperation, and regret. 
      "So we meet yet again," the Hassassin said. He looked at the bar in Langdon's hand and laughed out 
      loud. "And this time you come for me with that?" 
      "Untie her."  
      The Hassassin  put the knife to Vittoria's throat. "I will kill her." 
      Langdon had no doubt the Hassassin was capable of such an act. He forced a calm into his voice. "I 
      imagine she would welcome it... considering the alternative." 
      The Hassassin smiled at the insult. "You're right. She has much to offer. It would be a waste." 
      Langdon stepped forward, grasping the rusted bar, and aimed the splintered end directly at the 
      Hassassin.  
      The cut on his hand bit sharply. "Let her go." 
      The Hassassin seemed for a moment to be considering it. Exhaling, he dropped his shoulders. It was a 
      clear motion of surrender, and yet at that exact instant the Hassassin's arm seemed to accelerate 
      unexpectedly.  
      There was a blur of dark muscle, and a blade suddenly came tearing through the air toward Langdon's 
      chest. 
      Whether it was instinct or exhaustion that buckled Langdon's knees at that moment, he didn't know, 
      but the knife sailed past his left ear and clattered to the floor behind him. The Hassassin seemed 
      unfazed. He smiled at Langdon, who was kneeling now, holding the metal bar. The killer stepped away 
      from Vittoria and moved toward Langdon like a stalking lion. 
      As Langdon scrambled to his feet, lifting the bar again, his wet turtleneck and pants felt suddenly more 
      restrictive. The Hassassin, half-clothed, seemed to move much faster, the wound on his foot apparently 
      not slowing him at all. Langdon sensed this was a man accustomed to pain. For the first time in his life, 
      Langdon wished he were holding a very big gun.  
      The Hassassin circled slowly, as if enjoying himself, always just out of reach, moving toward the knife 
      on the floor. Langdon cut him off. Then the killer moved back toward Vittoria. 
      Again Langdon cut him off.  
      "There's still time," Langdon ventured. "Tell me where the canister is. The Vatican will pay more than 
      the Illuminati ever could."  
      "You are na��ve."  
      Langdon jabbed with the bar. The Hassassin dodged. He navigated around a bench, holding the 
      weapon in front of him, trying to corner the Hassassin in the oval room. This damn room has no 
      corners! Oddly, the Hassassin did not seem interested in attacking or fleeing. He was simply playing 
      Langdon's game. Coolly waiting. 
      Waiting for what? The killer kept circling, a master at positioning himself. It was like an endless game 
      of chess. The weapon in Langdon's hand was getting heavy, and he suddenly sensed he knew what the 
      Hassassin was waiting for. He's tiring me out. It was working, too. Langdon was hit by a surge of 
      weariness, the adrenaline alone no longer enough to keep him alert. He knew he had to make a move. 
      The Hassassin seemed to read Langdon's mind, shifting again, as if intentionally leading Langdon 
      toward a table in the middle of the room. Langdon could tell there was something on the table. 
      Something glinted in the torchlight. A weapon? Langdon kept his eyes focused on the Hassassin and 
      maneuvered himself closer to the table. When the Hassassin cast a long, guileless glance at the table, 
                         Angels & Demons      225  
      The camerlegno. 
      Camerlegno Ventresca was the one man who had been a beacon of hope for the world through this 
      entire tribulation. The camerlegno had done more to condemn the Illuminati tonight than decades of 
      conspiracy theorists. Apparently he would pay the price. He was the Illuminati's final target. 
      "You'll never get to him," Langdon challenged. 
      "Not I," the Hassassin replied, forcing Langdon farther back around the wall. 
      "That honor is reserved for Janus himself." 
      "The Illuminati leader himself intends to brand the camerlegno?" 
      "Power has its privileges."  
      "But no one could possibly get into Vatican City right now!" 
      The Hassassin looked smug. "Not unless he had an appointment." 
      Langdon was confused. The only person expected at the Vatican right now was the person the press 
      was calling the 11th Hour Samaritan -the person Rocher said had information that could save- 
      Langdon stopped short. Good God! 
      The Hassassin smirked, clearly enjoying Langdon's sickening cognition. "I too wondered how Janus 
      would gain entrance. Then in the van I heard the radio-a report about an 11th hour Samaritan." He 
      smiled. "The Vatican will welcome Janus with open arms." 
      Langdon almost stumbled backward. Janus is the Samaritan! It was an unthinkable deception. The 
      Illuminati leader would get a royal escort directly to the camerlegno's chambers. But how did Janus fool 
      Rocher? Or was Rocher somehow involved? Langdon felt a chill. Ever since he had almost suffocated 
      in the secret archives, Langdon had not entirely trusted Rocher.  
      The Hassassin jabbed suddenly, nicking Langdon in the side.  
      Langdon jumped back, his temper flaring. "Janus will never get out alive!" 
      The Hassassin shrugged. "Some causes are worth dying for." 
      Langdon sensed the killer was serious. Janus coming to Vatican City on a suicide mission? A question 
      of honor? For an instant, Langdon's mind took in the entire terrifying cycle. The Illuminati plot had 
      come full circle. The priest whom the Illuminati had inadvertently brought to power by killing the Pope 
      had emerged as a worthy adversary. In a final act of defiance, the Illuminati leader would destroy him. 
      Suddenly, Langdon felt the wall behind him disappear. There was a rush of cool air, and he staggered 
      backward into the night. The balcony! He now realized what the Hassassin had in mind. 
      Langdon immediate ly sensed the precipice behind him-a hundred-foot drop to the courtyard below. 
      He had seen it on his way in. The Hassassin wasted no time. With a violent surge, he lunged. The spear 
      sliced toward Langdon's midsection. Langdon skidded back, and the point came up short, catching 
      only his shirt. Again the point came at him. Langdon slid farther back, feeling the banister right behind 
      him. Certain the next jab would kill him, Langdon attempted the absurd. Spinning to one side, he 
      reached out and grabbed the shaft, sending a jolt of pain through his palm. Langdon held on. 
      The Hassassin seemed unfazed. They strained for a moment against one another, face to face, the 
      Hassassin's breath fetid in Langdon's nostrils. The bar began to slip. The Hassassin was too strong. In 
      a final act of desperation, Langdon stretched out his leg, dangerously off balance as he tried to ram his 
      foot down on the Hassassin's injured toe. But the man was a professional and adjusted to protect his 
      weakness.  
      Langdon had just played his final card. And he knew he had lost the hand. The Hassassin's arms 
      exploded upward, driving Langdon back against the railing. Langdon sensed nothing but empty space 
      behind him as the railing hit just beneath his buttocks. The Hassassin held the bar crosswise and drove 
      it into Langdon's chest. Langdon's back arched over the chasm. 
      "Ma'assalamah," the Hassassin sneered. "Good-bye." 
      With a merciless glare, the Hassassin gave a final shove. Langdon's center of gravity shifted, and his 
      feet swung up off the floor. With only one hope of survival, Langdon grabbed on to the railing as he 
      went over. His left hand slipped, but his right hand held on. He ended up hanging upside down by his 
      legs and one hand... straining to hold on. 
      Looming over him, the Hassassin raised the bar overhead, preparing to bring it crashing down. As the 
      bar began to accelerate, Langdon saw a vision. Perhaps it was the imminence of death or simply blind 
                         Angels & Demons      227  
                           109 
        
       
      Meanwhile, in St. Peter's Square, the wall of Swiss Guards yelled orders and fanned outward, trying to 
      push the crowds back to a safer distance. It was no use. The crowd was too dense and seemed far more 
      interested in the Vatican's impending doom than in their own safety. The towering media screens in 
      the square were now transmitting a live countdown of the antimatter canister-a direct feed from the 
      Swiss Guard security monitor-compliments of the camerlegno. Unfortunately, the image of the canister 
      counting down was doing nothing to repel the crowds. The people in the square apparently looked at 
      the tiny droplet of liquid suspended in the canister and decided it was not as menacing as they had 
      thought. They could also see the countdown clock now-a little under forty-five minutes until  
      etonation.  
      Plenty of time to stay and watch. 
      Nonetheless, the Swiss Guards unanimously agreed that the camerlegno's bold decision to address the 
      world with the truth and then provide the media with actual visuals of Illuminati treachery had been a 
      savvy maneuver. The Illuminati had no doubt expected the Vatican to be their usual reticent selves in 
      the face of adversity. Not tonight. Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca had proven himself a commanding foe. 
      Inside the Sistine Chapel, Cardinal Mortati was getting restless. It was past 11:15 P.M. Many of the 
      cardinals were continuing to pray, but others had clustered around the exit, clearly unsettled by the 
      hour. 
      Some of the cardinals began pounding on the door with their fists. Outside the door Lieutenant 
      Chartrand heard the pounding and didn't know what to do. He checked his watch. It was time. Captain 
      Rocher had given strict orders that the cardinals were not to be let out until he gave the word. The 
      pounding on the door became more intense, and Chartrand felt uneasy. He wondered if the captain 
      had simply forgotten. The captain had been acting very erratic since his mysterious phone call. 
      Chartrand pulled out his walkie-talkie. "Captain? Chartrand here. It is past time. Should I open the 
      Sistine?" 
      "That door stays shut. I believe I already gave you that order." 
      "Yes, sir, I just -" 
      "Our guest is arriving shortly. Take a few men upstairs, and guard the door of the Pope's office. The 
      camerlegno is not to go anywhere." 
      "I'm sorry, sir?"  
      "What is it that you don't understand, Lieutenant?" 
      "Nothing, sir. I am on my way." 
      Upstairs in the Office of the Pope, the camerlegno stared in quiet meditation at the fire. Give me 
      strength, God. Bring us a miracle. He poked at the coals, wondering if he would survive the night. 
                         Angels & Demons      229  
      "Talk about an entrance," Vittoria said. Against the white marble, she could see a tiny speck of a 
      person emerge from the Vatican and move toward the chopper. She would never have recognized the 
      figure except for the bright red beret on his head. "Red carpet greeting. That's Rocher." 
      Langdon pounded his fist on the banister. "Somebody's got to warn them!" He turned to go. 
      Vittoria caught his arm. "Wait!" She had just seen something else, something her eyes refused to 
      believe.  
      Fingers trembl ing, she pointed toward the chopper. Even from this distance, there was no mistaking. 
      Descending the gangplank was another figure... a figure who moved so uniquely that it could only be 
      one man. Although the figure was seated, he accelerated across the open square with effortless control 
      and startling speed.  
      A king on an electric throne. 
      It was Maximilian Kohler. 
                         Angels & Demons      231  
      But Max knew his mother's reply before she even said it. "Gott wird ihn beschuetzen." 
      Yes, Max thought. God will protect me. The conviction in his mother's voice gave him strength. God 
      will protect me.  
      An hour later, Max felt like his whole body was being crushed beneath a car. He could not even  
      breathe to cry.  
      "Your son is in great suffering," another doctor said. "Let me at least ease his pain. I have in my bag a 
      simple injection of -" 
      "Ruhe, bitte!" Max's father silenced the doctor without ever opening his eyes. He simply kept praying. 
      "Father, please!" Max wanted to scream. "Let them stop the pain!" But his words were lost in a spasm 
      of coughing.  
      An hour later, the pain had worsened. 
      "Your son could become paralyzed," one of the doctors scolded. "Or even die! We have medicines that 
      will help!" 
      Frau and Herr Kohler would not allow it. They did not believe in medicine. Who were they to interfere 
      with God's master plan? They prayed harder. After all, God had blessed them with this boy, why would 
      God take the child away? His mother whispered to Max to be strong. She explained that God was 
      testing him... like the Bible story of Abraham... a test of his faith. 
      Max tried to have faith, but the pain was excruciating. 
      "I cannot watch this!" one of the doctors finally said, running from the room. 
      By dawn, Max was barely conscious. Every muscle in his body spasmed in agony. Where is Jesus? he 
      wondered. Doesn't he love me? Max felt the life slipping from his body. His mother had fallen asleep 
      at the bedside, her hands still clasped over him. Max's father stood across the room at the window 
      staring out at the dawn. He seemed to be in a trance. Max could hear the low mumble of his ceaseless 
      prayers for mercy. 
      It was then that Max sensed the figure hovering over him. An angel? Max could barely see. His eyes 
      were swollen shut. The figure whispered in his ear, but it was not the voice of an angel. Max 
      recognized it as one of the doctors... the one who had sat in the corner for two days, never leaving, 
      begging Max's parents to let him administer some new drug from England. 
      "I will never forgive myself," the doctor whispered, "if I do not do this." Then the doctor gently took 
      Max's frail arm. "I wish I had done it sooner." 
      Max felt a tiny prick in his arm -barely discernible through the pain. 
      Then the doctor quietly packed his things. Before he left, he put a hand on Max's forehead. "This will 
      save your l ife. I have great faith in the power of medicine." 
      Within minutes, Max felt as if some sort of magic spirit were flowing through his veins. The warmth 
      spread through his body numbing his pain. Finally, for the first time in days, Max slept. 
      When the fever broke, his mother and father proclaimed a miracle of God. But when it became evident 
      that their son was crippled, they became despondent. They wheeled their son into the church and 
      begged the priest for counseling. 
      "It was only by the grace of God," the priest told them, "that this boy survived." 
      Max listened, saying nothing. 
      "But our son cannot walk!" Frau Kohler was weeping. 
      The priest nodded sadly. "Yes. It seems God has punished him for not having enough faith." 
      "Mr. Kohler?" It was the Swiss Guard who had run ahead. "The camerlegno says he will grant you 
      audience."  
      Kohler grunted, accelerating again down the hall.  
      "He is surprised by your visit," the guard said. 
      "I'm sure." Kohler rolled on. "I would like to see him alone." 
      "Impossible," the guard said. "No one -" 
      "Lieutenant," Rocher barked. "The meeting will be as Mr. Kohler wishes." 
      The guard stared in obvious disbelief. 
      Outside the door to the Pope's office, Rocher allowed his guards to take standard precautions before 
      letting Kohler in. Their handheld metal detector was rendered worthless by the myriad of electronic 
                         Angels & Demons      233  
                           112 
        
       
      All the while, the narrow tunnel called Il Passetto stretched out before Langdon and Vittoria as they 
      dashed toward Vatican City. The torch in Langdon's hand threw only enough light to see a few yards 
      ahead. The walls were close on either side, and the ceiling low. The air smelled dank. Langdon raced on 
      into the darkness with Vittoria close at his heels. 
      The tunnel inclined steeply as it left the Castle St. Angelo, proceeding upward into the underside of a 
      stone bastion that looked like a Roman aqueduct. There, the tunnel leveled out and began its secret 
      course toward Vatican City.  
      As Langdon ran, his thoughts turned over and over in a kaleidoscope of confounding images-Kohler, 
      Janus, the Hassassin, Rocher... a sixth brand? I'm sure you've heard about the sixth brand, the killer had 
      said. The most brilliant of all. Langdon was quite certain he had not. Even in conspiracy theory lore, 
      Langdon could think of no references to any sixth brand. Real or imagined. There were rumors of a 
      gold bullion and a flawless Illuminati Diamond but never any mention of a sixth brand.  
      "Kohler can't be Janus!" Vittoria declared as they ran down the interior of the dike. "It's impossible!" 
      Impossible was one word Langdon had stopped using tonight. "I don't know," 
      Langdon yelled as they ran. 
      "Kohler has a serious grudge, and he also has some serious influence." 
      "This crisis has made CERN look like monsters! Max would never do anything to damage CERN's 
      reputation!" 
      On one count, Langdon knew CERN had taken a public beating tonight, all because of the Illuminati's 
      insistence on making this a public spectacle. And yet, he wondered how much CERN had really been 
      damaged. Criticism from the church was nothing new for CERN. In fact, the more Langdon thought 
      about it, the more he wondered if this crisis might actually benefit CERN. If publicity were the game, 
      then antimatter was the jackpot winner tonight. The entire planet was talking about it. 
      "You know what promoter P. T. Barnum said," Langdon called over his shoulder. " 
      'I don't care what you say about me, just spell my name right!' I bet people are already secretly lining up 
      to license antimatter technology. And after they see its true power at midnight tonight..."  
      "Illogical," Vittoria said. "Publicizing scientific breakthroughs is not about showing destructive power!  
      This is terrible for antimatter, trust me!" 
      Langdon's torch was fading now. "Then maybe it's all much simpler than that. Maybe Kohler gambled 
      that the Vatican would keep the antimatter a secret-refusing to empower the Illuminati by confirming 
      the weapon's existence. Kohler expected the Vatican to be their usual tight-lipped selves about the 
      threat, but the camerlegno changed the rules." 
      Vittoria was silent as they dashed down the tunnel. Suddenly the scenario was making more sense to 
      Langdon.   
      "Yes! Kohler never counted on the camerlegno's reaction. The camerlegno broke the Vatican tradition 
      of secrecy and went public about the crisis. He was dead honest. He put the antimatter on TV, for 
      God's sake. It was a brilliant response, and Kohler never expected it. And the irony of the whole thing 
      is that the Illuminati attack backfired. It inadvertently produced a new church leader in the camerlegno. 
      And now Kohler is coming to kill him!"  
      "Max is a bastard," Vittoria declared, "but he is not a murderer. And he would never have been 
      involved in my father's assassination." 
      In Langdon's mind, it was Kohler's voice that answered. Leonardo was considered dangerous by many 
      purists at CERN.Fusing science and God is the ultimate scientific blasphemy. 
      "Maybe Kohler found out about the antimatter project weeks ago and didn't like the religious 
      implications." 
      "So he killed my father over it? Ridiculous! Besides, Max Kohler would never have known the project 
      existed."  
      "While you were gone, maybe your father broke down and consulted Kohler, asking for guidance. You 
                         Angels & Demons      235  
                           113 
        
       
      Something was wrong. 
      Lieutenant Chartrand stood outside the Pope's office and sensed in the uneasy stance of the soldier 
      standing with him that they shared the same anxiety. The private meeting they were shielding, Rocher 
      had said, could save the Vatican from destruction. So Chartrand wondered why his protective instincts 
      were tingling. 
      And why was Rocher acting so strangely? 
      Something definitely was awry. 
      Captain Rocher stood to Chartrand's right, staring dead ahead, his sharp gaze uncharacteristically 
      distant. Chartrand barely recognized the captain. Rocher had not been himself in the last hour. His 
      decisions made no sense. 
      Someone should be present inside this meeting! Chartrand thought. He had heard Maximilian Kohler 
      bolt the door after he entered. Why had Rocher permitted this? 
      But there was so much more bothering Chartrand. The cardinals. The cardinals were still locked in the 
      Sistine Chapel. This was absolute insanity. The camerlegno had wanted them evacuated fifteen minutes 
      ago! Rocher had overruled the decision and not informed the camerlegno. 
      Chartrand had expressed concern, and Rocher had almost taken off his head. Chain of command was 
      never questioned in the Swiss Guard, and Rocher was now top dog. 
      Half an hour, Rocher thought, discreetly checking his Swiss chronometer in the dim light of the 
      candelabra lighting the hall. Please hurry. 
      Chartrand wished he could hear what was happening on the other side of the doors. Still, he knew 
      there was no one he would rather have handling this crisis than the camerlegno. The man had been 
      tested beyond reason tonight, and he had not flinched. He had confronted the problem head-on... 
      truthful, candid, shining like an example to all. Chartrand felt proud right now to be a Catholic. 
      The Illuminati had made a mistake when they challenged Camerlegno Ventresca.  
      At that moment, however, Chartrand's thoughts were jolted by an unexpected sound. A banging. It 
      was coming from down the hall. The pounding was distant and muffled, but incessant. 
      Rocher looked up. The captain turned to Chartrand and motioned down the hall. Chartrand 
      understood. He turned on his flashlight and took off to investigate. 
      The banging was more desperate now. Chartrand ran thirty yards down the corridor to an intersection. 
      The noise seemed to be coming from around the corner, beyond the Sala Clementina. 
      Chartrand felt perplexed.  
      There was only one room back there-the Pope's private library. His Holiness's private library had been 
      locked since the Pope's death. Nobody could possibly be in there! Chartrand hurried down the second 
      corridor, turned another corner, and rushed to the library door. The wooden portico was diminutive, 
      but it stood in the dark like a dour sentinel. 
      The banging was coming from somewhere inside. Chartrand hesitated. He had never been inside the 
      private library. Few had. No one was allowed in without an escort by the Pope himself. Tentatively, 
      Chartrand reached for the doorknob and turned. As he had imagined, the door was locked. He put his 
      ear to the door. The banging was louder. Then he heard something else. Voices! Someone calling 
      out! He could not make out the words, but he could hear the panic in their shouts. Was someone 
      trapped in the library? Had the Swiss Guard not properly evacuated the building? Chartrand hesitated, 
      wondering if he should go back and consult Rocher. The hell with that. Chartrand had been trained to 
      make decisions, and he would make one now. He pulled out his side arm and fired a single shot into 
      the door latch. The wood exploded, and the door swung open. 
      Beyond the threshold Chartrand saw nothing but blackness. He shone his flashlight. The room was 
      rectangular-oriental carpets, high  oak shelves packed with books, a stitched leather couch, and a marble 
      fireplace. Chartrand had heard stories of this place-three thousand ancient volumes side by side with 
      hundreds of current magazines and periodicals, anything His Holiness requested.

                           114 
        
       
      The confrontation lasted only seconds. 
      Camerlegno Ventresca was still screaming when Chartrand stepped past Rocher and blew open the 
      door of the Pope's office. The guards dashed in. Langdon and Vittoria ran in behind them. 
      The scene before them was staggering. 
      The chamber was lit only by candlelight and a dying fire. Kohler was near the fireplace, standing 
      awkwardly in front of his wheelchair. He brandished a pistol, aimed at the camerlegno, who lay on the 
      floor at his feet, writhing in agony. The camerlegno's cassock was torn open, and his bare chest was 
      seared black. Langdon could not make out the symbol from across the room, but a large, square brand 
      lay on the floor near Kohler. The metal still glowed red. 
      Two of the Swiss Guards acted without hesitation. They opened fire. The bullets smashed into 
      Kohler's chest, driving him backward. Kohler collapsed into his wheelchair, his chest gurgling blood. 
      His gun went skittering across the floor. 
      Langdon stood stunned in the doorway. 
      Vittoria seemed paralyzed. "Max..." she whispered. 
      The camerlegno, still twisting on the floor, rolled toward Rocher, and with the trancelike terror of the 
      early witch hunts, pointed his index finger at Rocher and yelled a single word. 
      "ILLUMINATUS!"  
      "You bastard," Rocher said, running at him. "You sanctimonious bas-" 
      This time it was Chartrand who reacted on instinct, putting three bullets in Rocher's back. The captain 
      fell face first on the tile floor and slid lifeless through his own blood. Chartrand and the guards dashed 
      immediately to the camerlegno, who lay clutching himself, convulsing in pain. 
      Both guards let out exclamations of horror when they saw the symbol seared on the camerlegno's 
      chest. The second guard saw the brand upside down and immediately staggered backward with fear in 
      his eyes.  
      Chartrand, looking equally overwhelmed by the symbol, pulled the camerlegno's torn cassock up over 
      the burn, shielding it from view. 
      Langdon felt delirious as he moved across the room. Through a mist of insanity and violence, he tried 
      to make sense of what he was seeing. A crippled scientist, in a final act of symbolic dominance, had 
      flown into Vatican City and branded the church's highest official. Some things are worth dying for, the 
      Hassassin had said. Langdon wondered how a handicapped man could possibly have overpowered the 
      camerlegno.  
      Then again, Kohler had a gun. It doesn't matter how he did it! Kohler accomplished his mission! 
      Langdon moved toward the gruesome scene. The camerlegno was being attended, and Langdon felt 
      himself drawn toward the smoking brand on the floor near Kohler's wheelchair. The sixth brand? The 
      closer Langdon got, the more confused he became. The brand seemed to be a perfect square, quite 
      large, and had obviously come from the sacred center compartment of the chest in the Illuminati Lair. 
      A sixth and final brand, the Hassassin had said. The most brilliant of all. 
      Langdon knelt beside Kohler and reached for the object. The metal still radiated heat. Grasping the 
      wooden handle, Langdon picked it up. He was not sure what he expected to see, but it most certainly 
      was not this.  
      Langdon stared a long, confused moment. Nothing was making sense. Why had the guards cried out in 
      horror when they saw this? It was a square of meaningless squiggles. The most brilliant of all? It was 
      symmetrical, Langdon could tell as he rotated it in his hand, but it was gibberish. 
      When he felt a hand on his shoulder, Langdon looked up, expecting Vittoria. The hand, however, was 
      covered with blood. It belonged to Maximilian Kohler, who was reaching out from his wheelchair. 
      Langdon dropped the brand and staggered to his feet. Kohler's still alive! 
      Slumped in his wheelchair, the dying director was still breathing, albeit barely, sucking in sputtering 
      gasps. Kohler's eyes met Langdon's, and it was the same stony gaze that had greeted Langdon at 
      CERN earlier that day. The eyes looked even harder in death, the loathing and enmity rising to the 
                         Angels & Demons      239  
                           115 
        
       
      In St. Peter's Square, the Swiss Guard pilot sat in the cockpit of the parked Vatican helicopter and 
      rubbed his temples. The chaos in the square around him was so loud that it drowned out the sound of 
      his idling rotors. This was no solemn candlelight vigil. He was amazed a riot had not broken out yet. 
      With less than twenty-five minutes left until midnight, the people were still packed together, some 
      praying, some weeping for the church, others screaming obscenities and proclaiming that this was what 
      the church deserved, still others chanting apocalyptic Bible verses. 
      The pilot's head pounded as the media lights glinted off his windshield. He squinted out at the 
      clamorous masses. Banners waved over the crowd. 
      ANTIMATTER IS THE ANTICHRIST!  
      SCIENTIST=SATANIST 
      WHERE IS YOUR GOD NOW? 
      The pilot groaned, his headache worsening. He half considered grabbing the windshield's vinyl 
      covering and putting it up so he wouldn't have to watch, but he knew he would be airborne in a matter 
      of minutes.  
      Lieutenant Chartrand had just radioed with terrible news. The camerlegno had been attacked by 
      Maximilian Kohler and seriously injured. Chartrand, the American, and the woman were carrying the 
      camerlegno out now so he could be evacuated to a hospital. 
      The pilot felt personally responsible for the attack. He reprimanded himself for not acting on his gut. 
      Earlier, when he had picked up Kohler at the airport, he had sensed something in the scientist's dead 
      eyes. He couldn't place it, but he didn't like it. Not that it mattered. Rocher was running the show, and 
      Rocher insisted this was the guy. Rocher had apparently been wrong. 
      A new clamor arose from the crowd, and the pilot looked over to see a line of cardinals processing 
      solemnly out of the Vatican onto St. Peter's Square. The cardinals' relief to be leaving ground zero 
      seemed to be quickly overcome by looks of bewilderment at the spectacle now going on outside the 
      church. 
      The crowd noise intensified yet again. The pilot's head pounded. He needed an aspirin. Maybe three. 
      He didn't like to fly on medication, but a few aspirin would certainly be less debilitating than this raging 
      headache. He reached for the first-aid kit, kept with assorted maps and manuals in a cargo box bolted 
      between the two front seats. When he tried to open the box, though, he found it locked. He looked 
      around for the key and then finally gave up. Tonight was clearly not his lucky night. 
      He went back to massaging his temples. 
      Inside the darkened basilica, Langdon, Vittoria, and the two guards strained breathlessly toward the 
      main exit. Unable to find anything more suitable, the four of them were transporting the wounded 
      camerlegno on a narrow table, balancing the inert body between them as though on a stretcher. 
      Outside the doors, the faint roar of human chaos was now audible. The camerlegno teetered on the 
      brink of unconsciousness. 
      Time was running out. 
                         Angels & Demons      241  
      also forgotten that iron brands, just like rubber stamps, never looked like their imprints. They were in 
      reverse. Langdon had been looking at the brand's negative! As the chaos grew, an old Illuminati quote 
      echoed with new meaning: "A flawless diamond, born of the ancient elements with such perfection 
      that all those who saw it could only stare in wonder." 
      Langdon knew now the myth was true. Earth, Air, Fire, Water. 
      The Illuminati Diamond.  
                         Angels & Demons      243  
                           118 
        
       
      Eleven-forty-two P.M.  
      The frenzied convoy that plunged back into the basilica to retrieve the camerlegno was not one 
      Langdon had ever imagined he would be part of... much less leading. But he had been closest to the 
      door and had acted on instinct.  
      He'll die in here, Langdon thought, sprinting over the threshold into the darkened void. "Camerlegno! 
      Stop!" 
      The wall of blackness that hit Langdon was absolute. His pupils were contracted from the glare 
      outside, and his field of vision now extended no farther than a few feet before his face. He skidded to a 
      stop. 
      Somewhere in the blackness ahead, he heard the camerlegno's cassock rustle as the priest ran blindly 
      into the abyss.  
      Vittoria and the guards arrived immediately. Flashlights came on, but the lights were almost dead now 
      and did not even begin to probe the depths of the basilica before them. The beams swept back and 
      forth, revealing only columns and bare floor. The camerlegno was nowhere to be seen.  
      "Camerlegno!" Chartrand yelled, fear in his voice. "Wait! Signore!" 
      A commotion in the doorway behind them caused everyone to turn. Chinita Macri's large frame 
      lurched through the entry. Her camera was shouldered, and the glowing red light on top revealed that it 
      was still transmitting. Glick was running behind her, microphone in hand, yelling for her to slow down. 
      Langdon could not believe these two. This is not the time! "Out!" Chartrand snapped. "This is not for 
      your eyes!"  
      But Macri and Glick kept coming. 
      "Chinita!" Glick sounded fearful now. "This is suicide! I'm not coming!" 
      Macri ignored him. She threw a switch on her camera. The spotlight on top glared to life, blinding 
      everyone. Langdon shielded his face and turned away in pain. Damn it! When he looked up, though, 
      the church around them was illuminated for thirty yards. At that moment the camerlegno's voice 
      echoed somewhere in the distance. "Upon this rock I will build my church!" 
      Macri wheeled her camera toward the sound. Far off, in the grayness at the end of the spotlight's reach, 
      black fabric billowed, revealing a familiar form running down the main aisle of the basilica. 
      There was a fleeting instant of hesitation as everyone's eyes took in the bizarre image. Then the dam 
      broke. Chartrand pushed past Langdon and sprinted after the camerlegno. Langdon took off next. 
      Then the guards and Vittoria. Macri brought up the rear, lighting everyone's way and transmitting the 
      sepulchral chase to the world. An unwilling Glick cursed aloud as he tagged along, fumbling through a 
      terrified blow-by-blow commentary. 
      The main aisle of St. Peter's Basilica, Lieutenant Chartrand had once figured out, was longer than an 
      Olympic soccer field. Tonight, however, it felt like twice that. As the guard sprinted after the 
      camerlegno, he wondered where the man was headed. The camerlegno was clearly in shock, 
      delirious no doubt from his physical trauma and bearing witness to the horrific massacre in the Pope's 
      office.  
      Somewhere up ahead, beyond the reach of the BBC spotlight, the camerlegno's voice rang out 
      joyously. 
      "Upon this rock I will build my church!" 
      Chartrand knew the man was shouting Scripture -Matthew 16:18, if Chartrand recalled correctly. Upon 
      this rock I will build my church. It was an almost cruelly inapt inspiration-the church was about to be 
      destroyed. Surely the camerlegno had gone mad. 
      Or had he? 
      For a fleeting instant, Chartrand's soul fluttered. Holy visions and divine messages had always seemed 
      like wishful delusions to him-the product of overzealous minds hearing what they wanted to hear-God 
      did not interact directly! 
                         Angels & Demons      245  
      words spoken by Jesus when he chose Peter as his first apostle. What did they have to do with 
      anything? 
      Macri moved in for a closer shot. Glick was mute, as if shell-shocked.  
      The camerlegno spoke quickly now. "The Illuminati have placed their tool of destruction on the very 
      cornerstone of this church. At the foundation." He motioned down the stairs. "On the very rock upon 
      which this church was built. And I know where that rock is." 
      Langdon was certain the time had come to overpower the camerlegno and carry him off. As lucid as he 
      seemed, the priest was talking nonsense. A rock? The cornerstone in the foundation? The stairway 
      before them didn't lead to the foundation, it led to the necropolis! "The quote is a metaphor, Father! 
      There is no actual rock!" 
      The camerlegno looked strangely sad. "There is a rock, my son." He pointed into the hole. "Pietro �� la 
      pietra." 
      Langdon froze. In an instant it all came clear. 
      The austere simplicity of it gave him chills. As Langdon stood there with the others, staring down the 
      long staircase, he realized that there was indeed a rock buried in the darkness beneath this church. 
      Pietro �� la pietra. Peter is the rock. Peter's faith in God was so steadfast that Jesus called Peter "the 
      rock"-the unwavering disciple on whose shoulders Jesus would build his church. On this very location, 
      Langdon realized-Vatican Hill-Peter had been crucified and buried. The early Christians built a small 
      shrine over his tomb. As Christianity spread, the shrine got bigger, layer upon layer, culminating in this 
      colossal basilica.  
      The entire Catholic faith had been built, quite literally, upon St. Peter. The rock. 
      "The antimatter is on St. Peter's tomb," the camerlegno said, his voice crystalline. 
      Despite the seemingly supernatural origin of the information, Langdon sensed a stark logic in it. 
      Placing the antimatter on St. Peter's t omb seemed painfully obvious now. The Illuminati, in an act of 
      symbolic defiance, had located the antimatter at the core of Christendom, both literally and figuratively. 
      The ultimate infiltration. 
      "And if you all need worldly proof," the camerlegno said, sounding impatient now, "I just found that 
      grate unlocked." He pointed to the open bulkhead in the floor. "It is never unlocked. Someone has 
      been down there... recently." 
      Everyone stared into the hole. 
      An instant later, with deceptive agility, the camerlegno spun, grabbed an oil lamp, and headed for the 
      opening.   
                         Angels & Demons      247  
      "Aha!" Vetra exclaimed. "And yet remarkable solutions to seemingly impossible problems often occur 
      in these moments of clarity. It's what gurus call higher consciousness. Biologists call it altered states. 
      Psychologists call it super-sentience." He paused. "And Christians call it answered prayer." Smiling 
      broadly, he added, "Sometimes, divine revelation simply means adjusting your brain to hear what your 
      heart already knows." 
      Now, as she dashed down, headlong into the dark, Vittoria sensed perhaps her father was right. Was it 
      so hard to believe that the camerlegno's trauma had put his mind in a state where he had simply 
      "realized" the antimatter's location? 
      Each of us is a God, Buddha had said. Each of us knows all. We need only open our minds to hear our 
      own wisdom.  
      It was in that moment of clarity, as Vittoria plunged deeper into the earth, that she felt her own mind 
      open... her own wisdom surface. She sensed now without a doubt what the camerlegno's intentions 
      were. Her awareness brought with it a fear like nothing she had ever known. 
      "Camerlegno, no!" she shouted down the passage. "You don't understand!" Vittoria pictured the 
      multitudes of people surrounding Vatican City, and her blood ran cold. "If you bring the antimatter 
      up... everyone will die!" 
      Langdon was leaping three steps at a time now, gaining ground. The passage was cramped, but he felt 
      no claustrophobia. His once debilitating fear was overshadowed by a far deeper dread. 
      "Camerlegno!" Langdon felt himself closing the gap on the lantern's glow. "You must leave the 
      antimatter where it is! There's no other choice!" 
      Even as Lan gdon spoke the words, he could not believe them. Not only had he accepted the 
      camerlegno's divine revelation of the antimatter's location, but he was lobbying for the destruction of 
      St. Peter's Basilica-one of the greatest architectural feats on earth... as well as all of the art inside. 
      But the people outside... it's the only way. 
      It seemed a cruel irony that the only way to save the people now was to destroy the church. Langdon 
      figured the Illuminati were amused by the symbolism. The air coming up from the bottom of the 
      tunnel was cool and dank. Somewhere down here was the sacred necropolis... burial place of St. Peter 
      and countless other early Christians. 
      Langdon felt a chill, hoping this was not a suicide mission. 
      Suddenly, the camerlegno's lantern seemed to halt. Langdon closed on him fast. 
      The end of the stairs loomed abruptly from out of the shadows. A wrought-iron gate with three 
      embossed skulls blocked the bottom of the stairs. The camerlegno was there, pulling the gate open. 
      Langdon leapt, pushing the gate shut, blocking the camerlegno's way. The others came thundering 
      down the stairs, everyone ghostly white in the BBC spotlight... especially Glick, who was looking more 
      pasty with every step. 
      Chartrand grabbed Langdon. "Let the camerlegno pass!" 
      "No!" Vittoria said from above, breathless. "We must evacuate right now! You cannot take the 
      antimatter out of here! If you bring it up, everyone outside will die!"  
      The camerlegno's voice was remarkably calm. "All of you... we must trust. We have little time." 
      "You don't understand," Vittoria said. "An explosion at ground level will be much worse than one 
      down here!"  
      The camerlegno looked at her, his green eyes resplendently sane. "Who said anything about an 
      explosion at ground level?" 
      Vittoria stared. "You're leaving it down here?"  
      The camerlegno's certitude was hypnotic. "There will be no more death tonight." 
      "Father, but -" 
      "Please... some faith." The camerlegno's voice plunged to a compelling hush. 
      "I am not asking anyone to join me. You are all free to go. All I am asking is that you not interfere with 
      His bidding. Let me do what I have been called to do." The camerlegno's stare intensified. "I am to  
      save this church. And I can. I swear on my life." 
      The silence that followed might as well have been thunder. 
                         Angels & Demons      249  
      emerged over the crest, he felt reborn. He staggered onto the flat piece of earth where he had stood 
      many times. Here the path ended. The necropolis came to an abrupt halt at a wall of earth. A tiny 
      marker read:   
      Mausoleum S. 
      La tomba di San Pietro.  
      Before him, at waist level, was an opening in the wall. There was no gilded plaque here. No fanfare. 
      Just a simple hole in the wall, beyond which lay a small grotto and a meager, crumbling sarcophagus. 
      The camerlegno gazed into the hole and smiled in exhaustion. He could hear the others coming up the 
      hill behind him. He set down his oil lamp and knelt to pray. Thank you, God. It is almost over. 
      Outside in the square, surrounded by astounded cardinals, Cardinal Mortati stared up at the media 
      screen and watched the drama unfold in the crypt below. He no longer knew what to believe. Had the 
      entire world just witnessed what he had seen? Had God truly spoken to the camerlegno? Was the 
      antimatter really going to appear on St. Peter's-  
      "Look!" A gasp went up from the throngs. 
      "There!" Everyone was suddenly pointing at the screen. "It's a miracle!" 
      Mortati looked up. The camera angle was unsteady, but it was clear enough. The image was 
      unforgettable.  
      Filmed from behind, the camerlegno was kneeling in prayer on the earthen floor. In front of him was a 
      rough-hewn hole in the wall. Inside the hollow, among the rubble of ancient stone, was a terra cotta 
      casket. Although Mortati had seen the coffin only once in his life, he knew beyond a doubt what it 
      contained.  
      San Pietro. 
      Mortati was not na��ve enough to think that the shouts of joy and amazement now thundering through 
      the crowd were exaltations from bearing witness to one of Christianity's most sacred relics. St. Peter's 
      tomb was not what had people falling to their knees in spontaneous prayer and thanksgiving. It was the 
      object on top of his tomb. 
      The antimatter canister. It was there... where it had been all day... hiding in the darkness of the 
      Necropolis. Sleek. Relentless. Deadly. The camerlegno's revelation was correct. Mortati stared in 
      wonder at the transparent cylinder. The globule of liquid still hovered at its core. The grotto around the 
      canister blinked red as the LED counted down into its final five minutes of life. 
      Also sitting on the tomb, inches away from the canister, was the wireless Swiss Guard security camera 
      that had been pointed at the canister and transmitting all along. 
      Mortati crossed himself, certain this was the most frightful image he had seen in his entire life. He 
      realized, a moment later, however, that it was about to get worse. 
      The camerlegno stood suddenly. He grabbed the antimatter in his hands and wheeled toward the 
      others. His face showing total focus. He pushed past the others and began descending the Necropolis 
      the way he had come, running down the hill. The camera caught Vittoria Vetra, frozen in terror. 
      "Where are you going! Camerlegno! I thought you said-" 
      "Have faith!" he exclaimed as he ran off. 
      Vittoria spun toward Langdon. "What do we do?" 
      Robert Langdon tried to stop the camerlegno, but Chartrand was running interference now, apparently 
      trusting the camerlegno's conviction. 
      The picture coming from the BBC camera was like a roller coaster ride now, winding, twisting. Fleeting  
      freeze-frames of confusion and terror as the chaotic cortege stumbled through the shadows back 
      toward the Necropolis entrance. 
      Out in the square, Mortati let out a fearful gasp. "Is he bringing that up here?" 
      On televisions all over th e world, larger than life, the camerlegno raced upward out of the Necropolis 
      with the antimatter before him. "There will be no more death tonight!" 
      But the camerlegno was wrong.  
                         Angels & Demons      251  
      "Back!" the priest screamed. 
      The guards moved back. 
      With the entire world watching in wonder, the camerlegno ran around the chopper to the pilot's door 
      and yanked it open. "Out, son! Now!" 
      The guard jumped out. 
      The camerlegno looked at the high cockpit seat and knew that in his exhausted state, he would need 
      both hands to pull himself up. He turned to the pilot, trembling beside him, and thrust the canister into 
      his hands.  
      "Hold this. Hand it back when I'm in." 
      As the camerlegno pulled himself up, he could hear Robert Langdon yelling excitedly, running toward 
      the craft. Now you understand, the camerlegno thought. Now you have faith! 
      The camerlegno pulled himself up into the cockpit, adjusted a few familiar levers, and then turned back 
      to his window for the canister. 
      But the guard to whom he had given the canister stood empty-handed. "He took it!" the guard yelled. 
      The camerlegno felt his heart seize. "Who!" 
      The guard pointed. "Him!" 
      Robert Langdon was surprised by how heavy the canister was. He ran to the other side of the chopper 
      and jumped in the rear compartment where he and Vittoria had sat only hours ago. He left the door 
      open and buckled himself in. Then he yelled to the camerlegno in the front seat. 
      "Fly, Father!"  
      The camerlegno craned back at Langdon, his face bloodless with dread. "What are you doing!" 
      "You fly! I'll throw!" Langdon barked. "There's no time! Just fly the blessed chopper!" 
      The camerlegno seemed momentarily paralyzed, the media lights glaring through the cockpit darkening 
      the creases in his face. "I can do this alone," he whispered. "I am supposed to do this alone." 
      Langdon wasn't listening. Fly! he heard himself screaming. Now! I'm here to help you! Langdon looked 
      down at the canister and felt his breath catch in his throat when he saw the numbers. "Three minutes, 
      Father! Three!" 
      The number seemed to stun the camerlegno back to sobriety. Without hesitation, he turned back to the 
      controls. With a grinding roar, the helicopter lifted off.  
      Through a swirl of dust, Langdon could see Vittoria running toward the chopper. Their eyes met, and 
      then she dropped away like a sinking stone.

      In St. Peter's Square, Vittoria Vetra stared upward. The helicopter was a speck now, the media lights no 
      longer reaching it. Even the pounding of the rotors had faded to a distant hum. 
      It seemed, in that instant, that the entire world was focused upward, silenced in anticipation, necks 
      craned to the heavens... all peoples, all faiths... all hearts beating as one. 
      Vittoria's emotions were a cyclone of twisting agonies. As the helicopter disappeared from sight, she 
      pictured Robert's face, rising above her. What had he been thinking? Didn't he understand? 
      Around the square, television cameras probed the darkness, waiting. A sea of faces stared heavenward, 
      united in a silent countdown. The media screens all flickered the same tranquil scene... a Roman sky 
      illuminated with brilliant stars. Vittoria felt the tears begin to well. 
      Behind her on the marble escarpment, 161 cardinals stared up in silent awe. Some folded their hands in 
      prayer. Most stood motionless, transfixed. Some wept. The seconds ticked past. In homes, bars, 
      businesses, airports, hospitals around the world, souls were joined in universal witness. 
      Men and women locked hands. Others held their children. Time seemed to hover in limbo, souls 
      suspended in unison. 
      Then, cruelly, the bells of St. Peter's began to toll. 
      Vittoria let the tears come.  
      Then... with the whole world watching... time ran out. 
      The dead silence of the event was the most terrifying of all. 
      High above Vatican City, a pinpoint of light appeared in the sky. For a fleeting instant, a new heavenly 
      body had been born... a speck of light as pure and white as anyone had ever seen. 
      Then it happened. 
      A flash. The point billowed, as if feeding on itself, unraveling across the sky in a dilating radius of 
      blinding white. It shot out in all directions, accelerating with incomprehensible speed, gobbling up the 
      dark. As the sphere of light grew, it intensified, like a burgeoning fiend preparing to consume the entire 
      sky. It raced downward, toward them, picking up speed. 
      Blinded, the multitudes of starkly lit human faces gasped as one, shielding their eyes, crying out in 
      strangled fear. 
      As the light roared out in all directions, the unimaginable occurred. As if bound by God's own will, the 
      surging radius seemed to hit  a wall. It was as if the explosion were contained somehow in a giant glass 
      sphere. The light rebounded inward, sharpening, rippling across itself. The wave appeared to have 
      reached a predetermined diameter and hovered there. For that instant, a perfect and silent sphere of 
      light glowed over Rome. Night had become day. 
      Then it hit. 
      The concussion was deep and hollow-a thunderous shock wave from above. It descended on them like 
      the wrath of hell, shaking the granite foundation of Vatican City, knocking the breath out of people's 
      lungs, sending others stumbling backward. The reverberation circled the colonnade, followed by a 
      sudden torrent of warm air. The wind tore through the square, letting out a sepulchral moan as it 
      whistled through the columns and buffeted the walls. Dust swirled overhead as people huddled...  
      witnesses to Armageddon. 
      Then, as fast as it appeared, the sphere imploded, sucking back in on itself, crushing inward to the tiny 
      point of light from which it had come.

      R obert Langdon was no longer falling. There was no more terror. No pain. Not even the sound of the 
      racing wind. There was only the soft sound of lapping water, as though he were comfortably asleep on 
      a beach.  
      In a paradox of self -awareness, Langdon sensed this was death. He felt glad for it. He allowed the 
      drifting numbness to possess him entirely. He let it carry him wherever it was he would go. His pain 
      and fear had been anesthetized, and he did not wish it back at any price. His final memory had been 
      one that could only have been conjured in hell. 
      Take me. Please... 
      But the lapping that lulled in him a far-off sense of peace was also pulling him back. It was trying to 
      awaken him from a dream. No! Let me be! He did not want to awaken. He sensed demons gathering 
      on the perimeter of his bliss, pounding to shatter his rapture. Fuzzy images swirled. Voices yelled. 
      Wind churned. No, please! The more he fought, the more the fury filtered through. Then, harshly, he 
      was living it all again...  
      The helicopter was in a dizzying dead climb. He was trapped inside. Beyond the open door, the lights 
      of Rome looked farther away with every passing second. His survival instinct told him to jettison the 
      canister right now. Langdon knew it would take less than twenty seconds for the canister to fall half a 
      mile. But it would be falling toward a city of people. 
      Higher! Higher! 
      Langdon wondered how high they were now. Small prop planes, he knew, flew at altitudes of about 
      four miles. This helicopter had to be at a good fraction of that by now. Two miles up? Three? There 
      was still a chance. If they timed the drop perfectly, the canister would fall only partway toward earth, 
      exploding a safe distance over the ground and away from the chopper. Langdon looked out at the city 
      sprawling below them. 
      "And if you calculate incorrectly?" the camerlegno said. 
      Langdon turned, startled. The camerlegno was not even looking at him, apparently having read 
      Langdon's thoughts from the ghostly reflection in the windshield. Oddly, the camerlegno was no 
      longer engrossed in his controls. His hands were not even on the throttle. The chopper, it seemed, 
      was now in some sort of autopilot mode, locked in a climb. The camerlegno reached above his head, to 
      the ceiling of the cockpit, fishing behind a cable-housing, where he removed a key, taped there out of 
      view. 
      Langdon watched in bewilderment as the camerlegno quickly unlocked the metal cargo box bolted 
      between the seats. He removed some sort of large, black, nylon pack. He lay it on the seat next to him. 
      Langdon's thoughts churned. The camerlegno's movements seemed composed, as if he had a solution. 
      "Give me the canister," the camerlegno said, his tone serene. 
      Langdon did not know what to think anymore. He thrust the canister to the camerlegno. "Ninety 
      seconds!"  
      What the camerlegno did with the antimatter took Langdon totally by surprise. Holding the canister 
      carefully in his hands, the camerlegno placed it inside the cargo box. Then he closed the heavy lid and 
      used the key to lock it tight. "What are you doing!" Langdon demanded. 
      "Leading us from temptation." The camerlegno threw the key out the open window. 
      As the key tumbled into the night, Langdon felt his soul falling with it. 
      The camerlegno then took the nylon pack and slipped his arms through the straps. 
      He fastened a waist clamp around his stomach and cinched it all down like a backpack. He turned to a 
      dumbstruck Robert Langdon. 
      "I'm sorry," the camerlegno said. "It wasn't supposed to happen this way." Then he opened his door 
      and hurled himself into the night. 
      The image burned in Langdon's unconscious mind, and with it came the pain. Real pain. Physical pain. 
      Aching. Searing. He begged to be taken, to let it end, but as the water lapped louder in his ears, new 
      images began to flash. His hell had only just begun. He saw bits and pieces. Scattered frames of sheer 
                         Angels & Demons      257  
      Suddenly, like the surging crest of an unexpected wave, hope filled him again. With almost maniacal 
      vigor, Langdon yanked down hard with his right hand on the canopy. The tarp suddenly flapped 
      louder, billowing, cutting right to find the path of least resistance. Langdon felt himself drifting 
      sideways. He pulled again, harder, ignoring the pain in his palm. The tarp flared, and Langdon sensed 
      his body sliding laterally. Not much. But some! He looked beneath him again, to the sinuous serpent 
      of black. It was off to the right, but he was still pretty high. Had he waited too long? He pulled with all 
      his might and accepted somehow that it was now in the hands of God. He focused hard on the widest 
      part of the serpent and... for the first time in his life, prayed for a miracle. 
      The rest was a blur.  
      The darkness rushing up beneath him... the diving instincts coming back... the reflexive locking of his 
      spine and pointing of the toes... the inflating of his lungs to protect his vital organs... the flexing of his 
      legs into a battering ram... and finally... the thankfulness that the winding Tiber River was raging...  
      making its waters frothy and air-filled... and three times softer than standing water. 
      Then there was impact... and blackness. 
      It had been the thundering sound of the flapping canopy that drew the group's eyes away from the 
      fireball in the sky. The sky above Rome had been filled with sights tonight... a skyrocketing helicopter, 
      an enormous explosion, and now this strange object that had plummeted into the churning waters of 
      the Tiber River, directly off the shore of the river's tiny island, Isola Tiberina.  
      Ever since the island had been used to quarantine the sick during the Roman plague of A.D. 1656, it 
      had been thought to have mystic healing properties. For this reason, the island had later become the 
      site for Rome's Hospital Tiberina. 
      The body was battered when they pulled it onto shore. The man still had a faint pulse, which was 
      amazing, they thought. They wondered if it was Isola Tiberina's mythical reputation for healing that 
      had somehow kept his heart pumping. Minutes later, when the man began coughing and slowly 
      regained consciousness, the group decided the island must indeed be magical.

                           127 
        
       
      The images around him blurred, drifting in and out. Langdon's eyes slowly began to focus. His legs 
      ached, and his body felt like it had been run over by a truck. He was lying on his side on the ground. 
      Something stunk, like bile. He could still hear the incessant sound of lapping water. It no longer 
      sounded peaceful to him. There were other sounds too-talking close around him. He saw blurry white 
      forms. Were they all wearing white? Langdon decided he was either in an asylum or heaven. 
      From the burning in his throat, Langdon decided it could not be heaven.  
      "He's finished vomiting," one man said in Italian. "Turn him." The voice was firm and professional. 
      Langdon felt hands slowly rolling him onto his back. His head swam. He tried to sit up, but the hands 
      gently forced him back down. His body submitted. Then Langdon felt someone going through his 
      pockets, removing items. 
      Then he passed out cold. 
      Dr. Jacobus was not a religious man; the science of medicine had bred that from him long ago. And 
      yet, the events in Vatican City tonight had put his systematic logic to the test. Now bodies are falling 
      from the sky?  
      Dr. Jacobus felt the pulse of the bedraggled man they had just pulled from the Tiber River. The doctor 
      decided that God himself had hand-delivered this one to safety. The concussion of hitting the water 
      had knocked  the victim unconscious, and if it had not been for Jacobus and his crew standing out on 
      the shore watching the spectacle in the sky, this falling soul would surely have gone unnoticed and 
      drowned. 
      "�� Americano," a nurse said, going through the man's wallet after they pulled him to dry land. 
      American? Romans often joked that Americans had gotten so abundant in Rome that hamburgers 
      should become the official Italian food. But Americans falling from the sky? Jacobus flicked a penlight 
      in the man's eyes, testing his dilation. "Sir? Can you hear me? Do you know where you are?" 
      The man was unconscious again. Jacobus was not surprised. The man had vomited a lot of water after 
      Jacobus had performed CPR.  
      "Si chiama Robert Langdon," the nurse said, reading the man's driver's license.  
      The group assembled on the dock all stopped short. 
      "Impossibile!" Jacobus declared. Robert Langdon was the man from the television-the American 
      professor who had been helping the Vatican. Jacobus had seen Mr. Langdon, only minutes ago, getting 
      into a helicopter in St. Peter's Square and flying miles up into the air. Jacobus and the others had run 
      out to the dock to witness the antimatter explosion-a tremendous sphere of light like nothing any of 
      them had ever seen. How could this be the same man!  
      "It's him!" the nurse exclaimed, brushing his soaked hair back. "And I recognize his tweed coat!" 
      Suddenly someone was yelling from the hospital entryway. It was one of the patients. She was 
      screaming, going mad, holding her portable radio to the sky and praising God. Apparently  
      Camerlegno Ventresca had just miraculously appeared on the roof of the Vatican. 
      Dr. Jacobus decided, when his shift got off at 8 A.M., he was going straight to church. 
      The lights over Langdon's head were brighter now, sterile. He was on some kind of examination table. 
      He smelled astringents, strange chemicals. Someone had just given him an injection, and they had 
      removed his clothes. 
      Definitely not gypsies, he decided in his semiconscious delirium. Aliens, perhaps? Yes, he had heard 
      about things like this. Fortunately these beings would not harm him. All they wanted were his- 
      "Not on your life!" Langdon sat bolt upright, eyes flying open. 
      "Attento!" one of the creatures yelled, steadying him. His badge read Dr. Jacobus. He looked 
      remarkably human. 
      Langdon stammered, "I... thought..." 
      "Easy, Mr. Langdon. You're in a hospital." 
      The fog began to lift. Langdon felt a wave of relief. He hated hospitals, but they certainly beat aliens 
      harvesting his testicles. 
                         Angels & Demons      261  
      The woman looked unconcerned. She pointed proudly to one of her patches. "Sono conducente di 
      ambulanza." 
      "Ambulanza?" That explained it. Langdon felt like he could use an ambulance ride. 
      The woman led him around the side of the building. On an outcropping over the water was a cement 
      deck where her vehicle sat waiting. When Langdon saw the vehicle he stopped in his tracks. It was an 
      aging medevac chopper. The hull read Aero-Ambulanza. He hung his head. 
      The woman smiled. "Fly Vatican City. Very fast." 
                         Angels & Demons      263  
      had vowed to guide these proceedings with purity of soul, and this hesitancy was something he could 
      not deny.  
      "My friends," Mortati said, stepping to the altar. His voice did not seem his own. "I suspect I will 
      struggle for the rest of my days with the meaning of what I have witnessed tonight. And yet, what you 
      are suggesting regarding the camerlegno... it cannot possibly be God's will." 
      The room fell silent.  
      "How... can you say that?" one of the cardinals finally demanded. "The camerlegno saved the church. 
      God spoke to the camerlegno directly! The man survived death itself! What sign do we need!" 
      "The camerlegno is coming to us now," Mortati said. "Let us wait. Let us hear him before we have a 
      balloting. There may be an explanation." 
      "An explanation?"  
      "As your Great Elector, I have vowed to uphold the laws of conclave. You are no doubt aware that by 
      Holy Law the camerlegno is ineligible for election to the papacy. He is not a cardinal. He is a priest... a 
      chamberlain. There is also the question of his inadequate age." Mortati felt the stares hardening. "By 
      even allowing a balloting, I would be requesting that you endorse a man who Vatican Law proclaims 
      ineligible. I would be asking each of you to break a sacred oath." 
      "But what happened here tonight," someone stammered, "it certainly transcends our laws!" 
      "Does it?" Mortati boomed, not even knowing now where his words were coming from. "Is it God's 
      will that we discard the rules of the church? Is it God's will that we abandon reason and give ourselves 
      over to frenzy? " 
      "But did you not see what we saw?" another challenged angrily. "How can you presume to question 
      that kind of power!" 
      Mortati's voice bellowed now with a resonance he had never known. "I am not questioning God's 
      power! It is God who gave us reason and circumspection! It is God we serve by exercising prudence!" 
                         Angels & Demons      265  
      "No. I wouldn't let him. I offered him my silence in exchange for this meeting." 
      The camerlegno let out an odd laugh. "You plan to blackmail the church with a story that no one will 
      possibly believe?" 
      "I have no need of blackmail. I simply want to hear the truth from your lips. Leonardo Vetra was a 
      friend."   
      The camerlegno said nothing. He simply stared down at Kohler. 
      "Try this," Kohler snapped. "About a month ago, Leonardo Vetra contacted you requesting an urgent 
      audience with the Pope-an audience you granted because the Pope was an admirer of Leonardo's work 
      and because Leonardo said it was an emergency." 
      The camerlegno turned to the fire. He said nothing. 
      "Leonardo came to the Vatican in great secrecy. He was betraying his daughter's confidence by coming 
      here, a fact that troubled him deeply, but he felt he had no choice. His research had left him deeply 
      conflicted and in need of spiritual guidance from the church. In a private meeting, he told you and the 
      Pope that he had made a scientific discovery with profound religious implications. He had proved 
      Genesis was physically possible, and that intense sources of energy-what Vetra called God -could 
      duplicate the moment of Creation." 
      Silence. 
      "The Po pe was stunned," Kohler continued. "He wanted Leonardo to go public. His Holiness thought 
      this discovery might begin to bridge the gap between science and religion-one of the Pope's life 
      dreams. Then Leonardo explained to you the downside-the reason he required the church's guidance. 
      It seemed his Creation experiment, exactly as your Bible predicts, produced everything in pairs. 
      Opposites. Light and dark. Vetra found himself, in addition to creating matter, creating antimatter. 
      Shall I go on?" 
      The camerlegn o was silent. He bent down and stoked the coals. 
      "After Leonardo Vetra came here," Kohler said, "you came to CERN to see his work. Leonardo's 
      diaries said you made a personal trip to his lab." 
      The camerlegno looked up. Kohler went on. "The Pope could not travel without attracting media 
      attention, so he sent you. Leonardo gave you a secret tour of his lab. He showed you an antimatter 
      annihilation-the Big Bang -the power of Creation. He also showed you a large specimen he kept locked 
      away as proof that his new process could produce antimatter on a large scale. You were in awe. You 
      returned to Vatican City to report to the Pope what you had witnessed." 
      The camerlegno sighed. "And what is it that troubles you? That I would respect Leonardo's 
      confidentiality by pretending before the world tonight that I knew nothing of antimatter?" 
      "No! It troubles me that Leonardo Vetra practically proved the existence of your God, and you had 
      him murdered!"  
      The camerlegno turned now, his face revealing nothing. The only sound was the crackle of the fire. 
      Suddenly, the camera jiggled, and Kohler's arm appeared in the frame. He leaned forward, seeming to 
      struggle with something affixed beneath his wheelchair. When he sat back down, he held a pistol out 
      before him. The camera angle was a chilling one... looking from behind... down the length of the 
      outstretched gun... directly at the camerlegno. 
      Kohler said, "Confess your sins, Father. Now." 
      The camerlegno looked startled. "You will never get out of here alive." 
      "Death would be a welc ome relief from the misery your faith has put me through since I was a boy." 
      Kohler held the gun with both hands now. "I am giving you a choice. Confess your sins... or die right 
      now." 
      The camerlegno glanced toward the door. 
      "Rocher is outside," Kohler challenged. "He too is prepared to kill you." 
      "Rocher is a sworn protector of th-" 
      "Rocher let me in here. Armed. He is sickened by your lies. You have a single option. Confess to me. I 
      have to hear it from your very lips." 
      The camerlegno hesitated. 
      Kohler cocked his gun. "Do you really doubt I will kill you?" 
      "No matter what I tell you," the camerlegno said, "a man like you will never understand." 
                         Angels & Demons      267  
      There was a great flurry onscreen as the Swiss Guard burst into the room. The soundtrack exploded 
      with gunfire. Kohler clutched his chest, blown backward, bleeding, falling into his wheelchair. 
      "No!" Rocher called, trying to stop his guards from firing on Kohler. 
      The camerlegno, still writhing on the floor, rolled and pointed frantically at Rocher. "Illuminatus!" 
      "You bastard," Rocher yelled, running at him. "You sanctimonious bas-" 
      Chartrand cut him down with three bullets. Rocher slid dead across the floor. 
      Then the guards ran to the wounded camerlegno, gathering around him. As they huddled, the video 
      caught the face of a dazed Robert Langdon, kneeling beside the wheelchair, looking at the brand. Then, 
      the entire frame began lurching wildly. Kohler had regained consciousness and was detaching the tiny 
      camcorder from its holder under the arm of the wheelchair. Then he tried to hand the camcorder to 
      Langdon.  
      "G-give..." Kohler gasped. "G-give this to the m -media." 
      Then the screen went blank. 
                         Angels & Demons      269  
      and dressed him in a fresh white linen robe. They had also given him an injection of morphine for the 
      burn. The camerlegno wished they had not given him painkillers. Jesus endured his pain for three days 
      on the cross! He could already feel the drug uprooting his senses... a dizzying undertow. 
      As he walked into the chapel, he was not at all surprised to see the cardinals staring at him in wonder. 
      They are in awe of God, he reminded himself. Not of me, but how God works THROUGH me. 
      As he moved up the center aisle, he saw bewilderment in every face. And yet, with each new face he 
      passed, he sensed something else in their eyes. What was it? The camerlegno had tried to imagine 
      how they would receive him tonight. Joyfully? Reverently? He tried to read their eyes and saw neither 
      emotion.  
      It was then the camerlegno looked at the altar and saw Robert Langdon. 
                         Angels & Demons      271  
      When the camerlegno turned to Vittoria Vetra, the look on her face was one he could not quite 
      understand -pain yes, but anger? Certainly she must understand. Her father's genius was deadly. He had 
      to be stopped.  
      For the good of Mankind. 
      "He was doing God's work," Vittoria said. 
      "God's work is not done in a lab. It is done in the heart."  
      "My father's heart was pure! And his research proved-" 
      "His research proved yet again that man's mind is progressing faster than his soul!" The camerlegno's 
      voice was sharper than he had expected. He lowered his voice. "If a man as spiritual as your father 
      could create a weapon like the one we saw tonight, imagine what an ordinary man will do with his 
      technology."  
      "A man like you?"  
      The camerlegno took a deep breath. Did she not see? Man's morality was not advancing as fast as 
      man's science . Mankind was not spiritually evolved enough for the powers he possessed. We have 
      never created a weapon we have not used! And yet he knew that antimatter was nothing-another  
      weapon in man's already burgeoning arsenal. Man could already destroy. Man learned to kill long ago. 
      And his mother's blood rained down. Leonardo Vetra's genius was dangerous for another reason. 
      "For centuries," the camerlegno said, "the church has stood by while science picked away at religion bit 
      by bit. Debunking miracles. Training the mind to overcome the heart. Condemning religion as the 
      opiate of the masses. They denounce God as a hallucination-a delusional crutch for those too weak to 
      accept that life is meaningless. I could not stand by while science presumed to harness the power of 
      God himself! Proof, you say? Yes, proof of science's ignorance! What is wrong with the admission that 
      something exists beyond our understanding? The day science substantiates God in a lab is the day 
      people stop needing faith!" 
      "You mean the day they stop needing the church," Vittoria challenged, moving toward him. "Doubt is 
      your last shred of control. It is doubt that brings souls to you. Our need to know that life has meaning. 
      Man's insecurity and need for an enlightened soul assuring him everything is part of a master plan. But 
      the church is not the only enlightened soul on the planet! We all seek God in different ways. What are 
      you afraid of? That God will show himself somewhere other than inside these walls? That people 
      will find him in their own lives and leave your antiquated rituals behind? Religions evolve! The mind 
      finds answers, the heart grapples with new truths. My father was on your quest! A parallel path! Why  
      couldn't you see that? God is not some omnipotent authority looking down from above, threatening to 
      throw us into a pit of fire if we disobey. God is the energy that flows through the synapses of our 
      nervous system and the chambers of our hearts! God is in all things!" 
      "Except science," the camerlegno fired back, his eyes showing only pity. "Science, by definition, is 
      soulless. Divorced from the heart. Intellectual miracles like antimatter arrive in this world with no 
      ethical instructions attached. This in itself is perilous! But when science heralds its Godless pursuits as 
      the enlightened path? Promising answers to questions whose beauty is that they have no answers?" He 
      shook his head. "No." 
      There was a moment of silence. The camerlegno felt suddenly tired as he returned Vittoria's unbending 
      stare. This was not how it was supposed to be. Is this God's final test? It was Mortati who broke the 
      spell. "The preferiti," he said in a horrified whisper. "Baggia and the others. Please tell me you did 
      not..."  
      The camerlegno turned to him, surprised by the pain in his voice. Certainly Mortati could understand. 
      Headlines carried science's miracles every day. How long had it been for religion? Centuries? Religion 
      needed a miracle! Something to awaken a sleeping world. Bring them back to the path of righteousness. 
      Restore faith. The preferiti were not leaders anyway, they were transformers-liberals prepared to 
      embrace the new world and abandon the old ways! This was the only way. A new leader. Young. 
      Powerful. Vibrant. Miraculous. The preferiti served the church far more effectively in death than they 
      ever could alive. Horror and Hope. Offer four souls to save millions. The world would remember  
      them forever as martyrs. The church would raise glorious tribute to their names. How many thousands 
      have died for the glory of God? 
      They are only four.  
                         Angels & Demons      273  
      His shouts echoed off the back wall of the Sistine Chapel and then a profound silence fell. Time 
      seemed to stop. Michelangelo's Last Judgment rose ominously behind him... Jesus casting sinners into 
      hell. Tears brimmed in Mortati's eyes. 
      "What have you done, Carlo?" Mortati asked in a whisper. He closed his eyes, and a tear rolled. "His 
      Holiness?"   
      A collective sigh of pain went up, as if everyone in the room had forgotten until that very moment. 
      The Pope. Poisoned. 
      "A vile liar," the camerlegno said. 
      Mortati looked shattered. "What do you mean? He was honest! He... loved you." 
      "And I him." Oh, how I loved him! But the deceit! The broken vows to God! The camerlegno knew 
      they did not underst and right now, but they would. When he told them, they would see! His Holiness 
      was the most nefarious deceiver the church had ever seen. The camerlegno still remembered that 
      terrible night. He had returned from his trip to CERN with news of Vetra's Genesis and of antimatter's 
      horrific power. The camerlegno was certain the Pope would see the perils, but the Holy Father saw 
      only hope in Vetra's breakthrough. He even suggested the Vatican fund Vetra's work as a gesture of 
      goodwill toward spiritually based scientific research. Madness! The church investing in research that 
      threatened to make the church obsolete? Work that spawned weapons of mass destruction? The bomb 
      that had killed his mother...  
      "But... you can't!" the camerlegno had exclaimed. 
      "I owe a deep debt to science," the Pope had replied. "Something I have hidden my entire life. Science 
      gave me a gift when I was a young man. A gift I have never forgotten." 
      "I don't understand. What does science have to offer a man of God?" 
      "It is complicated," the Pope had said. "I will need time to make you understand. But first, there is a 
      simple fact about me that you must know. I have kept it hidden all these years. I believe it is time I told 
      you."  
      Then the Pope had told him the astonishing truth.

                           133 
        
       
      "The Pope fathered a child." 
      Inside the Sistine Chapel, the camerlegno stood unwavering as he spoke. Five solitary words of 
      astonishing disclosure. The entire assembly seemed to recoil in unison. The cardinals' accusing miens 
      evaporated into aghast stares, as if every soul in the room were praying the camerlegno was wrong. 
      The Pope fathered a child. 
      Langdon felt the shock wave hit him too. Vittoria's hand, tight in his, jolted, while Langdon's mind, 
      already numb with unanswered questions, wrestled to find a center of gravity. 
      The camerlegno's utterance seemed like it would hang forever in the air above them. Even in the 
      camerlegno's frenzied eyes, Langdon could see pure conviction. Langdon wanted to disengage, tell 
      himself he was lost in some grotesque nightmare, soon to wake up in a world that made sense. 
      "This must be a lie!" one of the cardinals yelled. 
      "I will not believe it!" another protested. "His Holiness was as devout a man as ever lived!" 
      It was Mortati who spoke next, his voice thin with devastation. "My friends. What the camerlegno says 
      is true." Every cardinal in the chapel spun as though Mortati had just shouted an obscenity. "The Pope 
      indeed fathered a child." 
      The cardinals blanched with dread. 
      The camerlegno looked stunned. "You knew? But... how could you possibly know this?" 
      Mortati sighed. "When His Holiness was elected... I was the Devil's Advocate."  
      There was a communal gasp. 
      Langdon understood. This meant the information was probably true. The infamous "Devil's Advocate" 
      was the authority when it came to scandalous information inside the Vatican. 
      Skeletons in a Pope's closet were dangerous, and prior to elections, secret inquiries into a candidate's  
      background were carried out by a lone cardinal who served as the "Devil's Advocate"-that individual 
      responsible for unearthing reasons why the eligible cardinals should not become Pope. The Devil's 
      Advocate was appointed in advance by the reigning Pope in preparation for his own death. The Devil's 
      Advocate was never supposed to reveal his identity. 
      Ever. 
      "I was the Devil's Advocate," Mortati repeated. "That is how I found out." 
      Mouths dropped. Apparently tonight was a night when all the rules were going out the window. 
      The camerlegno felt his heart filling with rage. "And you... told no one?" 
      "I confronted His Holiness," Mortati said. "And he confessed. He explained the entire story and asked 
      only that I let my heart guide my decision as to whether or not to reveal his secret." 
      "And your heart told you to bury the information?" 
      "He was the runaway favorite for the papacy. People loved him. The scandal would have hurt the 
      church deeply."  
      "But he f athered a child! He broke his sacred vow of celibacy!" The camerlegno was screaming now. 
      He could hear his mother's voice. A promise to God is the most important promise of all. Never break 
      a promise to God. "The Pope broke his vow!" 
      Mortati looked delirious with angst. "Carlo, his love... was chaste. He had broken no vow. He didn't 
      explain it to you?"  
      "Explain what?" The camerlegno remembered running out of the Pope's office while the Pope was 
      calling to him. Let me explain! 
      Slowly, sadly, Mortati let the  tale unfold. Many years ago, the Pope, when he was still just a priest, had 
      fallen in love with a young nun. Both of them had taken vows of celibacy and never even considered 
      breaking their covenant with God. Still, as they fell deeper in love, although they could resist the  
      temptations of the flesh, they both found themselves longing for something they never expected-to 
      participate in God's ultimate miracle of creation -a child. Their child. The yearning, especially in her, 
      became overwhelming. Still, God came first. A year later, when the frustration had reached almost 
                         Angels & Demons      277  
      "We need time to think and pray," another said. "We must act with foresight. The repercussions of 
      this..."  
      "He killed my father!" Vittoria said. "He killed his own father!" 
      "I'm certain he will pay for his sins," the cardinal holding her arm said sadly. 
      Vittoria was certain too, and she intended to ensure he paid. She tried to push toward the door again, 
      but the cardinals huddled closer, their faces frightened. 
      "What are you going to do?" she exclaimed. "Kill me?" 
      The old men blanched, and Vittoria immediately regretted her words. She could see these men were 
      gentle souls. They had seen enough violence tonight. They meant no threat. They were simply trapped. 
      Scared. 
      Trying to get their bearings.  
      "I want..." the wizened cardinal said,"... to do what is right." 
      "Then you will let her out," a deep voice declared behind her. The words were calm but absolute. 
      Robert Langdon arrived at her side, and she felt his hand take hers. "Ms. Vetra and I are leaving this 
      chapel. Right now."  
      Faltering, hesitant, the cardinals began to step aside.  
      "Wait!" It was Mortati. He moved toward them now, down the center aisle, leaving the camerlegno 
      alone and defeated on the altar. Mortati looked older all of a sudden, wearied beyond his years. His 
      motion was burdened with shame. He arrived, putting a hand on Langdon's shoulder and one on 
      Vittoria's as well. 
      Vittoria felt sincerity in his touch. The  man's eyes were more tearful now. 
      "Of course you are free to go," Mortati said. "Of course." The man paused, his grief almost tangible. "I 
      ask only this..." He stared down at his feet a long moment then back up at Vittoria and Langdon. "Let 
      me do it. I will go into the square right now and find a way. I will tell them. I don't know how... but I 
      will find a way. The church's confession should come from within. Our failures should be our own to 
      expose."  
      Mortati turned sadly back toward the altar. "Carlo, you have brought this church to a disastrous 
      juncture." 
      He paused, looking around. The altar was bare. 
      There was a rustle of cloth down the side aisle, and the door clicked shut. 
      The camerlegno was gone. 
                         Angels & Demons      279  
      church destroyed by scandal and abomination? No! God was the one who had willed the camerlegno 
      to act! Hadn't He?  
      Then he had seen it. Sitting on the altar. A sign. Divine communication-something ordinary seen in an 
      extraordinary light. The crucifix. Humble, wooden. Jesus on the cross. In that moment, it had all come 
      clear... the camerlegno was not alone. He would never be alone. This was His will... His meaning. 
      God had always asked great sacrifice of those he loved most. Why had the camerlegno been so slow to 
      understand? Was he too fearful? Too humble? It made no difference. God had found a way. The 
      camerlegno even understood now why Robert Langdon had been saved. It was to bring the truth. To 
      compel this ending. This was the sole path to the church's salvation!  
      The camerlegno felt like he was floating as he descended into the Niche of the Palliums. The surge of 
      morphine seemed relentless now, but he knew God was guiding him. 
      In the distance, he could hear the cardinals clamoring in confusion as they poured from the chapel, 
      yelling commands to the Swiss Guard. 
      But they would never find him. Not in time. 
      The camerlegno felt himself drawn... faster... descending the stairs into the sunken area where the  
      ninety-nine oil lamps shone brightly. God was returning him to Holy Ground. The camerlegno moved 
      toward the grate covering the hole that led down to the Necropolis. The Necropolis is where this night 
      would end. In the sacred darkness below. He lifted an oil lamp, preparing to descend. 
      But as he moved across the Niche, the camerlegno paused. Something about this felt wrong. How did 
      this serve God? A solitary and silent end? Jesus had suffered before the eyes of the entire world. Surely 
      this could not be God's will! The camerlegno listened for the voice of his God, but heard only the 
      blurring buzz of drugs. 
      "Carlo." It was his mother. "God has plans for you." 
      Bewildered, the camerlegno kept moving. Then, without warning, God arrived. 
      The camerl egno stopped short, staring. The light of the ninety-nine oil lanterns had thrown the 
      camerlegno's shadow on the marble wall beside him. Giant and fearful. A hazy form surrounded by 
      golden light. With flames flickering all around him, the camerlegno looked like an angel ascending to 
      heaven. He stood a moment, raising his arms to his sides, watching his own image. Then he turned, 
      looking back up the stairs. 
      God's meaning was clear. 
      Three minutes had passed in the chaotic hallways outside the Sistine Chapel, and still nobody could 
      locate the camerlegno. It was as if the man had been swallowed up by the night. Mortati was about to 
      demand a full-scale search of Vatican City when a roar of jubilation erupted outside in St. Peter's 
      Square. The spontaneous celebration of the crowd was tumultuous. The cardinals all exchanged 
      startled looks.  
      Mortati closed his eyes. "God help us." 
      For the second time that evening, the College of Cardinals flooded onto St. Peter's Square. Langdon 
      and Vittoria were swept up in the jostling crowd of cardinals, and they too emerged into the night air. 
      The media lights and cameras were all pivoted toward the basilica. And there, having just stepped onto 
      the sacred Papal Balcony located in the exact center of the towering fa��ade, Camerlegno Carlo 
      Ventresca stood with his arms raised to the heavens. Even far away, he looked like purity incarnate. A 
      figurine. Dressed in white. Flooded with light. 
      The energy in the square seemed to grow like a cresting wave, and all at once the Swiss Guard barriers 
      gave way. The masses streamed toward the basilica in a euphoric torrent of humanity. The onslaught 
      rushed forward -people crying, singing, media cameras flashing. Pandemonium. As the people flooded 
      in around the front of the basilica, the chaos intensified, until it seemed nothing could stop it. 
      And then something did.  
      High above, the camerlegno made the smallest of gestures. He folded his hands before him. Then he 
      bowed his head in silent prayer. One by one, then dozens by dozens, then hundreds by hundreds, the 
      people bowed their heads along with him. 
      The square fell silent... as if a spell had been cast. 
      In his mind, swirling and distant now, the camerlegno's prayers were a torrent of hopes and sorrows...

                           135 
        
       
      Dawn came late to Rome. 
      An early rainstorm had washed the crowds from St. Peter's Square. The media stayed on, huddling 
      under umbrellas and in vans, commentating on the evening's events. Across the world, churches 
      overflowed. It was a time of reflection and discussion... in all religions. Questions abounded, and yet 
      the answers seemed only to bring deeper questions. Thus far, the Vatican had remained silent, issuing 
      no statement whatsoever. 
      Deep in the Vatican Grottoes, Cardinal Mortati knelt alone before the open sarcophagus. He reached 
      in and closed the old man's blackened mouth. His Holiness looked peaceful now. In quiet repose for 
      eternity. 
      At Mortati's feet was a golden urn, heavy with ashes. Mortati had gathered the ashes himself and 
      brought them here. "A chance for forgiveness," he said to His Holiness, laying the urn inside the 
      sarcophagus at the Pope's side. "No love is greater than that of a father for His son." Mortati tucked 
      the urn out of sight beneath the papal robes. He knew this sacred grotto was reserved exclusively for 
      the relics of Popes, but somehow Mortati sensed this was appropriate.  
      "Signore?" someone said, entering the grottoes. It was Lieutenant Chartrand. He was accompanied by 
      three Swiss Guards. "They are ready for you in conclave." 
      Mortati nodded. "In a moment." He gazed one last time into the sarcophagus before him, and then 
      stood up.  He turned to the guards.  
      "It is time for His Holiness to have the peace he has earned." 
      The guards came forward and with enormous effort slid the lid of the Pope's sarcophagus back into 
      place. 
      It thundered shut with finality.  
      Mortati was alone as he crossed the Borgia Courtyard toward the Sistine Chapel. 
      A damp breeze tossed his robe. A fellow cardinal emerged from the Apostolic Palace and strode beside 
      him.  
      "May I have the honor of escorting you to conclave, signore?" 
      "The hon or is mine."  
      "Signore," the cardinal said, looking troubled. "The college owes you an apology for last night. We 
      were blinded by -" 
      "Please," Mortati replied. "Our minds sometimes see what our hearts wish were true." 
      The cardinal was silent a long time. Fin ally he spoke. "Have you been told? You are no longer our 
      Great Elector."  
      Mortati smiled. "Yes. I thank God for small blessings." 
      "The college insisted you be eligible." 
      "It seems charity is not dead in the church." 
      "You are a wise man. You would lead us well." 
      "I am an old man. I would lead you briefly." 
      They both laughed. 
      As they reached the end of the Borgia Courtyard, the cardinal hesitated. He turned to Mortati with a 
      troubled mystification, as if the precarious awe of the night before had slipped back into his heart. 
      "Were you aware," the cardinal whispered, "that we found no remains on the balcony?" 
      Mortati smiled. "Perhaps the rain washed them away." 
      The man looked to the stormy heavens. "Yes, perhaps..." 
                         Angels & Demons      283  
      "And in the wake of the explosion in the sky over the Vatican last night, CERN's antimatter 
      technology has become the hot topic among scientists, sparking excitement and controversy. A 
      statement read by Mr. Kohler's assistant in Geneva, Sylvie Baudeloque, announced this morning that 
      CERN's board of directors, although enthusiastic about antimatter's potential, are suspending all  
      research and licensing until further inquiries into its safety can be examined." 
      Excellent, Macri thought. Home stretch. 
      "Notably absent from our screens tonight," Glick reported, "is the face of Robert Langdon, the 
      Harvard professor who came to Vatican City yesterday to lend his expertise during this Illuminati crisis. 
      Although originally thought to have perished in the antimatter blast, we now have reports that 
      Langdon was spotted in St. Peter's Square after the explosion. How he got there is still speculation, 
      although a spokesman from Hospital Tiberina claims that Mr. Langdon fell out of the sky into the 
      Tiber River shortly after midnight, was treated, and released." Glick arched his eyebrows at the camera. 
      "And if that is true... it was indeed a night of miracles." 
      Perfect ending! Macri felt herself smiling broadly. Flawless wrap! Now sign off! 
      But Glick did not sign off. Instead, he paused a moment and then stepped toward the camera. He had 
      a mysterious smile. "But before we sign off..." 
      No! 
      "... I would like to invite a guest to join me." 
      Chinita's hands froze on the camera. A guest? What the hell is he doing? What guest! Sign off! But she  
      knew it was too late. Glick had committed.  
      "The man I am about to introduce," Glick said, "is an American... a renowned scholar." 
      Chinita hesitated. She held her breath as Glick turned to the small crowd around them and motioned 
      for his guest to step forward. Macri said a silent prayer. Please tell me he somehow located Robert 
      Langdon... and not some Illuminati-conspiracy nutcase. 
      But as Glick's guest stepped out, Macri's heart sank. It was not Robert Langdon at all. It was a bald 
      man in blue jeans and a flannel shirt. He had a cane and thick glasses. Macri felt terror. Nutcase! 
      "May I introduce," Glick announced, "the renowned Vatican scholar from De Paul University in 
      Chicago. Dr. Joseph Vanek." 
      Macri now hesitated as the man joined Glick on camera. This was no conspiracy buff; Macri had 
      actually heard of this guy. 
      "Dr. Vanek," Glick said. "You have some rather startling information to share with us regarding last 
      night's conclave." 
      "I do indeed," Vanek said. "After a night of such surprises, it is hard to imagine there are any surprises 
      left... and yet..." He paused. 
      Glick smiled. "And yet, there is a strange twist to all this." 
      Vanek nodded. "Yes. As perplexing as this will sound, I believe the College of ...Cardinals unknowingly 
      elected two Popes this weekend." 
      Macri almost dropped the camera. 
      Glick gave a shrewd smile. "Two Popes, you say?" 
      The scholar nodded. "Yes. I should first say that I have spent my life studying the laws of papal 
      election. Conclave judicature is extremely complex, and much of it is now forgotten or ignored as 
      obsolete. Even the Great Elector is probably not aware of what I am about to reveal. Nonetheless... 
      according to the ancient forgotten laws put forth in the Romano Pontifici Eligendo, Numero 63... 
      balloting is not the only method by which a Pope can be elected. There is another, more divine 
      method. It is called 'Acclamation by Adoration.' " He paused. "And it happened last night." 
      Glick gave his guest a riveted look. "Please, go on."  
      "As you may recall," the scholar continued, "last night, when Camerlegno Carlo Ventresca was 
      standing on the roof of the basilica, all of the cardinals below began calling out his name in unison." 
      "Yes, I recall."  
      "With that image in mind, allow me to read verbatim from the ancient electoral laws." The man pulled 
      some papers from his pocket, cleared his throat, and began to read. " 'Election by Adoration occurs 
      when... all the cardinals, as if by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, freely and spontaneously, unanimously 
      and aloud, proc laim one individual's name.' "

      High atop the steps of the Roman Coliseum, Vittoria laughed and called down to him. "Robert, hurry 
      up! I knew I should have married a younger man!" Her smile was magic. He struggled to keep up, but 
      his legs felt like stone. "Wait," he begged. 
      "Please..." 
      There was a pounding in his head. 
      Robert Langdon awoke with a start. 
      Darkness.  
      He lay still for a long time in the foreign softness of the bed, unable to figure out where he was. The 
      pillows were goose down, oversized and wonderful. The air smelled of potpourri. Across the room, 
      two glass doors stood open to a lavish balcony, where a light breeze played beneath a glistening cloud-
      swept moon. Langdon tried to remember how he had gotten here... and where here was. 
      Surreal wisps of memory sifted back into his consciousness... 
      A pyre of mystical fire... an angel materializing from out of the crowd... her soft hand taking his and 
      leading him into the night... guiding h is exhausted, battered body through the streets... leading him 
      here... to this suite... propping him half-sleeping in a scalding hot shower... leading him to this bed... 
      and watching over him as he fell asleep like the dead. 
      In the dimness now, Langdon could see a second bed. The sheets were tousled, but the bed was empty. 
      From one of the adjoining rooms, he could hear the faint, steady stream of a shower. 
      As he gazed at Vittoria's bed, he saw a boldly embroidered seal on her pillowcase. It read: HOTEL 
      BERNINI. Langdon had to smile. Vittoria had chosen well. Old World luxury overlooking Bernini's 
      Triton Fountain... there was no more fitting hotel in all of Rome. 
      As Langdon lay there, he heard a pounding and realized what had awoken him. 
      Someone was knocking at the door. It grew louder. 
      Confused, Langdon got up. Nobody knows we're here, he thought, feeling a trace of uneasiness. 
      Donning a luxuriant Hotel Bernini robe, he walked out of the bedroom into the suite's foyer. He stood 
      a moment at the heavy oak door, and then pulled it open.  
      A powerful man adorned in lavish purple and yellow regalia stared down at him. 
      "I am Lieutenant Chartrand," the man said. "Vatican Swiss Guard." 
      Langdon knew full well who he was. "How... how did you find us?" 
      "I saw you leave the square last night. I followed you. I'm relieved you're still here." 
      Langdon felt a sudden anxiety, wondering if the cardinals had sent Chartrand to escort Langdon and 
      Vittoria back to Vatican City. After all, the two of them were the only two people beyond the College 
      of Cardinals who knew the truth. They were a liability. 
      "His Holiness asked me to give this to you," Chartrand said, handing over an envelope sealed with the 
      Vatican signet. Langdon opened the envelope and read the handwritten note.  
      Mr. Lang don and Ms. Vetra,  
      Although it is my profound desire to request your discretion in the matters of the past 24 hours, I 
      cannot possibly presume to ask more of you than you have already given. I therefore humbly retreat 
      hoping only that you let your hearts guide you in this matter. The world seems a better place today... 
      maybe the questions are more powerful than the answers. My door is always open, 
      His Holiness, Saverio Mortati  
      Langdon read the message twice. The College of Cardinals had obviously chosen a noble and 
      munificent leader. 
      Before Langdon could say anything, Chartrand produced a small package. "A token of thanks from His 
      Holiness."  
      Langdon took the package. It was heavy, wrapped in brown paper.  
      "By his decree," Chartrand said, "this artifact is on indefinite loan to you from the sacred Papal Vault. 
      His Holiness asks only that in your last will and testament you ensure it finds its way home." 
      Langdon opened the package and was struck speechless. It was the brand. The Illuminati Diamond. 
                         Angels & Demons      287  
      Langdon nodded. "Mesmerizing." 
      "Would you say it's the most interesting thing in this room?" 
      Langdon scratched his head, making a show of pondering it. "Well, there is one thing that interests me 
      more." 
      She smiled and took a step toward him. "That being?" 
      "How you disproved that Einstein theory using tuna fish." 
      Vittoria threw up her hands. "Dio m��o! Enough with the tuna fish! Don't play with me, I'm warning 
      you." 
      Langdon grinned. "Maybe for your next experiment, you could study flounders and prove the earth is 
      flat." 
      Vittoria was steaming now, but the first faint hints of an exasperated smile appeared on her lips. "For 
      your information, professor, my next experiment will make scientific history. I plan to prove neutrinos 
      have mass."  
      "Neutrinos have mass?" Langdon shot her a stunned look. "I didn't even know they were Catholic!" 
      With one fluid motion, she was on him, pinning him down. "I hope you believe in life after death, 
      Robert Langdon." Vittoria was laughing as she straddled him, her hands holding him down, her eyes 
      ablaze with a mischievous fire. 
      "Actually," he choked, laughing harder now, "I've always had trouble picturing anything beyond this 
      world." 
      "Really? So you've never had a religious experience? A perfect moment of glorious rapture?" 
      Langdon shook his head. "No, and I seriously doubt I'm the kind of man who could ever have a 
      religious experience."  
      Vittoria slipped off her robe. "You've never been to bed with a yoga master, have you?"
