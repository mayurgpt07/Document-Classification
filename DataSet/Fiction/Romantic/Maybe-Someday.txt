Sydney
I just punched a girl in the face. Not just
any girl. My best friend. My roommate.
Well, as of five minutes ago, I guess I
should call her my ex-roommate.
Her nose began bleeding almost
immediately, and for a second, I felt bad
for hitting her. But then I remembered
what a lying, betraying whore she is, and
it made me want to punch her again. I
would have if Hunter hadn’t prevented it
by stepping between us.
So instead, I punched him. I didn’t do
any damage to him, unfortunately. Not
like the damage I’d done to my hand.
Punching someone hurts a lot worse
than I imagined it would. Not that I
spend an excessive amount of time
imagining how it would feel to punch
people. Although I am having that urge
again as I stare down at my phone at the
incoming text from Ridge. He’s another
one I’d like to get even with. I know he
technically has nothing to do with my
current predicament, but he could have
given me a heads-up a little sooner.
Therefore, I’d like to punch him, too.
Ridge: Are you OK? Do u want to
come up until the rain stops?
Of course, I don’t want to come up.
My fist hurts enough as it is, and if I
went up to Ridge’s apartment, it would
hurt a whole lot worse after I finished
with him.
I turn around and look up at his
balcony. He’s leaning against his
sliding-glass door; phone in hand,
watching me. It’s almost dark, but the
lights from the courtyard illuminate his
face. His dark eyes lock with mine and
the way his mouth curls up into a soft,
regretful smile makes it hard to
remember why I’m even upset with him
in the first place. He runs a free hand
through the hair hanging loosely over his
forehead, revealing even more of the
worry in his expression. Or maybe that’s
a look of regret. As it should be.
I decide not to reply and flip him off
instead. He shakes his head and shrugs
his shoulders, as if to say, I tried, and
then he goes back inside his apartment
and slides his door shut.
I put the phone back in my pocket
before it gets wet, and I look around at
the courtyard of the apartment complex
where I’ve lived for two whole months.
When we first moved in, the hot Texas
summer was swallowing up the last
traces of spring, but this courtyard
seemed to somehow still cling to life.
Vibrant blue and purple hydrangeas
lined the walkways leading up to the
staircases and the fountain affixed in the
center of the courtyard.
Now that summer has reached its most
unattractive peak, the water in the
fountain has long since evaporated. The
hydrangeas are a sad, wilted reminder of
the excitement I felt when Tori and I first
moved in here. Looking at the courtyard
now, defeated by the season, is an eerie
parallel to how I feel at the moment.
Defeated and sad.
I’m sitting on the edge of the now
empty cement fountain, my elbows
propped up on the two suitcases that
contain most of my belongings, waiting
for a cab to pick me up. I have no idea
where it’s going to take me, but I know
I’d rather be anywhere except where I
am right now. Which is, well, homeless.
I could call my parents, but that would
give them ammunition to start firing all
the We told you so’s at me.
We told you not to move so far away,
Sydney.
We told you not to get serious with
that guy.
We told you if you had chosen
prelaw over music, we would have paid
for it.
We told you to punch with your
thumb on the outside of your fist.
Okay, maybe they never taught me the
proper punching techniques, but if
they’re so right all the damn time, they
should have.
I clench my fist, then spread out my
fingers, then clench it again. My hand is
surprisingly sore, and I’m pretty sure I
should put ice on it. I feel sorry for guys.
Punching sucks.
Know what else sucks? Rain. It
always finds the most inappropriate time
to fall, like right now, while I’m
homeless.
The cab finally pulls up, and I stand
and grab my suitcases. I roll them behind
me as the cab driver gets out and pops
open the trunk. Before I even hand him
the first suitcase, my heart sinks as I
suddenly realize that I don’t even have
my purse on me.
Shit.
I look around, back to where I was
sitting on the suitcases, then feel around
my body as if my purse will magically
appear across my shoulder. But I know
exactly where my purse is. I pulled it off
my shoulder and dropped it to the floor
right before I punched Tori in her
overpriced, Cameron Diaz nose.
I sigh. And I laugh. Of course, I left
my purse. My first day of being
homeless would have been way too easy
if I’d had a purse with me.
“I’m sorry,” I say to the cab driver,
who is now loading my second piece of
luggage. “I changed my mind. I don’t
need a cab right now.”
I know there’s a hotel about a halfmile
from here. If I can just work up the
courage to go back inside and get my
purse, I’ll walk there and get a room
until I figure out what to do. It’s not as if
I can get any wetter.
The driver takes the suitcases back
out of the cab, sets them on the curb in
front of me, and walks back to the
driver’s side without ever making eye
contact. He just gets into his car and
drives away, as if my canceling is a
relief.
Do I look that pathetic?
I take my suitcases and walk back to
where I was seated before I realized I
was purseless. I glance up to my
apartment and wonder what would
happen if I went back there to get my
wallet. I sort of left things in a mess
when I walked out the door. I guess I’d
rather be homeless in the rain than go
back up there.
I take a seat on my luggage again and
contemplate my situation. I could pay
someone to go upstairs for me. But who?
No one’s outside, and who’s to say
Hunter or Tori would even give the
person my purse?
This really sucks. I know I’m going to
have to end up calling one of my friends,
but right now, I’m too embarrassed to
tell anyone how clueless I’ve been for
the last two years. I’ve been completely
blindsided.
I already hate being twenty-two, and I
still have 364 more days to go.
It sucks so bad that I’m . . . crying?
Great. I’m crying now. I’m a
purseless, crying, violent, homeless girl.
And as much as I don’t want to admit it,
I think I might also be heartbroken.
Yep. Sobbing now. Pretty sure this
must be what it feels like to have your
heart broken.
“It’s raining. Hurry up.”
I glance up to see a girl hovering over
me. She’s holding an umbrella over her
head and looking down at me with
agitation while she hops from one foot to
the other, waiting for me to do
something. “I’m getting soaked. Hurry.”
Her voice is a little demanding, as if
she’s doing me some sort of favor and
I’m being ungrateful. I arch an eyebrow
as I look up at her, shielding the rain
from my eyes with my hand. I don’t
know why she’s complaining about
getting wet, when there isn’t much
clothing to get wet. She’s wearing next
to nothing. I glance at her shirt, which is
missing its entire bottom half, and
realize she’s in a Hooters outfit.
Could this day get any weirder? I’m
sitting on almost everything I own in a
torrential downpour, being bossed
around by a bitchy Hooters waitress.
I’m still staring at her shirt when she
grabs my hand and pulls me up in a huff.
“Ridge said you would do this. I’ve got
to get to work. Follow me, and I’ll show
you where the apartment is.” She grabs
one of my suitcases, pops the handle out,
and shoves it at me. She takes the other
and walks swiftly out of the courtyard. I
follow her, for no other reason than the
fact that she’s taken one of my suitcases
with her and I want it back.
She yells over her shoulder as she
begins to ascend the stairwell. “I don’t
know how long you plan on staying, but
I’ve only got one rule. Stay the hell out
of my room.”
She reaches an apartment and opens
the door, never even looking back to see
if I’m following her. Once I reach the
top of the stairs, I pause outside the
apartment and look down at the fern
sitting unaffected by the heat in a planter
outside the door. Its leaves are lush and
green as if they’re giving summer the
middle finger with their refusal to
succumb to the heat. I smile at the plant,
somewhat proud of it. Then I frown with
the realization that I’m envious of the
resilience of a plant.
I shake my head, look away, then take
a hesitant step inside the unfamiliar
apartment. The layout is similar to my
own apartment, only this one is a double
split bedroom with four total bedrooms.
My and Tori’s apartment only had two
bedrooms, but the living rooms are the
same size.
The only other noticeable difference
is that I don’t see any lying,
backstabbing, bloody-nosed whores
standing in this one. Nor do I see any of
Tori’s dirty dishes or laundry lying
around.
The girl sets my suitcase down beside
the door, then steps aside and waits for
me to . . . well, I don’t know what she’s
waiting for me to do.
She rolls her eyes and grabs my arm,
pulling me out of the doorway and
further into the apartment. “What the hell
is wrong with you? Do you even speak?”
She begins to close the door behind her
but pauses and turns around, wide-eyed.
She holds her finger up in the air.
“Wait,” she says. “You’re not . . .” She
rolls her eyes and smacks herself in the
forehead. “Oh, my God, you’re deaf.”
Huh? What the hell is wrong with this
girl? I shake my head and start to answer
her, but she interrupts me.
“God, Bridgette,” she mumbles to
herself. She rubs her hands down her
face and groans, completely ignoring the
fact that I’m shaking my head. “You’re
such an insensitive bitch sometimes.”
Wow. This girl has some serious
issues in the people-skills department.
She’s sort of a bitch, even though she’s
making an effort not to be one. Now that
she thinks I’m deaf. I don’t even know
how to respond. She shakes her head as
if she’s disappointed in herself, then
looks straight at me.
“I . . . HAVE . . . TO . . . GO . . . TO .
. . WORK . . . NOW!” she yells very
loudly and painfully slowly. I grimace
and step back, which should be a huge
clue that I can hear her practically
yelling, but she doesn’t notice. She
points to a door at the end of the
hallway. “RIDGE . . . IS . . . IN . . . HIS
. . . ROOM!”
Before I have a chance to tell her she
can stop yelling, she leaves the
apartment and closes the door behind
her.
I have no idea what to think. Or what
to do now. I’m standing, soaking wet, in
the middle of an unfamiliar apartment,
and the only person besides Hunter and
Tori whom I feel like punching is now
just a few feet away in another room.
And speaking of Ridge, why the hell did
he send his psycho Hooters girlfriend to
get me? I take out my phone and have
begun to text him when his bedroom
door opens.
He walks out into the hallway with an
armful of blankets and a pillow. As soon
as he makes eye contact with me, I gasp.
I hope it’s not a noticeable gasp. It’s just
that I’ve never actually seen him up
close before, and he’s even betterlooking
from just a few feet away than
he is from across an apartment
courtyard.
I don’t think I’ve ever seen eyes that
can actually speak. I’m not sure what I
mean by that. It just seems as if he could
shoot me the tiniest glance with those
dark eyes of his, and I’d know exactly
what they needed me to do. They’re
piercing and intense and—oh, my God,
I’m staring.
The corner of his mouth tilts up in a
knowing smile as he passes me and
heads straight for the couch.
Despite his appealing and slightly
innocent-looking face, I want to yell at
him for being so deceitful. He shouldn’t
have waited more than two weeks to tell
me. I would have had a chance to plan
all this out a little better. I don’t
understand how we could have had two
weeks’ worth of conversations without
his feeling the need to tell me that my
boyfriend and my best friend were
screwing.
Ridge throws the blankets and the
pillow onto the couch.
“I’m not staying here, Ridge,” I say,
attempting to stop him from wasting time
with his hospitality. I know he feels bad
for me, but I hardly know him, and I’d
feel a lot more comfortable in a hotel
room than sleeping on a strange couch.
Then again, hotel rooms require
money.
Something I don’t have on me at the
moment.
Something that’s inside my purse,
across the courtyard, in an apartment
with the only two people in the world I
don’t want to see right now.
Maybe a couch isn’t such a bad idea
after all.
He gets the couch made up and turns
around, dropping his eyes to my soakingwet
clothes. I look down at the puddle of
water I’m creating in the middle of his
floor.
“Oh, sorry,” I mutter. My hair is
matted to my face; my shirt is now a seethrough
pathetic excuse for a barrier
between the outside world and my very
pink, very noticeable bra. “Where’s your
bathroom?”
He nods his head toward the bathroom
door.
I turn around, unzip a suitcase, and
begin to rummage through it while Ridge
walks back into his bedroom. I’m glad
he doesn’t ask me questions about what
happened after our conversation earlier.
I’m not in the mood to talk about it.
I select a pair of yoga pants and a tank
top, then grab my bag of toiletries and
head to the bathroom. It disturbs me that
everything about this apartment reminds
me of my own, with just a few subtle
differences. This is the same bathroom
with the Jack-and-Jill doors on the left
and right, leading to the two bedrooms
that adjoin it. One is Ridge’s, obviously.
I’m curious about who the other
bedroom belongs to but not curious
enough to open it. The Hooters girl’s one
rule was to stay the hell out of her room,
and she doesn’t seem like the type to kid
around.
I shut the door that leads to the living
room and lock it, then check the locks on
both doors to the bedrooms to make sure
no one can walk in. I have no idea if
anyone lives in this apartment other than
Ridge and the Hooters girl, but I don’t
want to chance it.
I pull off my sopping clothes and
throw them into the sink to avoid soaking
the floor. I turn on the shower and wait
until the water gets warm, then step in. I
stand under the stream of water and
close my eyes, thankful that I’m not still
sitting outside in the rain. At the same
time, I’m not really happy to be where I
am, either.
I never expected my twenty-second
birthday to end with me showering in a
strange apartment and sleeping on a
couch that belongs to a guy I’ve barely
known for two weeks, all at the hands of
the two people I cared about and trusted
the most.
Chapter One
TWO WEEKS EARLIER
Sydney
I slide open my balcony door and step
outside, thankful that the sun has already
dipped behind the building next door,
cooling the air to what could pass as a
perfect fall temperature. Almost on cue,
the sound of his guitar floats across the
courtyard as I take a seat and lean back
into the patio lounger. I tell Tori I come
out here to get homework done, because
I don’t want to admit that the guitar is the
only reason I’m outside every night at
eight, like clockwork.
For weeks now, the guy in the
apartment across the courtyard has sat on
his balcony and played for at least an
hour. Every night, I sit outside and listen.
I’ve noticed a few other neighbors
come out to their balconies when he’s
playing, but no one is as loyal as I am. I
don’t understand how someone could
hear these songs and not crave them day
after day. Then again, music has always
been a passion of mine, so maybe I’m
just a little more infatuated with his
sound than other people are. I’ve played
the piano for as long as I can remember,
and although I’ve never shared it with
anyone, I love writing music. I even
switched my major to music education
two years ago. My plan is to be an
elementary music teacher, although if my
father had his way, I’d still be prelaw.
“A life of mediocrity is a waste of a
life,” he said when I informed him that I
was changing my major.
A life of mediocrity. I find that more
amusing than insulting, since he seems to
be the most dissatisfied person I’ve ever
known. And he’s a lawyer. Go figure.
One of the familiar songs ends and the
guy with the guitar begins to play
something he’s never played before. I’ve
grown accustomed to his unofficial
playlist since he seems to practice the
same songs in the same order night after
night. However, I’ve never heard him
play this particular song before. The
way he’s repeating the same chords
makes me think he’s creating the song
right here on the spot. I like that I’m
witnessing this, especially since after
only a few chords, it’s already my new
favorite. All his songs sound like
originals. I wonder if he performs them
locally or if he just writes them for fun.
I lean forward in the chair, rest my
arms on the edge of the balcony, and
watch him. His balcony is directly
across the courtyard, far enough away
that I don’t feel weird when I watch him
but close enough that I make sure I’m
never watching him when Hunter’s
around. I don’t think Hunter would like
the fact that I’ve developed a tiny crush
on this guy’s talent.
I can’t deny it, though. Anyone who
watches how passionately this guy plays
would crush on his talent. The way he
keeps his eyes closed the entire time,
focusing intently on every stroke against
every guitar string. I like it best when he
sits cross-legged with the guitar upright
between his legs. He pulls it against his
chest and plays it like a stand-up bass,
keeping his eyes closed the whole time.
It’s so mesmerizing to watch him that
sometimes I catch myself holding my
breath, and I don’t even realize I’m
doing it until I’m gasping for air.
It also doesn’t help that he’s cute. At
least, he seems cute from here. His light
brown hair is unruly and moves with
him, falling across his forehead every
time he looks down at his guitar. He’s
too far away to distinguish eye color or
distinct features, but the details don’t
matter when coupled with the passion he
has for his music. There’s a confidence
to him that I find compelling. I’ve
always admired musicians who are able
to tune out everyone and everything
around them and pour all of their focus
into their music. To be able to shut the
world off and allow yourself to be
completely swept away is something
I’ve always wanted the confidence to
do, but I just don’t have it.
This guy has it. He’s confident and
talented. I’ve always been a sucker for
musicians, but more in a fantasy way.
They’re a different breed. A breed that
rarely makes for good boyfriends.
He glances at me as if he can hear my
thoughts, and then a slow grin appears
across his face. He never once pauses
the song while he continues to watch me.
The eye contact makes me blush, so I
drop my arms and pull my notebook
back onto my lap and look down at it. I
hate that he just caught me staring so
hard. Not that I was doing anything
wrong; it just feels odd for him to know I
was watching him. I glance up again, and
he’s still watching me, but he’s not
smiling anymore. The way he’s staring
causes my heart to speed up, so I look
away and focus on my notebook.
Way to be a creeper, Sydney.
“There’s my girl,” a comforting voice
says from behind me. I lean my head
back and tilt my eyes upward to watch
Hunter as he makes his way onto the
balcony. I try to hide the fact that I’m
shocked to see him, because I’m pretty
sure I was supposed to remember he
was coming.
On the off chance that Guitar Boy is
still watching, I make it a point to seem
really into Hunter’s hello kiss so that
maybe I’ll seem less like a creepy
stalker and more like someone just
casually relaxing on her balcony. I run
my hand up Hunter’s neck as he leans
over the back of my chair and kisses me
upside down.
“Scoot up,” Hunter says, pushing on
my shoulders. I do what he asks and
slide forward in the seat as he lifts his
leg over the chair and slips in behind
me. He pulls my back against his chest
and wraps his arms around me.
My eyes betray me when the sound of
the guitar stops abruptly, and I glance
across the courtyard once more. Guitar
Boy is eyeing us hard as he stands, then
goes back inside his apartment. His
expression is odd. Almost angry.
“How was school?” Hunter asks.
“Too boring to talk about. What about
you? How was work?”
“Interesting,” he says, brushing my
hair away from my neck with his hand.
He presses his lips to my neck and
kisses his way down my collarbone.
“What was so interesting?”
He tightens his hold on me, then rests
his chin on my shoulder and pulls me
back in the chair with him. “The oddest
thing happened at lunch,” he says. “I was
with one of the guys at this Italian
restaurant. We were eating out on the
patio, and I had just asked the waiter
what he recommended for dessert, when
a police car rounded the corner. They
stopped right in front of the restaurant,
and two officers jumped out with their
guns drawn. They began barking orders
toward us when our waiter mumbled,
‘Shit.’ He slowly raised his hands, and
the police jumped the barrier to the
patio, rushed toward him, threw him to
the ground, and cuffed him right at our
feet. After they read him his rights, they
pulled him to his feet and escorted him
toward the cop car. The waiter glanced
back at me and yelled, ‘The tiramisu is
really good!’ Then they put him in the
car and drove away.”
I tilt my head back and look up at him.
“Seriously? That really happened?”
He nods, laughing. “I swear, Syd. It
was crazy.”
“Well? Did you try the tiramisu?”
“Hell, yeah, we did. It was the best
tiramisu I’ve ever had.” He kisses me on
the cheek and pushes me forward.
“Speaking of food, I’m starving.” He
stands up and holds out his hand to me.
“Did you cook tonight?”
I take his hand and let him pull me up.
“We just had salad, but I can make you
one.”
Once we’re inside, Hunter takes a
seat on the couch next to Tori. She’s got
a textbook spread open across her lap as
she halfheartedly focuses on both
homework and TV at the same time. I
take out the containers from the fridge
and make his salad. I feel a little guilty
that I forgot tonight was one of the nights
he said he was coming. I usually have
something cooked when I know he’ll be
here.
We’ve been dating for almost two
years now. I met him during my
sophomore year in college, when he was
a senior. He and Tori had been friends
for years. After she moved into my dorm
and we became friends, she insisted I
meet him. She said we’d hit it off, and
she was right. We made it official after
only two dates, and things have been
wonderful since.
Of course, we have our ups and
downs, especially since he moved more
than an hour away. When he landed the
job in the accounting firm last semester,
he suggested I move with him. I told him
no, that I really wanted to finish my
undergrad before taking such a huge
step. In all honesty, I’m just scared.
The thought of moving in with him
seems so final, as if I would be sealing
my fate. I know that once we take that
step, the next step is marriage, and then
I’d be looking at never having the chance
to live alone. I’ve always had a
roommate, and until I can afford my own
place, I’ll be sharing an apartment with
Tori. I haven’t told Hunter yet, but I
really want to live alone for a year. It’s
something I promised myself I would do
before I got married. I don’t even turn
twenty-two for a couple of weeks, so
it’s not as if I’m in any hurry.
I take Hunter’s food to him in the
living room.
“Why do you watch this?” he says to
Tori. “All these women do is talk shit
about each other and flip tables.”
“That’s exactly why I watch it,” Tori
says, without taking her eyes off the TV.
Hunter winks at me and takes his
food, then props his feet up on the coffee
table. “Thanks, babe.” He turns toward
the TV and begins eating. “Can you grab
me a beer?”
I nod and walk back into the kitchen. I
open the refrigerator door and look on
the shelf where he always keeps his
extra beer. I realize as I’m staring at
“his” shelf that this is probably how it
begins. First, he has a shelf in the
refrigerator. Then he’ll have a
toothbrush in the bathroom, a drawer in
my dresser, and eventually, his stuff will
infiltrate mine in so many ways it’ll be
impossible for me ever to be on my own.
I run my hands up my arms, rubbing
away the sudden onset of discomfort
washing over me. I feel as if I’m
watching my future play out in front of
me. I’m not so sure I like what I’m
imagining.
Am I ready for this?
Am I ready for this guy to be the guy I
bring dinner to every night when he gets
home from work?
Am I ready to fall into this
comfortable life with him? One where I
teach all day and he does people’s taxes,
and then we come home and I cook
dinner and I “grab him beers” while he
props his feet up and calls me babe, and
then we go to our bed and make love at
approximately nine P.M. so we won’t be
tired the next day, in order to wake up
and get dressed and go to work and do it
all over again?
“Earth to Sydney,” Hunter says. I hear
him snap his fingers twice. “Beer?
Please, babe?”
I quickly grab his beer, give it to him,
then head straight to my bathroom. I turn
the water on in the shower, but I don’t
get in. Instead, I lock the door and sink
to the floor.
We have a good relationship. He’s
good to me, and I know he loves me. I
just don’t understand why every time I
think about a future with him, it’s not an
exciting thought.
Ridge
Maggie leans forward and kisses my
forehead. “I need to go.”
I’m on my back with my head and
shoulders partially propped against my
headboard. She’s straddling my lap and
looking down at me regretfully. I hate
that we live so far apart now, but it
makes the time we do spend together a
lot more meaningful. I take her hands so
she’ll shut up, and I pull her to me,
hoping to persuade her not to leave just
yet. She laughs and shakes her head. She
kisses me, but only briefly, and then she
pulls away again. She slides off my lap,
but I don’t let her make it very far before
I lunge forward and pin her to the
mattress. I point to her chest.
“You”—I lean in and kiss the tip of
her nose—“need to stay one more night.”
“I can’t. I have class.”
I grab her wrists and pin her arms
above her head, then press my lips to
hers. I know she won’t stay another
night. She’s never missed a day of class
in her life, unless she was too sick to
move. I sort of wish she was feeling a
little sick right now, so I could make her
stay in bed with me.
I slide my hands from her wrists,
delicately up her arms until I’m cupping
her face. Then I give her one final kiss
before I reluctantly pull away from her.
“Go. And be careful. Let me know when
you make it home.”
She nods and pushes herself off the
bed. She reaches across me and grabs
her shirt, then pulls it on over her head. I
watch her as she walks around the room
and gathers the clothes I pulled off her in
a hurry.
After five years of dating, most
couples would have moved in together
by now. However, most peoples’ other
halves aren’t Maggie. She’s so fiercely
independent it’s almost intimidating. But
it’s understandable, considering how her
life has gone. She’s been caring for her
grandfather since I met her. Before that,
she spent the majority of her teenage
years helping him care for her
grandmother, who died when Maggie
was sixteen. Now that her grandfather is
in a nursing home, she finally has a
chance to live alone while finishing
school, and as much as I want her here
with me, I also know how important this
internship is for her. So for the next year,
I’ll suck it up while she’s in San Antonio
and I’m here in Austin. I’ll be damned if
I ever move out of Austin, especially for
San Antonio.
Unless she asked, of course.
“Tell your brother I said good luck.”
She’s standing in my bedroom doorway,
poised to leave. “And you need to quit
beating yourself up, Ridge. Musicians
have blocks, just like writers do. You’ll
find your muse again. I love you.”
“I love you, too.”
She smiles and backs out of my
bedroom. I groan, knowing she’s trying
to be positive with the whole writer’s
block thing, but I can’t stop stressing
about it. I don’t know if it’s because
Brennan has so much riding on these
songs now or if it’s because I’m
completely tapped out, but the words
just aren’t coming. Without lyrics I’m
confident in, it’s hard to feel good about
the actual musical aspect of writing.
My phone vibrates. It’s a text from
Brennan, which only makes me feel
worse about the fact that I’m stuck.
Brennan: It’s been weeks. Please tell
me you have something.
Me: Working on it. How’s the tour?
Brennan: Good, but remind me not to
allow Warren to schedule this many
gigs on the next leg.
Me: Gigs are what gets your name out
there.
Brennan: OUR name. I’m not telling
you again to stop acting like you aren’t
half of this.
Me: I won’t be half if I can’t work
through this damn block.
Brennan: Maybe you should get out
more. Cause some unnecessary
drama in your life. Break up with
Maggie for the sake of art. She’ll
understand. Heartache helps with
lyrical inspiration. Don’t you ever listen
to country?
Me: Good idea. I’ll tell Maggie you
suggested that.
Brennan: Nothing I say or do could
ever make Maggie hate me. Give her a
kiss for me, and get to writing. Our
careers are resting squarely on your
shoulders.
Me: Asshole.
Brennan: Ah! Is that anger I detect in
your text? Use it. Go write an angry
song about how much you hate your
little brother, then send it to me. ;)
Me: Yeah. I’ll give it to you after you
finally get your shit out of your old
bedroom. Bridgette’s sister might move
in next month.
Brennan: Have you ever met Brandi?
Me: No. Do I want to?
Brennan: Only if you want to live with
two Bridgettes.
Me: Oh, shit.
Brennan: Exactly. TTYL.
I close out the text to Brennan and
open up a text to Warren.
Me: We’re good to go on the
roommate search. Brennan says hell
no to Brandi. I’ll let you break the news
to Bridgette, since you two get along
so well.
Warren: Well, motherfucker.
I laugh and hop off the bed, then head
to the patio with my guitar. It’s almost
eight, and I know she’ll be on her
balcony. I don’t know how weird my
actions are about to seem to her, but all I
can do is try. I’ve got nothing to lose.
Chapter Two
Sydney
I’m mindlessly tapping my feet and
singing along to his music with my
made-up lyrics when he stops playing
mid-song. He never stops mid-song, so
naturally, I glance in his direction. He’s
leaning forward, staring right at me. He
holds up his index finger, as if to say,
Hold on, and he sets his guitar beside
him and runs into his apartment.
What the hell is he doing?
And oh, my God, why does the fact
that he’s acknowledging me make me so
nervous?
He comes back outside with paper
and a marker in his hands.
He’s writing. What the hell is he
writing?
He holds up two sheets of paper, and I
squint to get a good look at what he’s
written.
A phone number.
Shit. His phone number?
When I don’t move for several
seconds, he shakes the papers and points
at them, then points back to me.
He’s insane. I’m not calling him. I
can’t call him. I can’t do that to Hunter.
The guy shakes his head, then grabs a
fresh sheet of paper and writes
something else on it, then holds it up.
Text me.
When I still don’t move, he flips the
paper over and writes again.
I have a ?
A question. A text. Seems harmless
enough. When he holds up the papers
with his phone number again, I pull out
my phone and enter his phone number. I
stare at the screen for a few seconds, not
really knowing what to say in the text, so
I go with:
Me: What’s your question?
He looks down at his phone, and I can
see him smile when he receives my text.
He drops the paper and leans back in his
chair, typing. When my phone vibrates, I
hesitate a second before looking down at
it.
Him: Do you sing in the shower?
I shake my head, confirming my initial
suspicion. He’s a flirt. Of course he is,
he’s a musician.
Me: I don’t know what kind of question
that is, but if this is your attempt at
flirting, I’ve got a boyfriend. Don’t
waste your time.
I hit send and watch him read the text.
He laughs, and this irritates me. Mostly
because his smile is so . . . smiley. Is
that even a word? I don’t know how else
to describe it. It’s as if his whole face
smiles right along with his mouth. I
wonder what that smile looks like up
close.
Him: Believe me, I know you have a
boyfriend, and this is definitely not
how I flirt. I just want to know if you
sing in the shower. I happen to think
highly of people who sing in the
shower and need to know the answer
to that question in order to decide if I
want to ask you my next question.
I read the lengthy text, admiring his
fast typing. Guys aren’t normally as
skilled as girls when it comes to speedtexting,
but his replies are almost
instantaneous.
Me: Yes, I sing in the shower. Do you
sing in the shower?
Him: No, I don’t.
Me: How can you think highly of
people who sing in the shower if you
don’t sing in the shower?
Him: Maybe the fact that I don’t sing in
the shower is why I think highly of
people who do sing in the shower.
This conversation isn’t going
anywhere.
Me: Why did you need this vital piece
of information from me?
He stretches his legs out and props his
feet up on the edge of the patio, then
stares at me for a few seconds before
returning his attention to his phone.
Him: I want to know how you’re singing
lyrics to my songs when I haven’t even
added lyrics to them yet.
My cheeks instantly heat from
embarrassment. Busted.
I stare at his text, then glance up at
him. He’s watching me, expressionless.
Why the hell didn’t I think that he
could see me sitting out here? I never
thought he would notice me singing
along to his music. Hell, until last night,
I never thought he even noticed me. I
inhale, wishing I’d never made eye
contact with him to begin with. I don’t
know why I find this embarrassing, but I
do. It seems as if I’ve invaded his
privacy in some way, and I hate that.
Me: I tend to favor songs with lyrics,
and I was tired of wondering what the
lyrics to your songs were, so I guess I
made up a few of my own.
He reads the text, then glances up at
me without a hint of his infectious smile.
I don’t like his serious glances. I don’t
like what they do to my stomach. I also
don’t like what his smiley smile does to
my stomach. I wish he would stick to a
simple, unattractive, emotionless
expression, but I’m not sure he’s capable
of that.
Him: Will you send them to me?
Oh, God. Hell, no.
Me: Hell, no.
Him: Please?
Me: No.
Him: Pretty please?
Me: No, thank you.
Him: What’s your name?
Me: Sydney. Yours?
Him: Ridge.
Ridge. That fits him. Musical-artistymoody
type.
Me: Well, Ridge, I’m sorry, but I don’t
write lyrics that anyone would want to
hear. Do you not write lyrics to your
own songs?
He begins to text, and it’s a really
long text. His fingers move swiftly over
his phone while he types. I’m afraid I’m
about to receive an entire novel from
him. He looks up at me just as my phone
vibrates.
Ridge: I guess you could say I’m
having a bad case of writer’s block.
Which is why I really, really wish you
would just send me the lyrics you sing
while I’m playing. Even if you think
they’re stupid, I want to read them.
You somehow know every single song
I play, even though I’ve never played
them for anyone except when I
practice out here.
How does he know I know all his
songs? I bring a hand up to my cheek
when I feel it flush, knowing he’s been
watching me a lot longer than I initially
thought. I swear, I have to be the most
unintuitive person in this entire world. I
glance up at him and he’s continuing
with another text, so I look back to my
phone and wait for it.
Ridge: I can see it in the way your
whole body responds to the guitar.
You tap your feet, you move your
head. And I’ve even tried to test you
by slowing down the song every once
in a while to see if you would notice,
and you always do. Your body stops
responding when I change something
up. So just by watching you, I can tell
you have an ear for music. And since
you sing in the shower, it probably
means you’re an okay singer. Which
also means that maybe there’s a
chance you have a talent for writing
lyrics. So, Sydney, I want to know
what your lyrics are.
I’m still reading when another text
comes through.
Ridge: Please. I’m desperate.
I inhale a deep breath, wishing more
than anything that this conversation had
never started. I don’t know how in the
hell he can come to all these conclusions
without my ever having noticed him
watching me. In a way, it eases my
embarrassment over the fact that he saw
me watching him. But now that he wants
to know what lyrics I made up, I’m
embarrassed for an entirely different
reason. I do sing, but not well enough to
do anything with it professionally. My
passion is mostly for music itself, not at
all for performing it. And as much as I
do love writing lyrics, I’ve never shared
anything I’ve written. It seems too
intimate. I’d almost rather he had sent
me a vulgar, flirtatious come-on.
I jump when my phone vibrates again.
Ridge: Okay, we’ll make a deal. Pick
one song of mine, and send me the
lyrics to just that one song. Then I’ll
leave you alone. Especially if they’re
stupid.
I laugh. And cringe. He’s not going to
let up. I’m going to have to change my
number.
Ridge: I know your phone number
now, Sydney. I’m not giving up until
you send me lyrics to at least one
song.
Jesus. He’s not going away.
Ridge: And I also know where you live.
I’m not above begging on my knees at
your front door.
Ugh!
Me: Fine. Stop with the creepy threats.
One song. But I’ll have to write the
lyrics down while you play it first,
because I’ve never written them out
before.
Ridge: Deal. Which song? I’ll play it
right now.
Me: How would I tell you which song,
Ridge? I don’t know the names of any
of them.
Ridge: Yeah, me, neither. Hold up
your hand when I get to the one you
want me to play.
He puts down his phone and picks up
his guitar, then begins playing one of the
songs. It’s not the one I want him to play,
though, so I shake my head. He switches
to another song, and I continue to shake
my head until the familiar chords to one
of my favorites meets my ears. I hold up
my hand, and he grins, then starts the
song over from the beginning. I pull my
notebook in front of me and pick up my
pen, then begin to write down the lyrics
I’ve put to it.
He has to play the song three times
before I finally get them all out. It’s
almost dark now, and it’s hard to see, so
I pick up my phone.
Me: It’s too dark to read. I’ll go inside
and text them to you, but you have to
promise you’ll never ask me to do this
again.
The light from his phone illuminates
his smile, and he nods at me, then picks
up his guitar and walks back inside his
apartment.
I go to my room and sit on the bed,
wondering if it’s too late to change my
mind. I feel as if this whole conversation
just ruined my eight o’clock patio time. I
can’t go back outside and listen to him
ever again. I liked it better when I
thought he didn’t know I was there. It
was like my own personal space with
my own personal concert. Now I’ll be
way too aware of him to actually enjoy
listening, and I curse him for ruining that.
I regretfully text him my lyrics, then
turn my phone on silent and leave it on
my bed as I go into the living room and
try to forget this ever happened.
Ridge
Holy shit. She’s good. Really good.
Brennan is going to love this. I know if
he agrees to use them, we’ll need her to
sign a release, and we’ll have to pay her
something. But it’s worth it, especially if
the rest of her lyrics are as good as
these.
But the question is, will she be
willing to help out? She obviously
doesn’t have much confidence in her
talent, but that’s the least of my worries.
The biggest worry is how I’ll persuade
her to send me more lyrics. Or how to
get her to write with me. I doubt her
boyfriend would go for that. He has to
be the biggest jerk I’ve ever laid eyes
on. I can’t believe the balls of that guy,
especially after watching him last night.
He comes outside on the patio and kisses
Sydney, cuddling up to her in the chair
like the most attentive boyfriend in the
world. Then, the second she turns her
back, he’s out on the patio with the other
chick. Sydney must have been in the
shower, because the two of them rushed
outside as if they were on a timer, and
the chick had her legs wrapped around
his waist and her mouth on his faster
than I could even blink. And it wasn’t a
first-time occurrence. I’ve seen it
happen so many times I’ve lost count.
It’s really not my place to inform
Sydney that the guy she’s dating is
screwing her roommate. I especially
can’t tell her through a text. But if
Maggie were cheating on me, I’d sure as
hell want to know about it. I just don’t
know Sydney well enough to tell her
something like that. Usually, the person
to break the news is the one to catch all
the blame, anyway. Especially if the
person being cheated on doesn’t want to
believe it. I could send her an
anonymous note, but the douchebag
boyfriend would more than likely be
able to talk his way out of it.
I won’t do anything for now. It’s not
my place, and until I get to know her
better, I’m not in a position for her to
trust me. My phone vibrates in my
pocket, and I pull it out, hoping Sydney
decided to send me more lyrics, but the
text is from Maggie.
Maggie: Almost home. See you in two
weeks.
Me: I didn’t say text me when you’re
almost home. I said text me when
you’re home. Now, stop texting and
driving.
Maggie: Okay.
Me: Stop!
Maggie: Okay!
I toss the phone onto the bed and
refuse to text her back. I’m not giving her
a reason to text me again until she makes
it home. I walk to the kitchen for a beer,
then take a seat next to a passed-out
Warren on the couch. I grab the remote
and hit info to see what he’s watching.
Porn.
Figures. The guy can’t watch anything
without nudity. I start to change the
channel, but he snatches the remote out
of my hands. “It’s my night.”
I don’t know if it was Warren or
Bridgette who decided we should divvy
up the TV, but it was the worst idea
ever. Especially since I’m still not sure
which night is actually mine, even
though, technically, this is my apartment.
I’m lucky if either of them pays rent on a
quarterly basis. I put up with it because
Warren has been my best friend since
high school, and Bridgette is . . . well,
she’s too mean for me to even want to
strike up a conversation with her. I’ve
avoided that since Brennan let her move
in six months ago. I really don’t have to
worry about money right now, thanks to
my job and the cut Brennan gives me, so
I just leave it alone. I still don’t know
how Brennan met Bridgette or how
they’re involved, but even though their
relationship isn’t sexual, he obviously
cares about her. I have no idea how or
why, since she doesn’t have any
noticeable redeeming qualities other
than how she looks in her Hooters
uniform.
And of course, the second that thought
passes through my head, so do the words
Maggie said when she found out
Bridgette was moving in with us.
“I don’t care if she moves in. The
worst thing that could happen would be
for you to cheat on me. Then I’d have to
break up with you, then your heart would
shatter, and we’d both be miserable for
life, and you would be so depressed
you’d never be able to get it up again. So
make sure if you do cheat, it’s the best
sex you ever have, because it’ll also be
the last sex you ever have.”
She doesn’t have to worry about my
cheating on her, but the scenario she
painted was enough to ensure that I don’t
even look at Bridgette in her uniform.
How in the hell did my thoughts
wander this far?
This is why I’m having writer’s
block; I can’t seem to focus on anything
important lately. I go back to my room to
transfer the lyrics Sydney sent onto
paper, and I begin to work out how to
add them to the music. I want to text
Sydney to tell her what I think about
them, but I don’t. I should leave her
hanging a little while longer. I know
how nerve-racking it is to send someone
a piece of yourself and then have to sit
back and wait for it to be judged. If I
make her wait long enough, maybe once
I tell her how brilliant she is, she’ll have
developed a craving to send me more.
It might be a little cruel, but she has
no idea how much I need her. Now that
I’m pretty sure I’ve found my muse, I
have to work it just right so she doesn’t
slip away.
Chapter Three
Sydney
If he hated them, the least he could have
done was send a thank you. I know it
shouldn’t bother me, but it does.
Especially because I never wanted to
send them to him in the first place. I
wasn’t expecting him to praise me, but
the fact that he begged so hard for them
and then just ignored them sort of
irritates me.
And he hasn’t been outside at his
usual time in almost a week. I’ve wanted
to text him about it so many times, but if
I do, then it’ll seem as if I care what he
thinks of the lyrics. I don’t want to care.
But I can tell by how disappointed I feel
that I do care. I hate that I want him to
like my lyrics. But the thought of actually
having a hand in a song is a little bit
exciting.
“Food should be here in a little while.
I’m going to get the clothes out of the
dryer,” Tori says. She opens the front
door, and I perk up on the couch when I
hear the familiar sound of the guitar from
outside. She closes the door behind her,
and as much as I want to ignore it, I rush
to my room and quietly slide out onto the
balcony, books in hand. If I sink far
enough into my chair, he might not notice
I’m out here.
But he’s looking straight at my
balcony when I step outside. He doesn’t
acknowledge me with a smile or even a
nod of his head when I take my seat. He
just continues playing, and it makes me
curious to see if he’s just going to
pretend our conversation last week
never happened. I sort of hope so,
because I’d like to pretend it never
happened.
He plays the familiar songs, and it
doesn’t take me long to let go of my
embarrassment over the fact that he
thought my lyrics were stupid. I tried to
warn him.
I finish up my homework while he’s
still playing, close my books and lean
back, and close my eyes. It’s quiet for a
minute, and then he begins playing the
song I sent him lyrics for. In the middle
of the song, the guitar pauses for several
seconds, but I refuse to open my eyes.
He continues playing just as my phone
vibrates with an incoming text.
Ridge: You’re not singing.
I glance at him, and he’s staring at me
with a grin. He looks back down at his
guitar and watches his hands as he
finishes the song. Then he picks up his
phone and sends another text.
Ridge: Do you want to know what I
thought of the lyrics?
Me: No, I’m pretty positive I know what
you thought. It’s been a week since I
sent them to you. No worries. I told
you they were stupid.
Ridge: Yeah, sorry about the silence. I
had to leave town for a few days.
Family emergency.
I don’t know if he’s telling the truth,
but the fact that he claims he’s been out
of town eases my fear that he hasn’t been
out on his balcony because of me.
Me: Everything okay?
Ridge: Yep.
Me: Good.
Ridge: I’m only going to say this once,
Sydney. Are you ready?
Me: Oh, God. No. I’m turning off my
phone.
Ridge: I know where you live.
Me: Fine.
Ridge: You’re incredible. Those lyrics.
I can’t even describe to you how
perfect they are for the song. How in
the hell does that come out of you?
And why can’t you see that you need
to LET it come out of you? Don’t hold it
in. You’re doing the world a huge
disservice with your modesty. I know I
agreed not to ask you for more, but
that was because I really didn’t expect
to get what I got from you. I need
more. Give me, give me, give me.
I let out a huge breath. Until this
moment, I didn’t realize exactly how
much his opinion mattered. I can’t look
up at him yet. I continue to stare at my
phone for much longer than it takes me to
read the text. I don’t even text him back,
because I’m still relishing the
compliment. If he said he loved it, I
would have accepted his opinion with
relief, and I would have moved on. But
the words he just texted were like stairs
stacked one on top of the other, and each
compliment was like me running up each
step until I reached the top of the damn
world.
Holy crap. I think this one text just
gave me enough confidence to send him
another song. I never would have
predicted this. I never imagined I would
be excited.
“Food’s here,” Tori says. “You want
to eat out here?”
I tear my gaze away from the phone
and look at her. “Uh. Yeah. Sure.”
Tori brings the food out to the
balcony. “I’ve never really looked at
that guy before, but damn,” she says,
staring hard at Ridge while he plays his
guitar. “He’s really hot, and I don’t even
like blonds.”
“His hair isn’t blond. It’s brown.”
“No, that’s blond,” she says. “But it’s
dark blond, so that’s okay, I guess.
Almost brown, maybe. I like the messy
shag, and that body makes up for the fact
that his hair isn’t black.” Tori takes a
drink and leans back in her chair, still
staring at him. “Maybe I’m being too
picky. What do I care what color his hair
is? It’ll be dark when I have my hands in
it, anyway.”
I shake my head. “He’s really
talented,” I say. I still haven’t responded
to his text, but he doesn’t seem to be
waiting around. He’s watching his hands
as he plays, not paying a bit of attention
to us.
“I wonder if he’s single,” Tori says.
“I’d like to see what other talents he
has.”
I have no idea if he’s single, but the
way Tori is thinking about him makes my
stomach turn. Tori is incredibly cute,
and I know she could find out if he had
other talents if she really wanted to. She
tends to get whomever she wants in the
guy department. I’ve never really
minded until now.
“You don’t want to be involved with
a musician,” I say, as if I have any
experience that would qualify me to give
her advice. “Besides, I’m pretty sure
Ridge does have a girlfriend. I saw a
girl on his patio with him a few weeks
ago.” That’s technically not a lie. I did
see one once.
Tori glances at me. “You know his
name? How do you know his name?”
I shrug as if it’s no big deal. Because,
honestly, it is no big deal. “He needed
help with lyrics last week, so I texted
him some.”
She sits up in her chair. “You know
his phone number?”
I suddenly become defensive, not
liking the accusatory tone in her voice.
“Calm down, Tori. I don’t even know
him. All I did was text him a few
lyrics.”
She laughs. “I’m not judging, Syd,”
she says, holding up her hands in
defense. “I don’t care how much you
love Hunter, if you have an opening with
that”—she flicks her hand in Ridge’s
direction—“I’d be livid if you didn’t
take advantage of it.”
I roll my eyes. “You know I’d never
do that to Hunter.”
She sighs and leans back in her chair.
“Yeah. I know.”
We’re both looking at Ridge when he
finishes the song. He picks up his phone
and types something, then picks up his
guitar just as my phone vibrates and he
begins to play another song.
Tori reaches for my phone, but I grab
it first and hold it out of her reach.
“That’s from him, isn’t it?” she says. I
read the text.
Ridge: When Barbie goes away, I
want more.
I cringe, because there’s no way I’m
letting Tori read this text. For one thing,
he insulted her. Also, the second part of
his text would have an entirely different
meaning if she read it. I hit delete and
press the power button down to lock my
phone in case she snatches it away from
me.“You’re flirting,” she says teasingly.
She picks up her empty plate and stands
up. “Have fun with your sexting.”
Ugh. I hate that she thinks I’d ever do
that to Hunter. I’ll worry about setting
her straight later, though. In the
meantime, I take out my notebook and
find the page with the lyrics I wrote to
the song he’s currently playing. I transfer
them to a text, hit send, and hurry back
inside.
“That was so good,” I say as I place
my plate in the sink. “That’s probably
my favorite Italian restaurant in all of
Austin.” I walk to the couch and fall
down next to Tori, trying to appear
casual about the fact that she thinks I’m
cheating on Hunter. The more defensive
I get about it, the less likely she’ll be to
believe me when I try to deny it.
“Oh, my God, that reminds me,” she
says. “The funniest thing happened a
couple of weeks ago at this Italian
restaurant. I was eating lunch with . . .
my mom, and we were out on the patio.
Our waiter was telling us about dessert,
when all of a sudden, this cop car comes
screeching around the corner, sirens
blaring . . .”
I’m holding my breath, scared to hear
the rest of her story.
What the hell? Hunter said he was
with a coworker. The odds of them both
being at the same restaurant, without
being there together, is way more than
coincidental.
But why would they lie about being
together?
My heart is folding in on itself. I think
I’m gonna be sick.
How could they . . .
“Syd? Are you okay?” Tori is looking
at me with genuine concern. “You look
like you’re about to be sick.”
I put my hand over my mouth, because
I’m afraid she might be right. I can’t
answer her right away. I can’t even work
up the strength to look at her. I try to still
my hand, but I can feel it trembling
against my mouth.
Why would they be together and not
tell me? They’re never together without
me. They’d have no reason to be
together unless they were planning
something.
Planning something.
Oh.
Wait a second.
I press my palm against my forehead
and shake my head back and forth. I feel
as if I’m in the midst of the stupidest
moment in all of my nearly twenty-two
years of existence. Of course they were
together. Of course they’re hiding
something. It’s my birthday next
Saturday.
Not only do I feel incredibly stupid
for having believed they would do
something like that to me, but I feel
unforgivably guilty.
“You okay?” Tori says.
I nod. “Yeah.” I decide not to mention
the fact that I know she was with Hunter.
I would feel even worse if I ruined their
surprise. “I think the Italian food is just
making me a little nauseated. I’ll be right
back.” I stand and walk to my bedroom,
then sit on the edge of my bed in order to
regain my bearings. I’m filled with a
mixture of doubt and guilt. Doubt,
because I know neither of them would
do what I briefly thought they had done.
Guilt, because for a brief moment, I
actually believed they were capable of
it.
Ridge
I was hoping the first set of lyrics wasn’t
a fluke, but after seeing the second set
she sent me and adding them to the
music, I text Brennan. I can’t not tell him
about her any longer.
Me: I’m about to send you two songs. I
don’t even need you to tell me what
you think of them, because I know
you’ll love them. So let’s move past
that, because I need you to solve a
dilemma for me.
Brennan: Oh, shit. I was just kidding
about the Maggie thing. You didn’t
really dump her for inspiration did
you?
Me: I’m being serious. I found a girl
who I’m positive was brought to this
earth specifically for us.
Brennan: Sorry, man. I’m not into that
shit. I mean, maybe if you weren’t my
brother, but still.
Me: Stop with the horseshit, Brennan.
Her lyrics. They’re perfect. And they
come so effortlessly to her. I think we
need her. I haven’t been able to write
songs like these since . . . well, ever.
Her lyrics are perfect, and you need to
take a look at them, because I sort of
need you to love them and agree to
buy them from her.
Brennan: What the hell, Ridge? We
can’t hire someone to write lyrics for
us. She’ll want a percentage of the
royalties, and between the two of us
and the guys in the band, it won’t be
worth it.
Me: I’m going to ignore that until you
check the e-mail I just sent you.
I put my phone down and pace the
room, giving him time to take a look at
what I just sent him. My heart is
pounding, and I’m sweating, even though
it’s not at all hot in this room. I just can’t
take his telling me no, because I’m
scared that if we can’t use her, I’ll be
facing another six months of a concrete
wall.
After several minutes, my phone
vibrates. I drop to my bed and pick it up.
Brennan: Okay. See what she’s willing
to take, and let me know.
I smile and toss the phone into the air
and feel like yelling. After I calm down
enough to text her, I pick up my phone
and think. I don’t want to freak her out,
because I know she’s completely new to
this kind of thing.
Me: I was wondering if we could talk
sometime soon? I have a proposition
for you. And get your mind out of the
gutter, it’s completely music-related.
Sydney: Okay. I can’t say I’m looking
forward to it, because it makes me
nervous. You want me to call you when
I get off work?
Me: You work?
Sydney: Yes. Campus library.
Morning shift mostly, except for this
weekend.
Me: Oh. I guess that’s why I never
noticed. I don’t usually get out of bed
until after lunch.
Sydney: So do you want me to call
you after I get home?
Me: Just text me. You think we can
meet up sometime this weekend?
Sydney: Probably, but I’d have to talk
to my boyfriend. Don’t want him to find
out and think you’re using me for more
than my lyrics.
Me: K. Sounds good.
Sydney: If you want, you could come
to my birthday party tomorrow night.
Might be easier, because he’ll be here.
Me: It’s your birthday tomorrow?
Happy early birthday. And that sounds
good. What time?
Sydney: Not sure. I’m not supposed to
know about it. I’ll just text you tomorrow
night once I find out more.
Me: K.
Honestly, I don’t like the fact that her
boyfriend might be there. I want to talk
to her about it alone, because I still
haven’t decided what to do about what I
know is going on between that asshole
and her roommate. But I need her to
agree to help me before her heart gets
shattered, so maybe my silence has been
a little selfish. I do admire the fact that
she wants to be honest with him, even
though he doesn’t deserve it. Which
makes me think maybe this is something I
should bring up to Maggie, even though
it never occurred to me before that it
might even remotely be an issue.
Me: Hey. How’s my girl?
Maggie: Busy. This thesis is kicking
my ass. How’s my guy?
Me: Good. Really good. I think
Brennan and I found someone who’s
willing to write lyrics with us. She’s
really good, and I’ve already finished
almost two songs since you left last
weekend.
Maggie: Ridge, that’s great! I can’t wait
to read them. Maybe next weekend?
Me: You coming here, or am I going to
you?
Maggie: I’ll come there. I need to
spend some time at the nursing home.
Love you.
Me: Love you. Don’t forget our video
chat tonight.
Maggie: You know I won’t. Already
have my outfit picked out.
Me: That better be a cruel joke. You
know I don’t care to see clothes.
Maggie: ;)
Eight more hours.
I’m hungry.
I toss the phone aside. I pull open my
bedroom door and take a step back when
the shit that’s been piled up on the other
side begins to fall in on me. First it’s the
lamp, then the end table it was resting
on, then the end table the lamp and the
other end table were piled on top of.
Dammit, Warren.
These pranks are starting to get out of
hand. I press my arm into the couch
that’s been shoved up against my
bedroom door. I push it back out into the
living room and jump over it, then head
toward the kitchen.
• • •
I carefully spoon toothpaste onto an
Oreo, then replace the top of the cookie
and gently squeeze it. I put it back into
the package with the rest of Warren’s
Oreos and seal the package shut, just as
my phone vibrates.
Sydney: Can you do me a favor?
She has no idea how many favors I’d
do for her right now. I’m pretty much at
her mercy.
Me: What’s up?
Sydney: Can you look out your
balcony door and tell me if you see
anything suspicious going on at my
apartment?
Shit. Does she know? What does she
want me to tell her? I know it’s selfish,
but I really don’t want to tell her about
her boyfriend until after I have the
chance to talk to her about the lyrics.
Me: Okay. Hold on.
I walk to my balcony and glance
across the courtyard. I don’t see anything
out of the ordinary. It’s almost dark,
though, so I can’t see much. I’m not sure
what she wants me to find, so I choose
not to be too descriptive when I respond.
Me: Looks quiet.
Sydney: Really? Are the blinds open?
You don’t see people?
I look again. The blinds are open, but
the only thing I can see from here is the
glare from the TV.
Me: Doesn’t look like anyone’s home.
Aren’t you having a birthday party later
tonight?
Sydney: I thought so. I’m really
confused.
There’s movement in one of the
windows, and I see her roommate going
into the living room. Sydney’s boyfriend
follows closely behind her, and they
both sit on the couch, but all I can see is
their feet.
Me: Wait. Your boyfriend and your
roommate just sat on the couch.
Sydney: Okay. Sorry to bother you.
Me: Wait. What about tonight? Are
you still having a birthday party?
Sydney: I don’t know. Hunter says
he’s taking me out to eat as soon as I
get home from work, but I sort of
thought it was a lie. I know he and Tori
had lunch together a couple of weeks
ago, but they don’t know I know. They
were obviously planning something,
and I assumed it was a surprise party,
but tonight’s the only night that could
happen.
I wince. She actually caught them in a
lie, and she thought they were together
because they were planning something
nice for her. Christ. I don’t even know
the guy, and I have a huge urge to walk
over there and beat the shit out of him.
It’s her birthday. I can’t tell her on her
birthday. I take a deep breath, then
decide to text Maggie for advice.
Me: Question. You busy?
Maggie: Nope. Shoot.
Me: If it was your birthday and
someone you knew found out I was
cheating on you, would you want to
know right then? Or would you hope
that person would wait to tell you until it
was no longer your birthday?
Maggie: If this is a hypothetical
question, I’m going to kill you for this
heart attack. If it’s not hypothetical, I’m
going to kill you for this heart attack.
Me: You know it’s not me. It’s not your
birthday. ;)
Maggie: Who’s cheating on whom?
Me: It’s Sydney’s birthday today. The
girl I was telling you about who writes
the lyrics. I happen to know her
boyfriend is cheating on her, and I’m
kind of in a position where I should tell
her because she’s becoming
suspicious.
Maggie: Jesus. I’d hate to be you right
now. But if she’s suspicious and you
know for a fact that he’s cheating, you
need to tell her, Ridge. If you don’t say
anything, you’re inadvertently lying.
Me: Ugh! That’s what I thought you’d
say.
Maggie: Good luck. I’m still going to kill
you for the heart attack next weekend.
I sit on the bed, then start a text to
Sydney.
Me: I’m not sure how to say this,
Sydney. You’re not driving right now,
are you?
Sydney: Oh, jeez. There are people
there, aren’t there? Lots of them?
Me: No, there isn’t anyone there but
the two of them. First, I need to
apologize for not telling you this
sooner. I didn’t know how, because we
don’t know each other that well.
Second, I’m sorry for doing it on your
birthday, of all days, but I feel like an
ass for even waiting this long. And
third, I’m sorry you have to find out via
text, but I don’t want you to have to
walk back into your apartment without
knowing the truth first.
Sydney: You’re scaring me, Ridge.
Me: I’m just going to rip the Band-Aid
off, okay? Something has been going
on between your roommate and your
boyfriend for a while.
I hit send and close my eyes, knowing
I’m completely ruining her birthday. If
not pretty much every day after today,
too.
Sydney: Ridge, they’ve been friends
for longer than I’ve even known
Hunter. I think you’ve misinterpreted
everything.
Me: If sticking your tongue down
someone’s throat while straddling him
is friendship, then I’m sorry. But I’m
positive I’m not misinterpreting
anything. It’s been going on for weeks.
I’m assuming they come out to the
patio while you’re in the shower,
because they’re never out there long.
But it happens a lot.
Sydney: If you’re being honest, why
didn’t you tell me when we first started
talking?
Me: How does one comfortably say
this to another person, Sydney? When
is there ever an appropriate time? I’m
telling you now because you’re
becoming suspicious, and it’s as
appropriate a time as it can be.
Sydney: Please tell me you have a
warped sense of humor, because you
have no idea what you’re doing to my
heart right now.
Me: I’m sorry, Sydney. Really.
I wait patiently for a response. She
doesn’t text me back. I contemplate
texting her, but I know she needs time to
absorb this.
Dammit, I’m such an asshole. Now
she’ll probably be pissed at me, but I
can’t blame her. I guess I can kiss the
lyrics good-bye.
My door swings open, and Warren
barges in, then hurls a cookie straight at
me. I duck, and it hits the headboard
behind me.
“Asshole!” Warren yells. He turns
and marches back out of the bedroom
and slams the door.
Chapter Four
Sydney
I must be in shock. How the hell did the
day turn out like this? How does one girl
go from having a best friend, a
boyfriend, a purse, and a roof over her
head to being heartbroken and naked,
standing frozen in a strange shower,
staring at the wall for half an hour
straight? I swear to God, if this is some
huge elaborate birthday hoax at my
expense, I’m never speaking to anyone.
Ever again. Ever.
However, I know it’s not a hoax. A
hoax is just wishful thinking. I knew the
second I walked through the front door
and headed straight for Hunter that
everything Ridge had said was true. I
flat-out asked Hunter if he was sleeping
with Tori, and the looks on both of their
faces would have been comical if they
didn’t completely crush my heart and
deplete my trust in one fell swoop. I
wanted to sink to the floor and cry when
he couldn’t deny it. Instead, I walked
calmly to my bedroom and began
packing my things.
Tori came into the room, crying. She
tried to tell me it meant nothing, that sex
had always been a casual thing between
them, even before they met me. Hearing
her say it meant nothing to them hurt
worse than anything. If it meant
something to either of them, at least I
could vaguely understand their betrayal.
But the fact that she was claiming it
meant nothing, yet it still happened, hurt
me more than anything else she could
have possibly said at that moment. I’m
pretty sure that’s when I punched her.
It doesn’t help matters that I lost my
job just minutes after Ridge told me
about Hunter and Tori. I think it’s
frowned upon in most libraries when
student workers begin crying and
throwing books at the wall in the middle
of their shift. But I can’t help the fact that
I happened to be stocking the romance
section the second I found out my
boyfriend of two years was sleeping
with my roommate. The sappy, romantic
covers on the cart in front of me just
really pissed me off.
I turn the water off in Ridge’s shower
and step out, then get dressed.
I feel better physically after finally
getting into dry clothes, but my heart is
growing heavier and heavier with each
passing minute. The more time that
passes by, the more my reality begins to
sink in. In the course of just two hours,
I’ve lost the entire last two years of my
life. That’s a lot of time to invest in two
people who were supposed to be the
most trusted people in my life. I’m not
sure if I would have ended up marrying
Hunter or if he would have been the
father of any future children of mine, but
it hurts to know that I trusted him enough
to possibly fill those roles, and he ended
up being the opposite of who I thought he
was.
I think the fact that I misjudged him
pisses me off more than the fact that he
cheated on me. If I can’t even accurately
judge the people closest to me, then I
can’t trust anyone. Ever. I hate them for
taking that away from me. Now, no
matter who comes into my life after this,
I’ll always be skeptical.
I walk back into the living room, and
all the lights are out except for a lamp
beside the couch. I look at my phone,
and it’s barely after nine. Several texts
came through while I was in the shower,
so I take a seat on the couch and scroll
through them.
Hunter: Please call me. We need to
talk.
Tori: I’m not mad at you for hitting me.
Please call me.
Hunter: I’m worried about you. Where
are you?
Ridge: I’m sorry I didn’t tell you
sooner. Are you okay?
Hunter: I’ll bring your purse to you.
Just tell me where you are.
I drop the phone onto the coffee table
and sink back onto the couch. I have no
idea what I’m going to do. Of course, I
never want to speak to either of them
again, but where does that put me? I
can’t afford my own apartment right
now, since financial aid doesn’t come in
for another month. I don’t have enough
money in savings to put down a deposit
plus get all the utilities turned on until
then. The majority of the friends I’ve
made since I’ve been going to school
here still live in dorms, so staying with
them is out of the question. I’m basically
left with two options: Call my parents,
or enter into some odd plural
relationship with Hunter and Tori in
order to save money.
Neither option is one I’m willing to
entertain tonight. I’m just thankful that
Ridge allowed me to stay at his place.
At least I’m saving money on a hotel
room. I have no idea where I’ll go when
I wake up in the morning, but that’s still
a good twelve hours away. Until then,
I’ll just continue to hate the entire
universe while I feel sorry for myself.
And what better way to feel sorry for
myself than while getting drunk?
I need alcohol. Bad.
I walk to the kitchen and begin to scan
the cabinets. I hear the door to Ridge’s
bedroom open. I glance over my
shoulder at him as he comes out of his
room.
His hair is definitely light brown.
Take that, Tori.
He’s in a faded T-shirt and jeans, and
he’s barefoot, eyeing me inquisitively as
he makes his way into the kitchen. I feel
a little embarrassed for being caught
rummaging through his cabinets, so I turn
away from him before he sees me blush.
“I need a drink,” I say. “You got any
alcohol?”
He’s staring down at his phone,
texting again. He either can’t do two
things at once, or he’s upset because I
had an attitude with him today.
“I’m sorry if I was a bitch to you,
Ridge, but you have to admit, my
response was a little justified
considering the day I’ve had.”
He casually slips his phone into his
pocket and looks at me from across the
bar, but he chooses not to respond to my
half-assed apology. He purses his lips
and cocks an eyebrow.
I’d like to smack that cocky eyebrow
back down where it belongs. What the
hell is his problem? The worst thing I
did to him was flip him off.
I roll my eyes and shut the last
cabinet, then walk back to the couch.
He’s really being a jerk, considering my
situation. From the little time I’ve known
him, I was under the impression that he
was actually a nice guy, but I’d almost
rather go back to my own apartment with
Tori and Hunter.
I pick up my phone, expecting another
text from Hunter, but it’s from Ridge.
Ridge: If you aren’t going to look at me
when you speak, you might want to
stick to texting.
I read the text several times, trying to
make sense of it, but no matter how many
times I read it, I don’t understand it. I
grow concerned that maybe he’s a little
weird and I need to leave. I look at him,
and he’s watching me. He can see the
confusion on my face, but he still doesn’t
explain himself. Instead, he resumes
texting. When my phone receives another
message, I look at the screen.
Ridge: I’m deaf, Sydney.
Deaf?
Oh.
Wait. Deaf?
But how? We’ve had so many
conversations.
The last few weeks of knowing him
and talking to him flash through my
memory, and I can’t recall a single time
I’ve actually heard him speak.
Is that why Bridgette thought I was
deaf?
I stare at my phone, sinking into a
heap of embarrassment. I’m not sure
how to feel about this. I’m sure that
feeling betrayed isn’t a fair response, but
I can’t help it. I feel I need to tack this
onto the “Ways the world can betray
Sydney on her birthday” list. Not only
did he not tell me he knew my boyfriend
was screwing around on me, but he also
failed to mention that he’s deaf?
Not that being deaf is something he
should feel obliged to tell me. I just . . . I
don’t know. I feel a little hurt that he
didn’t share that fact with me.
Me: Why didn’t you tell me you were
deaf?
Ridge: Why didn’t you tell me you
could hear?
I tilt my head as I read his text and
flood with even more humiliation. He
makes a very good point.
Oh, well. At least he won’t hear me
cry myself to sleep tonight.
Me: Do you have any alcohol?
Ridge reads my text and laughs, then
nods. He walks to the cabinet below the
sink and pulls out a container of Pine-
Sol. He takes two glasses out of the
cabinet, then proceeds to fill them with .
. . cleaning liquid?
“What the hell are you doing?” I ask.
When he doesn’t turn around, I slap
myself in the forehead, remembering he
can’t hear me. This will take some
getting used to. I walk to where he’s
standing. When he sets the Pine-Sol
down on the counter and picks up both
glasses, I grab the bottle of cleaning
solution and read it, then arch an
eyebrow. He laughs and hands me a
glass. He sniffs his drink, then motions
for me to do the same. I hesitantly bring
it to my nose and am met with the
burning scent of whiskey. He holds the
glass out, clinks it to mine, and we both
down our shots. I’m still recovering
from the awful taste when he picks up
his phone and texts me again.
Ridge: Our other roommate has an
issue with alcohol, so we have to hide
it from him.
Me: Is his issue that he hates it?
Ridge: His issue is that he doesn’t like
to pay for it himself and he drinks
everyone else’s.
I nod, set my phone back down, grab
the container, and pour us each another
shot. We repeat the motions, downing
the second one. I grimace as the burn
spreads its way down my throat and
through my chest. I shake my head, then
open my eyes.
“Can you read lips?” I ask.
He shrugs, then grabs a piece of paper
and a pen conveniently placed on the
counter next to him. Depends on the
lips.
I guess that makes sense. “Can you
read mine?”
He nods and takes the pen again.
Mostly. I’ve learned to anticipate what
people are going to say more than
anything. I take most of my cues from
body language and the situations I’m
in.
“What do you mean?” I ask, pushing
on the counter with my palms and
hopping up onto the bar. I’ve never met
anyone who couldn’t hear before. I
didn’t realize I was full of so many
questions. It could be that I’m already
feeling a buzz or I just don’t want him to
go back to his room yet. I don’t want to
be left alone to think about Hunter and
Tori.
Ridge sets the notepad down and
picks up my phone, then tosses it to me.
He pulls one of the bar stools out and
sits on it next to where I’m seated on the
counter.
Ridge: If I’m at the store and a cashier
speaks to me, I can mostly guess what
they’re asking. Same thing with a
waitress at a restaurant. It’s pretty
simple to gather what people are
saying when it’s a routine
conversation.
Me: But what about right now? This
isn’t routine. I doubt you have many
homeless girls spend the night on your
couch, so how do you know what I’m
saying?
Ridge: Because you’re basically
asking me the same questions as
anyone else who initially finds out I
can’t hear. It’s the same conversation,
just different people.
This comment bothers me, because I
don’t want to seem like those kinds of
people at all. It has to get old, having to
field the same questions over and over.
Me: Well, I don’t really want to know
about it, then. Let’s change the
subject.
Ridge looks up at me and smiles.
Damn. I don’t know if it’s the whiskey
or the fact that I’ve been single for two
hours, but that smile does some serious
flirting with my stomach.
Ridge: Let’s talk about music.
“Okay,” I say with a nod.
Ridge: I wanted to talk to you about
this tonight. You know, before I ruined
your life and all that. I want you to
write lyrics for my band. For the songs
I have written and maybe some future
songs if you’re up for it.
I pause before responding to him. My
initial response is to ask him about his
band, because I’ve been dying to see this
guy perform. My second response is to
ask him how the hell he can play a guitar
if he can’t hear, but again, I don’t want
to be one of “those people.” My third
response is to automatically say no,
because agreeing to give someone lyrics
is a lot of pressure. Pressure I don’t
really want right now, since my life has
pretty much taken a nosedive today.
I shake my head. “No. I don’t think I
want to do that.”
Ridge: We would pay you.
That gets my attention. I suddenly feel
an option three making its way into the
picture.
Me: What kind of pay are we talking
about? I still think you’re insane for
wanting me to help you write lyrics, but
you may have caught me at a very
desperate and destitute moment, being
as though I’m homeless and could use
some extra money.
Ridge: Why do you keep referring to
yourself as homeless? Do you not
have a place to stay?
Me: Well, I could stay with my parents,
but that would mean I’d have to
transfer schools my senior year, and it
would put me about two semesters
behind. I could also stay with my
roommate, but I don’t know how much
I’d like to hear her screwing my
boyfriend of two years at night while I
try to sleep.
Ridge: You’re a smartass.
Me: Yeah, I guess I’ve got that going
for me.
Ridge: You can stay here. We’re kind
of in search of a fourth roommate. If it
means you’ll help us with the songs,
you can stay for free until you get
back on your feet.
I read the text twice, slowly. I shake
my head.
Ridge: Just until you can get your own
place.
Me: No. I don’t even know you.
Besides, your Hooters girlfriend
already hates me.
Ridge laughs at that comment.
Ridge: Bridgette is not my girlfriend.
And she’s hardly ever here, so you
don’t have to worry about her.
Me: This is too weird.
Ridge: What other option do you
have? I saw you didn’t even have cab
fare earlier. You’re pretty much at my
mercy.
Me: I have cab fare. I left my purse in
my apartment, and I didn’t want to go
back up to get it, so I didn’t have a
way to pay the driver.
Ridge frowns when he reads my text.
Ridge: I’ll go with you to get it if you
need it.
I look up at him. “Are you sure?” I
ask. He smiles and walks toward the front
door, so I follow him.
Ridge
It’s still raining out, and I know she just
put on dry clothes after her shower, so
once we reach the bottom of the
stairwell, I pull my phone out and text
her.
Me: Wait here so you don’t get wet
again. I’ll go get it myself.
She reads the text and shakes her
head, then looks back up at me. “No. I’m
going with you.”
I can’t help but appreciate the fact that
she doesn’t respond to my being deaf the
way I expect her to. Most people
become uneasy once they aren’t sure
how to communicate with me. The
majority of them raise their voices and
talk slowly, sort of like Bridgette. I
guess they think being louder will
somehow miraculously make me hear
again. However, it does nothing but
force me to contain my laughter while
they talk to me as if I’m an idiot.
Granted, I know people don’t do it to be
disrespectful. It’s just simple ignorance,
and that’s fine. I’m so used to it I don’t
even notice anymore.
However, I did notice Sydney’s
reaction . . . because there really wasn’t
one. As soon as she found out, she just
propped herself up on the counter and
continued talking to me, even though she
moved from speaking to texting. And it
helps that she’s a fast texter.
We run across the courtyard until we
reach the base of the stairs that lead up
to her apartment. I begin walking up and
notice that she’s frozen at the bottom of
the stairs. The look in her eyes is
nervous, and I instantly feel bad for not
realizing how hard this must be for her. I
know she’s probably hurting a lot more
than she’s letting on. Learning that your
best friend and your boyfriend have
betrayed you has to be difficult, and it
hasn’t even been a day since she found
out. I walk back down the stairs and
grab her hand, then smile at her
reassuringly. I tug on her hand; she takes
a deep breath and walks with me up the
stairs. She taps me on the shoulder
before we reach her door, and I turn
around.
“Can I wait here?” she says. “I don’t
want to see them.”
I nod, relieved that her lips are easy
to read.
“But cow well you ass therefore my
bird?” she says.
Or I think that’s what she said. I
laugh, knowing I more than likely
completely misread her lips. She says it
again when she sees the confusion on my
face, but I still don’t understand her. I
hold up my phone so she can text me.
Sydney: But how will you ask them for
my purse?
Yeah. I was a little off on that one.
Me: I’ll get your purse, Sydney. Wait
here.
She nods. I type out a text as I walk to
the front door and knock. A minute
passes, and no one comes to the door, so
I knock again, with more force, thinking
maybe my first knock was too soft to be
heard. The doorknob turns, and Sydney’s
friend appears in the doorway. She eyes
me curiously for a second, then glances
behind her. The door opens wider, and
Hunter appears, eyeing me suspiciously.
He says something that looks like “Can I
help you?” I hold up the text that says
I’m here for Sydney’s purse, and he
looks down and reads it, then shakes his
head.
“Who the hell are you?” he says,
apparently not liking the fact that I’m
here on Sydney’s behalf. The girl
disappears from the doorway, and he
opens the door even farther, then folds
his arms over his chest and glares at me.
I motion to my ear and shake my head,
letting him know that I can’t hear what
he’s saying.
He pauses, then throws his head back
and laughs and disappears from the
doorway. I glance to Sydney, who is
standing nervously at the top of the
stairs, watching me. Her face is pale,
and I give her a wink, letting her know
everything is okay. Hunter comes back,
slaps a piece of paper against the door,
and writes on it. He holds the paper up
for me to read.
Are you fucking her?
Jesus, what a prick. I motion for the
pen and paper, and he hands them to me.
I write my response and hand it back to
him. He looks down at the paper, and his
jaw tightens. He crumples up the paper,
drops it to the floor, and then, before I
can react, his fist is coming at me.
I accept the hit, knowing I should have
been prepared for it. The girl reappears,
and I can tell she’s screaming, although I
have no idea whom she’s screaming at
or what she’s saying. As soon as I take a
step back from the doorway, Sydney is
in front of me, rushing into the apartment.
My eyes follow her as she runs down the
hallway, disappears into a room, and
comes back out clutching a purse. The
girl steps in front of her and places her
hands on Sydney’s shoulders, but Sydney
pulls her arm back, makes a fist, and
punches the girl in the face.
Hunter tries to step in front of Sydney
to block her from leaving, so I tap him
on the shoulder. When he turns around, I
punch him square in the nose, and he
stumbles back. Sydney’s eyes go wide,
and she looks back at me. I grab her
hand and pull her out of the apartment,
toward the stairs.
Luckily, the rain has finally stopped,
so we both break into a run back toward
my apartment. I glance behind me a
couple of times to make sure neither of
them is following us. Once we make it
back across the courtyard and up my
stairs, I swing open the door and step
aside so she can run in. I shut the door
behind us and bend over, clasping my
knees with my hands to catch my breath.
What an asshole. I’m not sure what
Sydney saw in him, but the fact that she
dated him makes me question her
judgment a little bit.
I glance up at her, expecting to see her
in tears, but instead, she’s laughing.
She’s sitting on the floor, attempting to
catch her breath, laughing hysterically. I
can’t help but smile, seeing her reaction.
And the fact that she punched that girl
right in the face without a moment’s
hesitation? I’ve got to hand it to her,
she’s tougher than I first thought.
She looks up at me and inhales a
calming breath, then mouths the words
thank you, while holding up her purse.
She stands up and brushes the wet hair
out of her face, then walks to the kitchen
and opens a few drawers until she finds
a dishtowel and pulls it out. She wets it
under the faucet, turns around, and
motions me over. When I reach her, I
lean against the counter while she takes
my chin and angles my face to the left.
She presses the towel to my lip, and I
wince. I didn’t even realize it was
hurting until she touched it. She pulls the
rag back, and there’s blood on it, so she
rinses it under the faucet and puts it back
up to my mouth. I notice that her own
hand is red. I take it and inspect it. It’s
already swelling.
I pull the rag from her hand and wipe
the rest of the blood off my face, then
grab a ziplock bag out of the cabinet, go
to the freezer, and fill it with ice. I take
her hand and press the ice onto it, letting
her know she needs to keep it there. I
lean against the counter next to her and
pull my phone out.
Me: You hit her good. Your hand is
already swelling.
She texts me with one hand, keeping
the ice on top of the other as she rests it
on the counter.
Sydney: It could be because that
wasn’t the first time I’ve punched her
today. Or it could also be swollen
because you aren’t the first one to
punch Hunter today.
Me: Wow. I’m impressed. Or terrified.
Is three punches your daily average?
Sydney: Three punches is now my
lifetime average.
I laugh.
She shrugs and sets her phone down,
then pulls the ice off her hand and brings
it back up to my mouth. “Your lip is
swelling,” she says.
My hands are clenching the countertop
behind me. I become increasingly uneasy
with how comfortable she is with all
this. Thoughts of Maggie flash through
my head, and I can’t help but wonder if
she’d be okay with this scenario if she
were to walk through the front door right
now.
I need a distraction.
Me: You want birthday cake?
She smiles and nods.
Me: I probably shouldn’t drive, since
you’ve turned me into a raging
alcoholic tonight, but if you feel like
walking, Park’s Diner makes a damn
good dessert, and it’s less than a mile
from here. Pretty sure the rain is over.
“Let me change,” she says, motioning
to her clothes. She pulls clothes from her
suitcase, then heads to the bathroom. I
put the top on the Pine-Sol and hide it
back under the cabinet.
Chapter Five
Sydney
We don’t interact much while we eat.
We’re both sitting in the booth with our
backs to the wall and our legs stretched
out in front of us on the seats. We’re
quietly watching the restaurant crowd,
and I can’t stop wondering what it’s like
for him, not being able to hear anything
going on around us. I’m probably too
blunt for my own good, but I have to ask
him what’s on my mind.
Me: What’s being deaf like? Do you
feel like you’re in on a secret that no
one else knows about? Like you have
a leg up on everyone because the fact
that you can’t hear has magnified all
your other senses and you’ve got
superhuman powers and no one can
tell just by looking at you?
He almost spits out his drink while
reading my text. He laughs, and it occurs
to me that his laugh is the only sound
I’ve heard him make. I know that some
people who can’t hear can still talk, but I
haven’t heard him say a single word all
night. Not even to the waitress. He either
points to what he wants on the menu or
writes it down.
Ridge: I can honestly say I’ve never
thought about it like that before. I kind
of like it that you think of it that way,
though. To be honest, I don’t think
about it at all. It’s normal to me. I have
nothing to compare it to, because it’s
all I’ve ever known.
Me: I’m sorry. I’m being one of those
people again, aren’t I? I guess me
asking you to compare being deaf to
not being deaf is like you asking me to
compare being a girl to being a boy.
Ridge: Don’t apologize. I like that
you’re interested enough to ask me
about it. Most people are a little
weirded out by it, so they don’t say
anything at all. I’ve noticed it’s kind of
hard to make friends, but that’s also a
good thing. The few friends I do have
are genuine, so I look at it as an easy
way of weeding out all the shallow,
ignorant assholes.
Me: Good to know I’m not a shallow,
ignorant asshole.
Ridge: Wish I could say the same
about your ex.
I sigh. Ridge is right, but damn if it
doesn’t sting to know I couldn’t see
through Hunter’s bullshit.
I put my phone down and eat the last
of my cake. “Thank you,” I say as I put
my fork down. I honestly forgot for a
while that today was my birthday until
he offered to take me out for cake.
He shrugs as if it isn’t a big deal, but
it is a big deal. I can’t believe after the
day I’ve had that I’m actually in a
semidecent mood. Ridge can take credit
for that, because if it weren’t for him, I
don’t know where I’d be tonight or what
kind of emotional state I’d be in.
He takes a drink of his soda, then sits
upright in the booth. He nods his head to
the door, and I agree that I’m ready to
go.
The buzz from the alcohol has worn
off, and as we make our way out of the
restaurant and back into the dark, I can
feel myself beginning to succumb to the
heartache again. I guess Ridge sees the
look on my face, because he puts his arm
around me and briefly squeezes my
shoulders. He drops his arm and pulls
his phone out.
Ridge: For what it’s worth, he doesn’t
deserve you.
Me: I know. But it still hurts that I ever
thought he deserved me. And honestly,
I’m more hurt about Tori than I am
about what happened with Hunter. I’m
mostly just pissed at Hunter.
Ridge: Yeah, I don’t even know the
guy, and I’ve been pretty pissed at
him. I can’t imagine how you must
feel. I’m surprised you haven’t
retaliated with some evil revenge plot
yet.
Me: I’m not that clever. I wish I were,
because I’d be all about revenge right
now.
Ridge stops walking and turns to face
me. He cocks an eyebrow, and a slightly
wicked grin appears. It makes me laugh,
because I can tell by his smile that he’s
mapping out a plan.
“Okay,” I say, nodding my head
without even knowing what he’s about to
propose. “As long as it doesn’t land us
in jail.”
Ridge: Do you know if he leaves his
car unlocked?
• • •
“Fish?” I ask, crinkling my nose in
disgust. We’ve made a pit stop at a local
grocery store next to the apartment
complex, and he’s buying a huge, scaly
whole fish. I’m assuming this has to be
part of his elaborate revenge scheme, but
he could just be hungry.
Ridge: We need duct tape.
I follow him to the hardware aisle,
where he grabs a roll of heavy-duty duct
tape.
Fresh fish and duct tape.
I’m still not sure what he has planned,
but I sort of like where this is headed.
• • •
When we’re back at the apartment, I
point out Hunter’s car. I run up to the
apartment to grab his spare car key out
of my purse, where I still have it, while
Ridge wraps the fish with duct tape. I
come back downstairs and hand him the
key.
Me: So what exactly are we about to
do with this fish?
Ridge: Watch and learn, Sydney.
We walk to Hunter’s car, and Ridge
unlocks the passenger door. He has me
tear off several pieces of duct tape while
he reaches under the passenger seat. I’m
watching closely—in case I need to seek
revenge against anyone in the future—
and he presses it against the underside of
the seat. I hand him several more pieces
of duct tape, trying to contain my
laughter while he secures the raw fish
with it. After he’s sure it won’t come
loose, he slides out of the car and closes
the door, looking around innocently. My
hand is over my mouth, stifling my
laughter, and he’s as cool and composed
as can be.
We casually walk away from the car,
and once we’re on the stairs to the
apartment, we begin laughing.
Ridge: His car is going to smell like
death in a matter of twenty-four hours.
He’ll never find it.
Me: You’re kind of evil. If I didn’t know
better, I’d think you’ve done this
before.
He laughs as we make our way back
inside. We kick off our shoes at the
door, and he tosses the duct tape onto the
counter. I use the bathroom and make
sure to unlock the door to his bedroom
before I walk back out. In the living
room, all the lights are out, except for
the lamp by the couch. I lie down and
check my phone one last time before
turning it on silent.
Ridge: Good night. Sorry your
birthday sucked.
Me: Thanks to you, it was better than it
could have been.
I place the phone under my pillow and
cover up. I close my eyes, and my smile
immediately fades when the silence
takes over. I can feel the tears coming,
so I cover my head with the blanket and
brace myself for a long night of
heartache. The respite with Ridge was
nice, but I have nothing to distract me
now from the fact that I’m having the
worst day of my life. I can’t understand
how Tori could do something like this to
me. We’ve been best friends for almost
three years. I told her everything. I
trusted her with everything. I told her
things I would never dream of telling
Hunter.
Why would she risk our friendship for
sex?
I’ve never felt this hurt. I pull the
blanket over my eyes and begin to sob.
Happy birthday to me.
• • •
I have the pillow pulled tightly over my
head, but it doesn’t drown out the sound
of gravel crunching beneath shoes. Why
is someone walking on a driveway so
noisily? And why can I even hear it?
Wait. Where am I?
Did yesterday really happen?
I reluctantly open my eyes, and I’m
met with sunlight, so I pull the pillow
tighter over my face and give myself a
minute to adjust. The sound seems to get
louder, so I lift the pillow from my face
and peer out with one eye open. The first
thing I see is a kitchen that isn’t mine.
Oh, yeah. That’s right. I’m on Ridge’s
couch, and twenty-two is the worst age
ever.
I lift the pillow all the way off my
head and groan as I squeeze my eyes shut
again.
“Who are you and why are you
sleeping on my couch?”
My body jumps, and my eyes flick
open at the deep voice that can’t be more
than a foot away. Two eyes peer down
at me. I pull my head back against the
couch to put more space between me and
the curious eyes to get a better look at
who they’re attached to.
It’s a guy. A guy I’ve never seen
before. He’s sitting on the floor directly
in front of the couch, and he’s holding a
bowl. He dips a spoon into the bowl and
shoves it into his mouth, then begins the
loud crunching again. I’m guessing that’s
not gravel he’s eating.
“Are you the new roommate?” he says
with his mouth full.
I shake my head. “No,” I mutter. “I’m
a friend of Ridge’s.”
He cocks his head and looks at me
suspiciously. “Ridge only has one
friend,” the guy says. “Me.” He shoves
another spoonful of cereal into his mouth
and fails to back out of my personal
space.
I push my palms into the couch and sit
up so that he’s not right in my face.
“Jealous?” I ask.
The guy continues to stare at me.
“What’s his last name?”
“Whose last name?”
“Your very good friend, Ridge,” he
says cockily.
I roll my eyes and drop my head
against the back of the couch. I don’t
know who the hell this guy is, but I
really don’t care to compete over our
levels of friendship with Ridge. “I don’t
know Ridge’s last name. I don’t know
his middle name. The only thing I know
about him is that he’s got a mean right
hook. And I’m only sleeping on your
couch because my boyfriend of two
years decided it would be fun to screw
my roommate and I really didn’t want to
stick around to watch.”
He nods, then swallows. “It’s
Lawson. And he doesn’t have a middle
name.”
As if the morning could get any
worse, Bridgette appears from the
hallway and walks into the kitchen.
The guy on the floor takes another
spoonful of cereal and looks at
Bridgette, finally breaking his
uncomfortable lock on me. “Good
morning, Bridgette,” he says with an
odd, sarcastic tone to his voice. “Sleep
well?”
She looks at him briefly and rolls her
eyes. “Screw you, Warren,” she snaps.
He turns his gaze back to mine with a
mischievous grin. “That’s Bridgette,” he
whispers. “She pretends to hate me
during the day, but at night, she loves
me.”
I laugh, not really trusting that
Bridgette is capable of loving anyone.
“Shit!” she yells, catching herself on
the bar before she trips. “Jesus Christ!”
She kicks one of my suitcases, still on
the floor next to the bar. “Tell your little
friend if she’s staying here, she needs to
take her shit to her room!”
Warren makes a face as if he’s scared
for me, then turns his head toward
Bridgette. “What am I, your bitch? Tell
her yourself.”
Bridgette points to the suitcase she
almost tripped over. “GET . . . YOUR . .
. SHIT . . . OUT . . . OF . . . THE . . .
KITCHEN!” she says, before marching
back to her bedroom.
Warren slowly turns his head back to
face me and laughs. “Why does she think
you’re deaf?”
I shrug. “I have no idea. She came to
that conclusion last night, and I failed to
correct her.”
He laughs again, much louder. “Oh,
this is classic,” he says. “Do you have
any pets?”
I shake my head.
“Are you opposed to porn?”
I don’t know how we just began
playing Twenty Questions, but I answer
him anyway. “Not opposed to the
principle of porn but opposed to being
featured in one.”
He nods, contemplating my answer for
a beat too long. “Do you have annoying
friends?”
I shake my head. “My best friend is a
backstabbing whore, and I’m no longer
speaking to her.”
“What are your showering habits?”
I laugh. “Once a day, with a skipped
day every now and then. No more than
fifteen minutes.”
“Do you cook?”
“Only when I’m hungry.”
“Do you clean up after yourself?”
“Probably better than you,” I say,
taking in the fact that he’s used his shirt
for a napkin no fewer than three times
during this conversation.
“Do you listen to disco?”
“I’d rather eat barbed wire.”
“All right, then,” he says. “I guess you
can stay.”
I pull my feet up and sit cross-legged.
“I didn’t realize I was being
interviewed.”
He glances at my suitcases, then back
to me. “It’s obvious you need a place to
stay, and we’ve got an empty room. If
you don’t take it, Bridgette wants to
move her sister in next month, and that’s
the last thing Ridge and I need.”
“I can’t stay here,” I say.
“Why not? From the sound of it,
you’re about to spend the day searching
for an apartment anyway. What’s wrong
with this one? You won’t even have to
walk very far to get here.”
I want to say that Ridge is the
problem. He’s been nice, but I think that
might be the issue. I’ve been single for
less than twenty-four hours, and I don’t
like the fact that although I should have
been consumed with nightmares about
Hunter and Tori all night, instead, I had
a slightly disturbing dream involving an
extremely accommodating Ridge.
I don’t tell Warren that Ridge is why I
can’t stay here, though. Partly because
that would give Warren more
ammunition for questions and partly
because Ridge just walked into the
kitchen and is looking at us.
Warren winks at me, then stands up
and walks with his bowl to the sink. He
looks at Ridge. “Have you met our new
roommate?” Warren asks.
Ridge signs something to him. Warren
shakes his head and signs back. I sit on
the couch and watch their silent
conversation, slightly in awe that
Warren knows sign language. I wonder
if he’s learned it for Ridge’s benefit.
Maybe they’re brothers? Warren laughs,
and Ridge glances in my direction
before walking back to his bedroom.
“What did he say?” I ask, suddenly
worried that Ridge no longer wants me
here.
Warren shrugs and begins walking
back toward his bedroom. “Exactly what
I thought he’d say.” He walks into his
room, then comes back out with a cap on
and keys in his hand. “He said you two
already worked out a deal.” Warren
slips a pair of shoes on by the front
door. “Heading to work now. That’s
your room if you want to put your stuff in
it. You might have to throw all of
Brennan’s shit in the corner, though.” He
opens the door and steps outside, then
turns back around. “Oh. What’s your
name?”
“Sydney.”
“Well, Sydney. Welcome to the
weirdest place you’ll ever live.” He
shuts the door behind him.
I’m not sure I’m comfortable with
this, but what other choice do I have? I
pull my phone out from under my pillow.
I start to text Ridge, because I don’t
recall closing a deal last night regarding
my living arrangements. Before I finish
the text, he sends me one first.
Ridge: Are you okay with this?
Me: Are you?
Ridge: I asked you first.
Me: I guess. But only if you are.
Ridge: Well, then, I guess that means
we’re roommates.
Me: If we’re roommates, can you do
me a favor?
Ridge: What’s that?
Me: If I ever start dating again, don’t
be like Tori and sleep with my
boyfriend, okay?
Ridge: I can’t make any promises.
A few seconds later, he walks out of
his bedroom and goes straight to my
suitcases. He picks them up and carries
them through the other bedroom door. He
opens it and nods his head toward the
room, indicating that I should come with
him. I stand up and follow him into the
bedroom. He lays the suitcases on the
bed, then pulls his phone out again.
Ridge: Brennan still has a lot of stuff in
here. I’ll box it up and put it in the
corner until he can get it all. Other than
that, you might want to change the
sheets.
He shoots me a wary look regarding
the condition of the sheets, and I laugh.
He points to the bathroom.
Ridge: We share the bathroom. Just
lock the main door to the hallway and
both doors to the bedrooms when
you’re in there. I obviously won’t know
when you’re in the shower, so unless
you want me barging in on you, make
sure to lock up.
He walks to the bathroom and flips a
light switch on the outside of the door,
which turns the lights on and off inside
the bathroom, then turns his attention
back to the phone.
Ridge: I added switches on the outside
because it’s an easy way for someone
to get my attention, since I can’t hear
a knock. Just flip the switch if you
need to come into the bathroom so I’ll
know. The whole apartment is set up
this way. There’s a switch outside my
bedroom door that turns my lights on
and off if you need me. But I usually
have my phone on me, so there’s
always texting.
He shows me where clean sheets are
and then cleans out what’s left in the
dresser while I put the new sheets on the
bed.
“Do I need furniture?”
Ridge shakes his head.
Ridge: He’s leaving it. You can use
what’s here.
I nod, taking in the bedroom that has
unexpectedly just become my new home.
I smile at Ridge to let him know I
appreciate his help. “Thank you.”
He smiles back.
Ridge: I’ll be in my room working for
the next few hours if you need
anything. I have to go to the store this
afternoon. You can go with me and get
what you need for the apartment.
He backs out of the bedroom and
gives me a salute. I sit down on the edge
of the bed and salute him back as he
shuts the door. I fall back onto the bed
and let out a huge sigh of relief.
Now that I have a place to live, all I
need is a job. And maybe a car, since
Tori and I mostly shared hers. Then
maybe I’ll call my parents and tell them I
moved.
Or maybe not. I’ll give this place a
couple of weeks in order to see how
things turn out.
Ridge: Oh, and btw, I didn’t write that
on your forehead.
What?
I run to the dresser and look in the
mirror for the first time today. Written
across my forehead in black ink, it says:
Someone wrote on your forehead.
Ridge
Me: Morning. How’s the thesis coming
along?
Maggie: Do you want me to sugarcoat
it, or are you honestly giving me an
opening to vent?
Me: Wide open. Vent away.
Maggie: I’m miserable, Ridge. I hate it.
I work on it for hours every day, and I
just want to take a bat to my computer
and go all Office Space on it. If this
thesis were a child, I’d put it up for
adoption and not even think twice
about it. If this thesis were a cute,
fuzzy puppy, I’d drop it off in the
middle of a busy intersection and
speed away.
Me: And then you would do a U-turn
and go back and pick it up and play
with it all night.
Maggie: I’m serious, Ridge. I think I’m
losing my mind.
Me: Well, you already know what I
think.
Maggie: Yes, I know what you think.
Let’s not get into that right now.
Me: You’re the one who wanted to
vent. You don’t need this kind of
stress.
Maggie: Stop.
Me: I can’t, Maggie. You know how I
feel, and I’m not keeping my opinion to
myself when we both know I’m right.
Maggie: This is exactly why I never
whine to you about it, because it
always comes back to this same thing.
I asked you to stop. Please, Ridge.
Stop.
Me: Okay.
Me: I’m sorry.
Me: Now is when you return a text that
says, “It’s okay, Ridge. I love you.”
Me: Hello?
Me: Don’t do this, Maggie.
Maggie: Give a girl a minute to pee!
Dang. I’m not mad. I just don’t want to
talk about it anymore. How are you?
Me: Phew. Good. We got a new
roommate.
Maggie: I thought she wasn’t moving in
until next month.
Me: No, it’s not Bridgette’s sister. It’s
Sydney. The one I was telling you
about a few days ago? After I decided
to break the news to her about her
boyfriend, it left her with nowhere to
go. Warren and I are letting her stay
here until she finds her own place.
You’ll like her.
Maggie: So I guess she believed you
about her boyfriend?
Me: Yeah. She was pretty pissed at
first that I didn’t tell her sooner, but
she’s had a few days to let it sink in,
so I think she gets it. So what time will
you be here Friday?
Maggie: Not sure. I would say it
depends on whether I get enough work
done on my thesis, but I’m not
mentioning my thesis to you ever
again. I guess I’ll get there when I get
there.
Me: Well, then, I guess I’ll see you
when I see you. Love you. Let me
know when you’re on your way.
Maggie: Love you, too. And I know
you’re just concerned. I don’t expect
you to agree with my decisions, but I
do want you to understand them.
Me: I do understand, babe. I do. I love
you.
Maggie: Love you, too.
I drop my head forcefully against the
headboard and rub my palms up and
down my face out of sheer frustration. Of
course, I understand her decision, but
I’ll never feel good about it. She’s so
frustratingly determined I seriously don’t
see how I’ll ever get through to her.
I stand up and put my phone into my
back pocket, then walk to my bedroom
door. When I swing it open, I’m met
with a smell that I’m positive is exactly
what heaven will smell like.
Bacon.
Warren looks up at me from the
dining-room table and grins, pointing to
his plate full of food. “She’s a keeper,”
he signs. “The eggs suck, though. I’m
only eating them because I don’t want to
complain, or she might never cook for us
again. Everything else is great.” He
signs everything he’s saying without
verbalizing it. Warren usually verbalizes
all of his signed communication, out of
respect for others around us. When he
doesn’t verbalize, I know he wants our
conversation to remain between the two
of us.
Like the silent one we’re having right
now while Sydney’s in the kitchen.
“And she even asked how we liked
our coffee,” he signs.
I glance into the kitchen. Sydney
smiles, so I smile back. I’m shocked to
see her in a good mood today. After we
got back from our trip to the store a few
days ago, she’s been spending most of
the time in her room. At one point
yesterday, Warren went in to ask her if
she wanted any dinner, and he said she
was on her bed crying, so he backed out
and left her alone. I’ve wanted to check
on her, but there isn’t really anything I
can do to make her feel better. All she
can do is give it time, so I’m glad she’s
at least out of bed today.
“And don’t look right now, Ridge. But
did you see what she’s wearing? Did
you see that dress?” He bites the
knuckles on his fist and winces, as if
simply looking at her is causing him
actual physical pain.
I shake my head and take a seat across
from him. “I’ll look later.”
He grins. “I’m so glad her boyfriend
cheated on her. Otherwise, I’d be eating
leftover toothpaste-filled Oreos for
breakfast.”
I laugh. “At least you wouldn’t have
to brush your teeth.”
“This was the best decision we’ve
ever made,” he says. “Maybe later we
can talk her into vacuuming in that dress
while we sit on the couch and watch.”
Warren laughs at his own comment,
but I don’t crack a smile. I don’t think he
realizes he signed and spoke that last
sentence. Before I can tell him, a biscuit
comes hurtling past my head and smacks
him in the face. He jumps back in shock
and looks at Sydney. She’s walking to
the table with a Don’t mess with me
look on her face. She hands me a plate of
food, then sets her own plate down in
front of her and takes a seat.
“I said that out loud, didn’t I?”
Warren asks. I nod. He looks at Sydney,
and she’s still glaring at him. “At least I
was complimenting you,” he says with a
shrug.
She laughs and nods once, as if he just
made a good point. She picks up her
phone and begins to text. She glances at
me briefly, giving her head a slight shake
when my phone vibrates in my pocket.
She texted me something but apparently
doesn’t want me to make it obvious. I
casually slide my hand into my pocket
and pull my phone out, then read her text
under the table.
Sydney: Don’t eat the eggs.
I look at her and arch an eyebrow,
wondering what the hell is wrong with
the eggs. She casually sends another text
while she holds a conversation with
Warren.
Sydney: I poured dish soap and baby
powder in them. It’ll teach him not to
write on my forehead again.
Me: WTH? When are you going to tell
him?
Sydney: I’m not.
Warren: What are you and Sydney
texting about?
I look up to see Warren holding his
phone, staring at me. He picks up his
fork and takes another bite of the eggs,
and the sight makes me laugh. He lunges
across the table and grabs my phone out
of my hands, then begins scrolling
through the texts. I try to grab it back
from him, but he pulls his arm out of my
reach. He pauses for a few seconds as
he reads, then immediately spits his
mouthful back onto his plate. He tosses
me back my phone and reaches for his
glass. He calmly takes a drink, sets it
back down on the table, then pushes his
chair back and stands up.
He points to Sydney. “You just
messed up, little girl,” he says. “This
means war.”
Sydney is smirking at him with a
challenging gleam in her eye. Once
Warren walks back to his bedroom and
shuts his door, she loses the confident
smirk and turns to me, wide-eyed.
Sydney: Help me! I need ideas. I suck
at pranks!
Me: Yeah, you do. Dish soap and
baby powder? You need serious help.
Good thing you have the master on
your side.
She grins, then begins eating her
breakfast.
I don’t even get my first bite down
before Bridgette walks out of her room,
sans smile. She walks straight to the
kitchen and proceeds to make herself a
plate of food. Warren returns from his
room and sits back down at the table.
“I walked away for dramatic effect,”
he says. “I wasn’t finished eating yet.”
Bridgette sits, takes a bite of bacon,
then looks over at Sydney. “DID . . .
YOU . . . MAKE . . . THIS?” she says,
pointing at the food dramatically. I cock
my head, because she’s talking to
Sydney the same way she talks to me. As
if she’s deaf.
I look over at Sydney, who nods a
response to Bridgette. I look back at
Bridgette, and she says, “THANK . . .
YOU!” She takes a bite of the eggs.
And she spits them right back out onto
her plate.
She coughs and rushes to take a drink,
then pushes away from the table. She
looks back at Sydney. “I . . . CAN’T . . .
EAT . . . THIS . . . SHIT!” She walks
back to the kitchen, drops her food in the
trash, and heads back to her bedroom.
The three of us break out into laughter
after her door closes. When the laughter
subsides, I turn to Warren.
“Why does Bridgette think Sydney is
deaf?”
Warren laughs. “We don’t know,” he
says. “But we don’t feel like correcting
her just yet.”
I laugh on the outside, but inside I’m a
little confused. I don’t know when
Warren began referring to himself and
Sydney as we, but I’m not sure I like it.
• • •
My bedroom light flicks on and off, so I
close my laptop and walk to the door. I
open it, and Sydney is standing in the
hallway, holding her laptop. She hands
me a piece of paper.
I already finished my homework for
the rest of the week. I even cleaned the
entire apartment, excluding Bridgette’s
room, of course. Warren won’t let me
watch TV because it’s not my night,
whatever that means. So I was hoping I
could hang out with you for a little
while? I have to keep my mind busy, or
I’ll start thinking about Hunter again,
and then I’ll start feeling sorry for
myself, and then I’ll want Pine-Sol, and
I really don’t want to have any Pine-
Sol, because I don’t want to become a
raging alcoholic like you.
I smile, step aside, and motion her
into my bedroom. She looks around. The
only place to sit is my bed, so I point to
it, then take a seat and pull my laptop
onto my lap. She sits on the other side of
the bed and does the same.
“Thanks,” she says with a smile. She
opens her laptop and drops her eyes to
the screen.
I tried not to take Warren’s advice
this morning about admiring the dress
she had on today, but it was hard not to
look, especially when he so blatantly
pointed it out. I’m not sure what kind of
weird thing he and Bridgette have going
on, but it rubs me the wrong way that he
and Sydney seem to have hit it off so
well.
And it really rubs me the wrong way
that it rubs me the wrong way. I don’t
look at her like that, so I don’t
understand why I’m sitting here thinking
about it. And if she were standing next to
Maggie, there wouldn’t be a doubt in my
mind that Maggie is more physically my
type. Maggie is petite, with dark eyes
and straight black hair. Sydney is the
complete opposite. She’s taller than
Maggie—pretty average height—but her
body is a lot more defined and curvy
than Maggie’s. Sydney definitely fills
out the dress well, which is why Warren
liked it. At least she changed into shorts
before showing up at my bedroom door.
That helps a little. The tops she wears
are usually way too big for her, and they
hang off her shoulders, which makes me
think she took a lot of Hunter’s T-shirts
with her when she packed her bags.
Maggie’s hair is always straight,
whereas Sydney’s is hard to figure out. It
seems to change with the weather, but
that’s not necessarily a bad thing. The
first time I saw her sitting on her
balcony, I thought she had brown hair,
but it turns out her hair was just wet.
After playing guitar for about an hour
that night, I looked at her as she was
walking back inside her apartment, and
her hair had dried completely and was in
piles of blond waves that fell past her
shoulders. Today it’s curly and pulled
up into a messy knot on top of her head.
Sydney: Stop staring at me.
Shit.
I laugh and attempt to brush away
whatever the hell that internal detour
was I just took.
Me: You look sad.
The first night she showed up here,
she seemed happier than she does right
now. Maybe it just took time for reality
to sink in.
Sydney: Is there a way we can chat
on the computer? It’s a lot easier for
me than texting.
Me: Sure. What’s your last name? I’ll
friend you on Facebook.
Sydney: Blake.
I open my laptop and search her name.
When I find her profile, I send her a
friend request. She accepts it almost
instantly, then shoots me a message.
Sydney: Hello, Ridge Lawson.
Me: Hello, Sydney Blake. Better?
She nods.
Sydney: You’re a computer
programmer?
Me: Already stalking my profile? And
yes. I work from home. Graduated two
years ago with a degree in computer
engineering.
Sydney: How old are you?
Me: 24.
Sydney: Please tell me 24 is a lot
better than 22.
Me: 22 will be good for you. Maybe not
this week or next week, but it’ll get
better.
She sighs and puts one of her hands up
to the back of her neck and rubs it, then
begins typing again.
Sydney: I miss him. Is that crazy? I
miss Tori, too. I still hate them and
want to see them suffer, but I miss
what I had with him. It’s really starting
to hurt. When it first happened, I
thought maybe I was better off without
him, but now I just feel lost.
I don’t want to be harsh in my
response, but at the same time, I’m not a
girl, so I’m not about to tell her that what
she’s feeling is normal. Because to me,
it’s not normal.
Me: You only miss the idea of him.
You weren’t happy with him even
before you found out he was cheating.
You were only with him because it was
comfortable. You just miss the
relationship, but you don’t miss Hunter.
She looks up at me and cocks her
head, narrowing her eyes in my direction
for a few seconds before dropping them
back to the computer.
Sydney: How can you say I wasn’t
happy with him? I was. Until I found
out what he was doing, I honestly
thought he was the one.
Me: No. You didn’t. You wanted him to
be, but that’s not how you really felt.
Sydney: You’re kind of being a jerk
right now, you know that?
I set my laptop beside me and walk to
my desk. I pick up my notebook and a
pen and go back to the bed and take a
seat next to her. I flip open my notebook
to the first set of lyrics she sent me.
Read these, I write at the top of the
page. I set the notebook in her lap.
She looks down at the lyrics, then
takes the pen. I don’t need to read them,
she writes. I wrote them.
I scoot closer to her and put the
notebook in my lap, then circle a few
lines of her chorus. I point to them again.
Read these as if you weren’t the one
who wrote them.
She reluctantly looks down at the
notebook and reads the chorus.
You don’t know me like you think
you do
I pour me one, when I really want
two
Oh, you’re living a lie
Living a lie
You think we’re good, but we’re
really not
You coulda fixed things, but you
missed your shot
You’re living a lie
Living a lie
When I’m certain she’s had time to read
them, I pick up the pen and write: These
words came from somewhere inside
you, Sydney. You can tell yourself you
were better off with him, but read the
lyrics you wrote. Go back to what you
were feeling when you wrote them. I
circle several lines, then read her words
along with her.
With a right turn, the tires start to
burn
I see your smile, it’s been hiding
for a while
For a while
Your foot pushes down against the
ground
The world starts to blur, can’t
remember who you were
Who you were
I look at her, and she’s still staring at the
paper. A single tear trickles down her
cheek, and she quickly wipes it away.
She picks up the pen and begins
writing. They’re just words, Ridge.
I reply, They’re your words, Sydney.
Words that came from you. You say you
feel lost without him, but you felt lost
even when you were with him. Read the
rest.
She inhales a deep breath, then looks
down at the paper again.
I yell, slow down, we’re almost out
of town
The road gets rough, have you had
enough
Enough
You look at me, start heading for a
tree
I open up the door, can’t take any
more
Any more
Then I say,
You don’t know me like you think
you do
I pour me one, when I really want
two
Oh, you’re living a lie
Living a lie
You think we’re good, but we’re
really not
You coulda fixed things, but you
missed your shot
You’re living a lie
Living a lie
Chapter Six
Sydney
I continue to stare at the words in the
notebook.
Is he right? Did I write them because
that’s how I really feel?
I never give it much thought when I
write lyrics, because I’ve always felt no
one would read them, so it doesn’t
matter what the meaning is behind the
words. But now that I think about it,
maybe the fact that I don’t give them
much thought proves that they really are
a reflection of how I feel. To me, lyrics
are harder to write when you have to
invent the feelings behind them. That’s
when lyrics take a lot of thought, when
they aren’t genuine.
Oh, wow. Ridge is absolutely right. I
wrote these lyrics weeks ago, long
before I knew about Hunter and Tori.
I lean back against the headboard and
open my laptop again.
Me: Okay, you win.
Ridge: It’s not a competition. Just
trying to help you see that maybe this
breakup is exactly what you needed. I
don’t know you very well, but based on
the lyrics you wrote, I’m guessing
you’ve been craving the chance to be
on your own for a while now.
Me: Well you claim not to know me
very well, but you seem to know me
better than I know myself.
Ridge: I only know what you told me in
those lyrics. Speaking of which, you
feel like running through them? I was
about to compile them with the music
to send to Brennan and could use your
ears. Pun intended.
I laugh and elbow him.
Me: Sure. What do I do?
He stands and picks up his guitar, then
nods his head toward the balcony. I
don’t want to go out on that balcony. I
don’t care if I was ready to leave
Hunter, I sure wasn’t ready to leave
Tori. And being out there will be too
much of a distraction.
I crinkle my nose and shake my head.
He glances across the courtyard at my
apartment, then pulls his lips into a tight,
thin line and slowly nods his head in
understanding. He walks over to the bed
and sits on the mattress next to me.
Ridge: I want you to sing the lyrics
while I play. I’ll watch you so I can
make sure we’re on the same page
with where they need to be placed on
the sheet music.
Me: No. I’m not singing in front of you.
He huffs and rolls his eyes.
Ridge: Are you afraid I’ll laugh at how
awful you sound? I can’t HEAR YOU,
SYDNEY!
He’s smiling his irritating smile at me.
Me: Shut up. Fine.
He sets the phone down and begins
playing the song. When the lyrics are
supposed to come in, he looks up, and I
freeze. Not because I’m nervous, though.
I freeze because I’m doing that thing
again where I’m holding my breath
because seeing him play is just . . . he’s
incredible.
He doesn’t miss a beat when I skip my
intro. He just starts over from the
beginning and plays the opening again. I
shake myself out of my pathetic awe and
begin singing the words. I would
probably never be singing lyrics in front
of anyone one-on-one like this, but it
helps that he can’t hear me. He does
stare pretty hard, though, which is a little
unnerving.
He pauses after every stanza and
makes notes on a page. I lean over and
look at what he’s writing. He’s putting
musical notes on blank sheet-music
paper, along with the lyrics.
He points to one of the lines, then
grabs his phone.
Ridge: What key do you sing this line
in?
Me: B.
Ridge: Do you think it would sound
better if you took it a little higher?
Me: I don’t know. I guess we could try.
He plays the second part of the song
again, and I take his advice and sing in a
higher key. Surprisingly, he’s right. It
does sound better.
“How did you know that?” I ask.
He shrugs.
Ridge: I just do.
Me: But how? If you can’t hear, how
do you know what sounds good and
what doesn’t?
Ridge: I don’t need to hear it. I feel it.
I shake my head, not understanding. I
can maybe understand how he’s taught
himself to play a guitar. With enough
practice and a good teacher and maybe a
ton of studying, it’s possible for him to
play as he does. But that doesn’t explain
how he can know which key a voice
should be in and especially which key
sounds better.
Ridge: What’s wrong? You look
confused.
Me: I AM confused. I don’t understand
how you can differentiate between
vibrations or however you say you feel
it. I’m beginning to think you and
Warren are trying to pull off the
ultimate prank and you’re only
pretending to be deaf.
Ridge laughs, then scoots back on the
bed until his back meets the headboard.
He sits up straight and holds his guitar to
his side. He spreads his legs, then pats
the empty spot between them.
What the hell? I hope my eyes aren’t
open as wide as I think they are. There’s
no way I’m sitting that close to him. I
shake my head.
He rolls his eyes and picks up his
phone.
Ridge: Come here. I want to show you
how I feel it. Get over yourself, and
stop thinking I’m trying to seduce you.
I hesitate a few more seconds, but the
agitation on his face makes me think I’m
being a little immature. I crawl forward,
then turn around and carefully sit in front
of him with my back to his chest but with
several inches between us. He pulls the
guitar in front of me and wraps his other
arm around me until he’s holding it in
position. He pulls it closer, which
pushes me flush against him. Ridge
reaches down to his side and picks up
his phone.
Ridge: I’m going to play a chord, and I
want you to tell me where you feel it.
I nod, and he brings his hand back to
the guitar. He plays a chord and repeats
it a few times, then pauses. I grab my
phone.
Me: I felt it in your guitar.
He shakes his head and picks up his
phone again.
Ridge: I know you felt it in the guitar,
dummy. But where in your body did
you feel it?
Me: Play it again.
I close my eyes this time and try to
take this seriously. I’ve asked him how
he feels it, and he’s trying to show me,
so the least I can do is try to understand.
He plays the chord a few times, and I’m
really trying hard to concentrate, but I
feel the vibration everywhere,
especially in the guitar pressed against
my chest.
Me: It’s hard for me, Ridge. It just feels
like it’s everywhere.
He pushes me forward, and I scoot up.
He sets the guitar down, stands up, and
walks out of the bedroom. I wait for him,
curious about what he’s doing. When he
comes back, he’s holding something in
his fist. He holds his fist out, so I hold
up my palm.
Earplugs.
He slides in behind me, and I scoot
back against his chest again, then put the
earplugs in. I close my eyes and lean my
head back against his shoulder. He
wraps his arms around me and picks up
his guitar, pulling it against my chest. I
can feel his head rest lightly against
mine, and the intimate way we’re seated
suddenly registers. I’ve never sat like
this with someone I wasn’t seriously
dating.
It’s odd, because it seems so natural
with him. Not at all as if he’s got
anything other than music on his mind. I
like that about him, because if I were
pressed up against Warren like this, I’m
positive his hands wouldn’t be on the
guitar.
I can feel his arms moving slightly, so
I know he’s playing, even though I can’t
hear it. I concentrate on the vibration and
focus all my attention on the movement
inside my chest. When I’m able to
pinpoint exactly where I feel it, I bring
my hand to my chest and pat it. I can feel
him nod his head, and then he continues
playing.
I can still feel it in my chest, but it’s
much lower this time. I move my hand
down, and he nods again.
I pull away from him and turn around
to face him.
“Wow.”
He lifts his shoulders and smiles
shyly. It’s adorable.
Me: This is crazy. I still don’t
understand how you can play an
instrument like this, but I know how
you feel it now.
He shrugs off my compliment, and I
love how modest he is, because he
clearly has more talent than anyone I’ve
ever met.
“Wow,” I say again, shaking my head.
Ridge: Stop. I don’t like compliments.
It’s awkward.
I set down my phone and we both
move back to the laptops.
Me: Well, you shouldn’t be so
impressive, then. I don’t think you
realize what an incredible gift you
have, Ridge. I know you say you work
hard at it, but so do thousands of
people who can hear, and they can’t
put together songs like you can. I
mean, I can maybe understand the
whole guitar thing now that you’ve
explained it, but what about the voices?
How in the heck can you know what a
voice sounds like and what key it
needs to be in?
Ridge: Actually, I can’t differentiate the
sounds of a voice. I’ve never felt a
person sing the way I “listen” to a
guitar. I can place vocals to a song
and develop melodies because I’ve
studied a lot of songs and have
learned which keys match up to which
notes, based on the written form of
music. It doesn’t just come naturally. I
work hard at this. I love the idea of
music, and even though I can’t hear it,
I’ve learned to understand and
appreciate it in a different way. I’ve
had to work harder at the melodies.
There are times I’ll write a song, and
Brennan will tell me we can’t use it
because it either sounds too much like
an existing song or it doesn’t actually
sound good to hearing ears like I
assumed it would.
He can downplay this all he wants,
but I’m convinced I’m sitting next to a
musical genius. I hate that he thinks his
ability comes from working so hard at it.
I mean, I’m sure it helps, because all
talents have to be nurtured in order to
excel, even for the gifted. But his talent
is mind-blowing. It makes me hurt for
him, knowing what he could do with his
gift if he could hear.
Me: Can you hear anything? At all?
He shakes his head.
Ridge: I’ve worn hearing aids before,
but they were more inconvenient than
helpful. I have profound hearing loss,
so they didn’t help at all when it came
to hearing voices or my guitar. When I
used them, I could tell there were
noises, but I couldn’t decipher them. In
all honesty, hearing aids were a
constant reminder that I couldn’t hear.
Without them, I don’t even think about
it.
Me: What made you want to learn
guitar, knowing you would never be
able to hear it?
Ridge: Brennan. He wanted to learn
when we were kids, so we learned
together.
Me: The guy who used to live here?
How long have you known him?
Ridge: 21 years. He’s my little brother.
Me: Is he in your band?
Ridge glances at me in confusion.
Ridge: Have I not told you about our
band?
I shake my head.
Ridge: He’s the singer. He also plays
guitar.
Me: When do you play next? I want to
watch.
He laughs.
Ridge: I don’t play. It’s kind of
complicated. Brennan insists that I
have as much stake in the ownership
of the band as he does because I write
the majority of the music, which is why
I refer to myself as being part of the
band sometimes. I think it’s ridiculous,
but he’s convinced we wouldn’t be
where we are at this point without me,
so I agree to it for now. But with the
success I think he’s about to have, I’ll
make him renegotiate eventually. I
don’t like feeling as though I’m taking
advantage of him.
Me: If he doesn’t feel that way, then
you definitely shouldn’t feel that way.
And why don’t you play with them?
Ridge: I have a few times. It’s kind of
difficult, not being able to hear
everything else going on with the band
during a song, so I feel like I throw
them off when I play with them.
Besides, they’re on tour right now, and
I can’t travel, so I’ve just been sending
him the stuff I write.
Me: Why can’t you tour with them?
Don’t you work from home?
Ridge: Other obligations. But next time
they’re in Austin, I’ll take you.
I’ll take you. I think I like that part of
his message a little too much.
Me: What’s the name of the band?
Ridge: Sounds of Cedar.
I slam my laptop shut and swing my
eyes to his. “Shut up!” He nods,
then reaches down and opens my
laptop again.
Ridge: You’ve heard of us?
Me: Yes. Everyone on campus has
heard of your band, considering they
played almost every single weekend
last year. Hunter loves you guys.
Ridge: Ah. Well, this is the first time
I’ve ever wished we had one less fan.
So you’ve seen Brennan play?
Me: I only went with Hunter once, and
it was one of the last shows, but yes. I
think I may have most of the songs on
my phone, actually.
Ridge: Wow. Small world. We are
close to a record deal. That’s why I’ve
been stressing so much about these
songs. And why you need to help me.
Me: OMG! I just realized I’m writing
lyrics for SOUNDS OF CEDAR!!!
I slide my laptop over, then roll onto
my stomach and squeal into the mattress
while I kick my legs up and down.
Holy crap! This is too cool.
I compose myself, ignoring Ridge’s
laughter, then sit up straight again and
grab my laptop.
Me: So you wrote most of those
songs?
He nods.
Me: Did you write the lyrics to the
song “Something”?
He nods again. I seriously can’t
believe this is happening right now.
Knowing he wrote those lyrics and now
I’m sitting here next to him is exciting
me way too much.
Me: I’m about to listen to your song.
Since you get to decipher my lyrics,
it’s my turn to decipher yours.
Ridge: I wrote that song two years
ago.
Me: Still. It came from you. From
somewhere inside you, Ridge. ;)
He picks up a pillow and throws it at
my head. I laugh and scroll through the
music folder on my phone until I find the
song, and I hit play.
SOMETHING
I keep on wondering why
I can’t say ’bye to you
And the only thing I can
think of is the truth
It’s hard to start over
Keep checkin’ that rearview, too
But something’s coming
Something right for you
Just wait a bit longer
You’ll find something you wanted
Something you needed
Something you want to have
repeated
Oh, that feeling’s all right
You’ll find that if you listen
Between all the kissing
What made it work
Wound up missing
Oh, that seems about right
I guess I thought that we would
Always stay the same
And I can tell that you find
Somebody to blame
And I know in my heart,
In my mind, it’s all a game
Our hopes and wishes
Won’t relight the flame
Just wait a bit longer
You’ll find something you wanted
Something you needed
Something you want to have
repeated
Oh, that feeling’s all right
You’ll find that if you listen
Between all the kissing
What made it work
Wound up missing
Oh, that seems about right
You don’t ever have to wonder
’Cause you will always know
That what we had was for sure
For sure
Now that thing is no more
No more
You’ll find what you wanted
You’ll find what you needed
You’ll find what you wanted
You’ll find what you needed
You’ll find what you needed
When the song ends, I sit back up on the
bed. I would ask him about the lyrics
and the meaning behind them right now,
but I’m not sure I want to. I want to
listen to it again without him watching
me, because it’s really hard to
concentrate when he’s staring at me.
He’s resting his chin in his hands,
casually watching me. I try to hide my
grin, but it’s hard. I see a smile spread
across his lips before he looks down at
his phone.
Ridge: Why do I feel like you’re
fangirling right now?
Probably because I am.
Me: I’m not fangirling. Don’t flatter
yourself. I’ve witnessed how evil you
can be with your revenge schemes,
and I’ve been exposed to your severe
alcoholism, so I’m not as enamored
with you as I could be.
Ridge: My father was a severe
alcoholic. Your jokes are a little offputting.
I look up at him apologetically and
with a hint of embarrassment. “I’m
sorry. I was kidding.”
Ridge: I’m kidding, too.
I kick him in the knee and glare at him.
Ridge: Well, sort of kidding. My father
really is a raging alcoholic, but I don’t
give a shit if you joke about it.
Me: I can’t now. You ruined the fun.
He laughs, and it’s followed by an
awkward moment of silence. I grin and
drop my eyes back to my phone.
Me: OMG. Can I have your autograph?
He rolls his eyes.
Me: Please? And can I have my
picture taken with you? OMG, I’m in
Ridge Lawson’s bed!
I’m laughing, but Ridge isn’t finding
me amusing.
Me: Ridge Lawson, will you sign my
boobs?
He puts his laptop down beside him,
leans over to his nightstand and picks up
a marker, then turns back to me.
I don’t really want his autograph.
Surely he knows I’m kidding.
He pulls the lid off the marker, swiftly
lunges across the bed, and knocks me
onto my back, bringing the marker to my
forehead.
He’s trying to sign my face?
I lift my legs and create a barrier with
my knees as I try to force his hands
away.
Dammit, he’s strong.
He puts one of my hands under his
knee and locks my arm to the bed. His
other arm grabs my arm that’s pushing
his face away, and he pushes that hand to
the bed, too. I’m screaming and laughing
and trying to turn my face away from
him, but every time I move, the marker
moves over my face while he tries to
sign his name.
I’m unable to overpower him, so I
eventually sigh and hold my head still so
he’ll stop drawing all over my face.
He hops up, puts the lid back on the
marker, and smirks at me.
I reach over to my laptop.
Me: You are no longer my prank
master. This has officially turned into a
three-way war. Excuse me while I go
Google my revenge.
I fold up my laptop and walk quietly
out of the room while he laughs at me.
As I head through the living room
toward my bedroom, Warren glances at
me. Twice.
“Should have stayed in here and
watched porn with me,” he says, taking
in the marker all over my face.
I ignore his comment. “Ridge and I
just finished discussing TV rules,” I lie.
“I get Thursdays.”
“No, you don’t,” Warren says.
“Tomorrow is Thursday. I watch
Thursday-night porn on Thursday.”
“Not anymore you don’t. Guess you
should have asked about my television
habits when you were interviewing me.”
He groans. “Fine. You can have
Thursdays, but only if you wear that
dress you had on earlier.”
I laugh. “I’m burning that dress.”
Ridge
“Why’d you give Sydney the TV
tonight?” Warren signs. He drops onto
the couch next to me. “You know I love
Thursday night. I’m off work on
Fridays.”
“I never talked to Sydney about TV
nights.”
He glances toward Sydney’s bedroom
door with a scowl on his face. “What a
little liar. How did you meet her,
anyway?”
“Music-related. She’s writing lyrics
for the band.”
Warren’s eyes bulge, and he
straightens up on the couch, turning to
look at me as if I’ve just betrayed him.
“Don’t you think this is something
your manager should know about?”
I laugh and sign back to him. “Good
point. Hey, Warren, Sydney is officially
writing lyrics for us.”
He frowns. “And don’t you think your
manager should have discussed a
financial arrangement with her? What
percentage are we giving her?”
“We’re not. She feels guilty taking a
percentage while she’s not paying rent,
so we’re good for now.”
He’s standing now, glaring down at
me. “How do you know you can trust
her? And what if something happens
with a song she helped write? What if it
makes the cut on the album and she
suddenly decides she wants a
percentage? And why the hell aren’t you
writing the lyrics anymore?”
I sigh. We’ve been over this so many
times it’s making my head hurt. “I can’t.
You know I can’t. It’s just for a little
while, until I get over my block. And
calm down, she’s agreed to sign over
anything she helps with.”
He drops back onto the couch,
frustrated. “Just don’t add any more
people to our band without consulting
me first, okay? I feel like I’m being shut
out when you don’t include me.” He
folds his arms across his chest and
pouts.
“Is sweet little Warren pouting?” I
lean forward and wrap my arms around
him, and he tries to shove me off. I climb
on top of him and kiss his cheek, and he
starts hitting me in the arm, trying to pull
away from my grasp. I laugh and let go
of his face, then look up at Sydney, who
just walked into the room. She’s staring
at us. Warren slides his hand up my thigh
and lays his head on my shoulder. I
reach up and pat his cheek while we
both stare up at her, straight-faced. She
shakes her head slowly and walks back
into her bedroom.
As soon as her bedroom door closes,
we separate.
“I wish I hated Bridgette a little more
than I do at night, because Sydney
definitely needs me,” Warren signs.
I laugh, knowing Sydney is more than
likely swearing off guys based on the
week she’s had. “That girl doesn’t need
anything other than the opportunity to be
alone for a while.”
Warren shakes his head. “No, that girl
definitely needs me. I wonder how I can
pull off an elaborate prank that involves
her agreeing to have sex with me.”
“Bridgette,” I remind him. I don’t
know why I remind him. I never remind
him about Bridgette when he talks about
other girls.
“You’re a dream crusher,” he signs,
falling back against the couch at the
same moment I receive a text.
Sydney: Can I ask you a question?
Me: As long as you promise never
again to start a question off with
whether or not you can propose a
question.
Sydney: Okay, asshole. I know I
shouldn’t be thinking about him at all,
but I’m curious. What did he write on
that paper when we went to get my
purse? And what did you write back
that made him hit you?
Me: I agree that you shouldn’t be
thinking about him at all, but I’m
honestly shocked it’s taken you this
long to ask me about it.
Sydney: Well?
Ugh. I hate writing it verbatim, but she
wants to know, so . . .
Me: He wrote, “Are you fucking her?”
Sydney: OMG! What a prick!
Me: Yep.
Sydney: So what did you say back to
him that made him punch you?
Me: I wrote, “Why do you think I’m
here for her purse? I gave her a
hundred for tonight, and now she owes
me change.”
I reread the text, and I’m not so sure it
sounds as funny as I thought it did.
My eyes dart up to her bedroom door,
which is now swinging open. She runs
into the living room, directly toward the
couch. I don’t know if it’s the look on
her face or the hands that are coming at
me, but I immediately cover my head and
duck behind Warren. He doesn’t really
like being used as a human shield,
though, so he jumps off the couch. She
continues slapping at my arms until I’m
curled up in a fetal position on the
couch. I’m trying not to laugh, but she
hits like a girl. This is nothing compared
to what I saw her do to Tori.
She backs away, and I reluctantly
uncover my head. She marches back to
her room, and I watch as she slams her
door.
Warren is now standing next to the
couch with his hands on his hips. He
looks at me, then looks back at Sydney’s
door. He puts his palms up and shakes
his head, then retreats into his bedroom.
I should probably apologize to her. It
was just a joke, but I guess I can see
how it would piss her off. I knock on her
door a couple of times. She doesn’t open
it, so I text her.
Me: Can I come in?
Sydney: That depends. Do you have
any bills smaller than a hundred this
time?
Me: It seemed funny at the time. I’m
sorry.
A few seconds pass, and then her
door opens and she steps aside. I raise
my eyebrows and smile, attempting to
look innocent. She shoots me a dirty
look and walks back to her bed.
Sydney: It wasn’t what I would have
wanted you to say, but I can see why
you said it. He’s a jerk, and I probably
would have wanted to piss him off in
that moment, too.
Me: He is a jerk, but I probably should
have responded differently. I’m sorry.
Sydney: Yes, you should have. Maybe
instead of insinuating that I was a
whore, you could have gone with “If I
could only be so lucky.”
I laugh at her comment, then offer up
another alternative answer.
Me: I could have gone with “Only when
you’re being faithful to her. Which is
never.”
Sydney: Or you could have said, “No,
I’m not. I’m madly in love with
Warren.”
At least she’s making jokes about it. I
really do feel sort of bad for saying that
to him, but it felt oddly appropriate at
the time.
Me: We didn’t really get any work
done last night. Are you in the mood to
make beautiful music together?
Chapter Seven
Sydney
Ridge puts down his guitar for the first
time in more than an hour. We haven’t
texted at all, because we’ve been on a
roll. It’s pretty cool how well we seem
to work together. He plays a song over
and over while I lie across his bed with
a notebook in front of me. I write down
the lyrics as they come to me, most of the
time crumpling up the paper, chucking it
across the room, and starting over. But
I’ve finished lyrics for almost an entire
song tonight, and he’s only crossed out
two lines he didn’t like. I’d say that’s
progress.
There’s something about these
moments when we’re writing music that
I absolutely love. All my worries and
thoughts about everything wrong in my
life seem to go away for the short times
we write together. It’s nice.
Ridge: Let’s do the whole song now.
Sit up so I can watch you sing it. I
want to make sure we have it perfect
before I send it to Brennan.
He starts playing the song, so I begin
singing. He’s watching me closely, and
the way his eyes seem to read my every
movement makes me uneasy. Maybe it’s
because he can’t express words through
speaking, but everything else about him
seems to make up for that.
As easy as he is to read, it’s only that
way when he wants to be read. Most of
the time, he’s able to hold back his
expressions, and I don’t know what the
hell he’s thinking. He holds the crown in
the nonverbal department. I’m pretty
sure that with the looks he gives, if he
could speak, he’d never even have to.
I feel uncomfortable watching him
watch me sing, so I close my eyes and
try to recall the lyrics as he continues to
play the song. It’s awkward singing them
with him only a few feet away. When I
wrote the lyrics the first time, he was
playing his guitar but was a good two
hundred yards away on his balcony.
Still, though, as much as I tried to
pretend I was writing them about Hunter
at the time, I knew I was imagining
Ridge singing them all along.
A LITTLE BIT MORE
Why don’t you let me
Take you away
We can live like you wanted
From place to place
I’ll be your home
We can make our own
’Cause together makes it pretty
hard to be alone
We can have everything we ever
wanted
And just a little bit more
Just a little bit more
His guitar stops, so naturally, I stop. I
open my eyes, and he’s watching me
with one of his expressionless
expressions.
I take that back. This expression isn’t
expressionless at all. He’s thinking. I
can tell by the squint in his eyes that he’s
coming up with an idea.
He glances away in order to pick up
his phone.
Ridge: Do you mind if I try something?
Me: As long as you promise never
again to propose a question by asking
if I mind if you can try something.
Ridge: Nice try, but that made no
sense.
I laugh, then look up at him. I nod
softly, scared of what he’s about to
“try.” He sits up on his knees and leans
forward, placing both hands on my
shoulders. I attempt to hold in my gasp,
but it’s a failed attempt. I don’t know
what he’s doing or why he’s getting so
close to me, but holy crap.
Holy crap.
Why is my heart spazzing out right
now?
He pushes me until I’m flat on his
mattress. He reaches behind him and
picks up his guitar, then lays it on the
other side of me. He lies down next to
me. Calm down, heart. Please. Ridge has
supersonic senses, and he’ll feel you
beating through the vibrations of the
mattress.
Ridge scoots closer to me and by the
way he’s hesitating, it makes me think
he’s unsure if I’ll allow him any closer.
I will. I absolutely will.
He’s staring at me now, contemplating
his next move. I can tell he’s not about to
make a pass at me. Whatever he’s about
to do is making him way more
apprehensive than if he were just
planning to kiss me. He’s eyeing my
neck and chest as if he’s searching for a
particular part of me. His eyes stop on
my abdomen, pause, then fall back to his
phone.
Oh, Lord. What is he about to do? Put
his hands on me? Does he want to feel
me sing this song? Feeling requires
touching, and touching requires hands.
His hands. Feeling me.
Ridge: Do you trust me?
Me: I don’t trust anyone anymore. My
trust has been completely depleted this
week.
Ridge: Can you replenish your trust
for about five minutes? I want to feel
your voice.
I inhale, then look at him—lying next
to me—and I nod. He sets down his
phone without breaking my gaze. He’s
watching me as if he’s warning me to
stay calm, but it’s having the exact
opposite effect. I’m sort of panicked
right now.
He scoots closer and slides his arm
under the back of my neck.
Oh.
Now he’s even closer.
Now his face is hovering over mine.
He reaches across my body and pulls the
guitar flush against my side, bringing it
closer to us. He’s still eyeing me with a
look that seems intended to produce a
calming effect.
It doesn’t. It doesn’t calm me down at
all. He lowers his head to my chest, then
presses his cheek against my shirt.
Oh, this is great. Now he definitely
feels how spastic my heart is beating
right now. I close my eyes and want to
die of embarrassment, but I don’t have
time for that, because he begins
strumming the strings of the guitar next to
me. I realize he’s playing with both
hands, one from underneath my head and
one over me. His head is against my
chest, and I can feel his hair brush my
neck. He’s pretty much sprawled across
me in order to reach his guitar with both
arms.
Oh, my dear sweet baby Jesus in a
wicker basket.
How does he expect me to sing?
I try to calm down by regulating my
breathing, but it’s hard when we’re
positioned like this. As usual when I
miss an intro, he seamlessly starts the
song over again from the beginning.
When he reaches the point where I come
in, I begin singing. Sort of. It’s really
quiet, because I’m still waiting for air to
find its way back into my lungs.
After the first few lines, I find a
steadiness to my voice. I close my eyes
and do my best to imagine I’m simply
sitting up on his bed right now the way I
have been for the last hour.
I’ll bring my suitcase
You bring that old map
We can live by the book
Or we can never go back
Feeling the breeze
Never felt so right
We’ll watch the stars
Until they fade into light
We can have everything we ever
wanted
And just a little bit more
Just a little bit more
He finishes the last chord but doesn’t
move. His hands remain stilled on his
guitar. His ear remains firmly pressed
against my chest. My breaths are heavier
now that I’ve just sung an entire song,
and his head rises with each intake of
air. He sighs a deep sigh, then lifts his
head and rolls onto his back without
making eye contact with me. We lie in
silence for a few minutes. I’m not sure
why he’s being so unresponsive, but I’m
too nervous to make any sudden
movements. His arm is still underneath
me, and he’s making no effort to remove
it, so I’m not even sure if he’s finished
with this little experiment yet.
I’m also not sure I’d even be able to
move.
Sydney, Sydney, Sydney. What are
you doing?
I absolutely, positively, do not want
to be having this reaction right now. It’s
been a week since I broke up with
Hunter. The very last thing I want—or
even need—is to develop a crush on this
guy. However, I’m thinking that may have
happened before this week.
Crap.
I tilt my head and look at him. He’s
watching me, but I can’t tell what his
face is trying to convey. If I had to guess,
I’d say he’s thinking, Oh, hey, Sydney.
Our mouths sure are close together.
Let’s do them a favor and close this
gap.
His eyes drop to my mouth, and I’m
incredibly impressed with my telepathic
abilities. His full lips are slightly parted
as he quietly takes in several slow, deep
breaths.
I can actually hear him breathing,
which surprises me, because that’s
another of his sounds that he keeps
complete and total control over. I like
that he can’t seem to control it right now.
As much as I claim to want to be
unattached from guys and independent
and strong, the only thing I’m thinking is
how much I wish he would take
complete and total control over me. I
want him to dominate this situation by
rolling on top of me and forcing that
incredible mouth onto mine, rendering
me completely dependent on him for
breath.
My phone receives a text, interrupting
my clearly overactive imagination.
Ridge closes his eyes and turns to face
the opposite direction. I sigh, knowing
he didn’t even hear the text, so turning
away was of his own accord. Which
means I’m feeling pretty awkward right
now for just having that rich internal
dialogue sweep through my mind. I reach
behind my head and feel around until I
find my phone.
Hunter: Are you ready to talk yet?
I roll my eyes. Way to ruin the
moment, Hunter. I was hoping that after
days of avoiding his texts and phone
calls, he would finally get a clue. I shake
my head and text him back.
Me: Your behavior is bordering on
harassment. Stop contacting me.
We’re done.
Ridge
Stop with the guilt trip, Ridge. You
didn’t do anything wrong. You aren’t
doing anything wrong. Your heart is
beating like this simply because you’ve
never felt anyone sing before. It was
overwhelming. You had a normal
reaction to an overwhelming event.
That’s all.
My eyes are still closed, and my arm
is still underneath her. I should move it,
but I’m still trying to recover.
And I really want to hear another
song.
This might be making her
uncomfortable, but I have to get her to
push through her discomfort, because I
can’t think of any other situation where
I’ll be able to do this.
Me: Can I play another one?
She’s holding her phone, texting
someone who’s not me. I wonder if
she’s texting Hunter, but I don’t peek at
her phone, as much as I want to.
Sydney: Okay. The first one didn’t do
anything for you?
I laugh. I think it did a little too much,
in more ways than I’d like to admit. I’m
almost positive it was also obvious to
her by the end of the song, with the way I
was pressed against her. But feeling her
voice and what it was doing to all the
other parts of me was way more
important than what she was doing to
me.
Me: I’ve never “listened” to anyone like
that before. It was incredible. I don’t
even know how to describe it. I mean,
you were here, and you were the one
singing, so I guess you don’t really
need me to describe it. But I don’t
know. I wish you could have felt that.
Sydney: You’re welcome, I guess. I’m
not really doing anything profound
here.
Me: I’ve always wanted to feel
someone sing one of my songs, but it
would be a little awkward doing this
with one of the guys in the band. Know
what I mean?
She laughs, then nods.
Me: I’ll play the one we practiced last
night, and then I want to play this last
one again. Are you okay? If you’re
tired of singing, just tell me.
Sydney: I’m good.
She lays down her phone, and I
reposition myself against her chest. My
entire body is battling itself. My left
brain is telling me this is somehow
wrong, my right brain is wanting to hear
her sing again, my stomach is nowhere to
be found, and my heart is punching itself
in the face with one arm and hugging
itself with the other.
I might never have this opportunity
again, so I wrap my arm over her and
begin playing. I close my eyes and
search for the beat of her heart, which
has slowed down some since the first
song. The vibration of her voice meets
my cheek, and I swear my heart flinches.
She feels the way I imagined a voice
would feel during a song but multiplied
by a thousand. I focus on how her voice
blends with the vibration of the guitar,
and I’m in complete awe.
I want to feel the range of her voice,
but it’s hard without using my hands to
feel it. I pull my hand away from the
guitar and stop playing. Just like that, she
stops singing. I shake my head no and
motion a circle in the air with my finger,
wanting her to keep singing even though
I’m no longer playing the chords.
Her voice picks back up, and I keep
my ear pressed firmly to her chest while
I lay my palm flat against her stomach.
Her muscles clench beneath my hand, but
she doesn’t stop singing. I can feel her
voice everywhere. I can feel it in my
head, in my chest, against my hand.
I relax against her and listen to the
sound of a voice for the very first time.
• • •
I wrap my arm around Maggie’s waist
and pull her in closer. I can feel her
struggling beneath me, so I pull her even
tighter. I’m not ready for her to go home
yet. Her hand smacks my forehead, and
she’s lifting me off her chest as she
attempts to wiggle out from beneath me.
I roll onto my back to let her off the
bed, but instead, she’s slapping my
cheeks. I open my eyes and look up to
see Sydney hovering over me. Her mouth
is moving, but my vision is too fogged
over to see what she’s trying to say. Not
to mention that the strobe light isn’t
helping.
Wait. I don’t have a strobe light.
I sit straight up on the bed. Sydney
hands me my phone and begins to text
me, but my phone is dead. Did we fall
asleep?
The lights. The lights are going on and
off.
I grab Sydney’s phone out of her hand
and check the time: 8:15 A.M. I also read
the text she just tried to send me.
Sydney: Someone’s at your bedroom
door.
Warren wouldn’t be up this early on a
Friday. It’s his day off.
Friday.
Maggie.
SHIT!
I hurriedly jump off the bed and grab
Sydney’s wrists, then swing her to her
feet. She looks shocked that I’m
panicking, but she needs to get the hell
back to her room. I open the bathroom
door and motion for her to take that
route. She walks into the bathroom, then
turns and heads back into my bedroom. I
grab her by the shoulders and force her
back into the bathroom. She slaps my
hands away and points into my bedroom.
“I want my phone!” she says, pointing
toward my bed. I retrieve her phone, but
before I hand it to her, I type a text on it.
Me: I’m sorry, but I think that’s
Maggie. You can’t be in here, or she’ll
get the wrong idea.
I hand her the phone, and she reads the
text, then looks back up at me. “Who’s
Maggie?”
Who’s Maggie? How the hell can she
not remember . . .
Oh.
Is it possible I’ve never mentioned
Maggie to her before?
I grab her phone again.
Me: My girlfriend.
She looks at the text, and her jaw
tightens. She slowly brings her eyes
back to mine, and she snatches the phone
out of my hand, grabs the doorknob, and
steps back into the bathroom. The door
closes in my face.
So was not expecting that reaction.
But I don’t have time to respond,
because my light is still flickering. I
head straight to the bedroom door and
unlock it, then open it.
Warren is standing in the doorway
with his arm pressed against the frame.
There’s no sign of Maggie.
My panic instantly subsides as I walk
backward and fall onto my bed. That
could have been ugly. I glance up at
Warren, because he’s obviously here for
something.
“Why aren’t you answering my texts?”
he signs from the doorway.
“My phone died.” I reach over to my
phone and place it on the charging base
on the nightstand.
“But you never let your phone die.”
“First time for everything,” I sign.
He nods his head, but it’s an annoying,
suspicious, You’re hiding something
kind of nod.
Or maybe I’m just being paranoid.
“You’re hiding something,” he signs.
Or maybe I’m not being paranoid.
“And I just checked Sydney’s room.”
He arches a suspicious brow. “She
wasn’t in there.”
I glance to the bathroom, then look
back at Warren, wondering if I should
even lie about it. All we did was fall
asleep. “I know. She was in here.”
He holds his stern expression. “All
night?”
I nod casually. “We were working on
lyrics. I guess we fell asleep.”
He’s acting strange. If I didn’t know
him better, I’d think he was jealous.
Wait. I do know him better. He is
jealous.
“Does this bother you, Warren?”
He shrugs and signs back. “Yeah. A
little.”
“Why? You spend almost every night
in Bridgette’s bed.”
He shakes his head. “It’s not that.”
“What is it, then?”
He breaks his gaze, and I can see the
discomfort cross his face before he
exhales. He makes the sign that indicates
Maggie’s name. He brings his eyes back
to mine. “You can’t do this, Ridge. You
made this choice for yourself years ago,
and I tried to tell you then what I thought
about it. But you’re in it now, and if I
have to be the annoying friend to remind
you of that, so be it.”
I wince, because it kind of pisses me
off how he’s referring to my and
Maggie’s relationship. “Don’t refer to
my relationship with Maggie as being ‘in
it’ ever again.”
His expression grows apologetic.
“You know what I mean, Ridge.”
I stand and walk toward him. “How
long have we been best friends?”
He shrugs. “That’s all I am to you? A
best friend? Ridge, I thought we were so
much more than that.” He smirks as if
he’s trying to be funny, but I don’t laugh.
When he sees how much his remarks
have bothered me, his expression
quickly sobers. “Ten years.”
“Ten. Ten years. You know me better
than that, Warren.”
He nods, but his face is still full of
doubt.
“Good-bye,” I sign. “Shut the door on
your way out.” I turn and walk back to
my bed, and when I face the door again,
he’s gone.
Chapter Eight
Sydney
Why am I so pissed? We didn’t do
anything.
Did we?
I can’t even tell what the hell
happened last night before we fell
asleep. Technically, it wasn’t anything,
but then again, it was, which is probably
why I’m so pissed, because I’m so
freaking confused.
First he doesn’t tell me about Hunter
for two solid weeks. Then he fails to
mention that he’s deaf, although I really
have no right to be upset about that.
That’s not something I should feel
obligated to have been told.
But Maggie?
Girlfriend?
How could he fail to mention in the
three weeks I’ve been talking to him that
he has a girlfriend?
He’s just like Hunter. He has a dick
and two balls and no heart, and that
makes him Hunter’s twin. I should
probably just start calling him Hunter. I
should just call them all Hunter. From
here on out, all men shall be referred to
as Hunter.
My father should be thanking the high
heavens that I’m not in law school,
because I am by far the absolute worst
judge of character who has ever walked
the planet.
Ridge: False alarm. It was just Warren.
Sorry about that.
Me: SCREW. YOU.
Ridge: ???
Me: Don’t even.
A few seconds pass with me staring at
my silent phone, and then a knock comes
from the bathroom. Ridge swings the
door open and enters my room, holding
his hands with his palms up in the air as
if he has no idea why I’m upset. I laugh,
but it isn’t a happy laugh at all.
Me: This conversation will require a
laptop. I have a lot to say.
I open my computer as he makes his
way back to his room. I give him a
minute to log on, then I open our chat.
Ridge: Can you please explain why
you’re so pissed?
Me: Hmm. Let me count the ways. (1)
You have a girlfriend. (2) You have a
girlfriend. (3) Why, if you have a
girlfriend, was I even in your
BEDROOM? (4) You have a girlfriend!
Ridge: I have a girlfriend. Yes. And
you were in my room because we
agreed to work on lyrics together. I
don’t recall anything happening
between us last night to warrant this
reaction from you. Or am I mistaken?
Me: Ridge, it’s been three weeks! I’ve
known you for three weeks now, and
you’ve never ONCE mentioned that
you have a girlfriend. And speaking of
Maggie, does she even know I moved
in?
Ridge: Yes. I tell her everything. Look,
it wasn’t an intentional omission, I
swear. You and I have just never had a
conversation where she came up.
Me: Okay, I’ll let it go that you failed to
mention her, but I’m not about to let
everything else slide.
Ridge: And this is where I’m confused,
because I’m not clear on what you
think we did.
Me: You’re such a guy.
Ridge: Ouch? I guess.
Me: Can you honestly say that your
reaction to the possibility of her being
at your door earlier was a normal,
innocent reaction? You were freaking
out that she would see me with you,
which means you were doing
something you wouldn’t want her to
see. I know all we did was fall asleep,
but what about the WAY we fell
asleep? Do you think she would have
been okay with the fact that you had
your arms around me all night and
your face was practically glued to my
chest? And not only that, but what
about the fact that I sat between your
legs the other night? Would she have
smiled and kissed you hello if she had
walked in right then? I doubt it. I’m
fairly certain that would have ended
with me being punched.
Ugh! Why is this upsetting me so
much? I bang my head lightly against the
headboard out of frustration.
Moments later, Ridge appears in the
doorway between our bathroom and my
bedroom. He’s chewing on the corner of
his bottom lip. His features are a lot
calmer than when he was in here just a
few minutes ago. He walks slowly into
my room, then sits on the edge of my bed
with his laptop on his knees.
Ridge: I’m sorry.
Me: Yeah. Good. Whatever. Go away.
Ridge: Really, Sydney. I haven’t been
looking at it like that at all. The last
thing I want is for things to be weird
between us. I like you. I have fun with
you. But if for one second I led you to
believe that something was going to
happen between us, I am so, so sorry.
I sigh and attempt to blink the tears
away.
Me: I’m not upset because I thought
something was going to happen
between us, Ridge. I don’t WANT
anything to happen between us. I
haven’t even been single for a whole
week yet. I’m upset because I feel like
there was a moment, or maybe two,
when—as much as neither of us wants
to cross that line—we almost did. And
you can deal with your actions on your
own, but the fact that I was unaware
that you had a girlfriend was really
unfair to me. I feel like—
I lean my head back against the
headboard and squeeze my eyes shut,
long enough to force back the tears once
more.
Ridge: You feel like what?
Me: I feel like you almost made me a
Tori. I absolutely would have kissed
you last night, and the fact that I didn’t
know you were involved with someone
would have made me a Tori. I don’t
want to be a Tori, Ridge. I can’t tell
you how much their betrayal hurts me,
and I will never, ever do that to another
girl. So that’s why I’m upset. I don’t
even know Maggie, yet you made me
feel like I’ve already betrayed her. And
as innocent as you may be, I’m
blaming you for that one.
Ridge finishes reading my message,
then calmly lies back on the bed. He
brings his palms to his forehead and
inhales a deep breath. We both remain
still as we think about the situation.
After several quiet minutes, he sits back
up.
Ridge: I don’t even know what to say
right now other than I’m sorry. You’re
right. Even though I thought you knew
about Maggie, I can absolutely see
what you’re saying. But I also need
you to know that I would never do
something like that to her. Granted,
what happened between us last night is
not something I would ever want
Maggie to see, but that’s mostly
because Maggie doesn’t understand
the process of writing music. It’s a
very intimate thing, and because I
can’t hear, I do have to use my hands
or my ears to understand things that
come naturally to others. That’s all it
was. I wasn’t trying to cause anything
to happen between us. I was just
curious. I was intrigued. And I was
wrong.
Me: I understand. I never thought for a
second that your intentions weren’t
genuine when you asked me to sing
for you. Everything just happened so
fast earlier, and I was still trying to
recover from the fact that I woke up in
your bed and the lights were flickering.
Then you go and flash the word
“girlfriend” in my face. It’s a lot to
process. And I believe you when you
say you thought I knew about her.
Ridge: Thank you.
Me: Just promise me one thing.
Promise me you will never be a
Hunter, and I will never, ever be a Tori.
Ridge: I promise. And that’s
impossible, because we’re so much
more talented than they are.
He glances up and smiles his smiley
smile at me, which makes me
automatically smile in return.
Me: Now, get out of here. I’m going
back to sleep, because someone spent
the whole night drooling on my boobs
and snoring way too loud.
Ridge laughs, but before he leaves, he
messages me one last time.
Ridge: I’m excited for you to meet her.
I really think you’ll like her.
He closes his laptop, stands, and
walks back to his room.
I close my laptop and pull the covers
over my head.
I hate that my heart is wishing so bad
that he didn’t have a girlfriend.
• • •
“No, she already moved in,” Bridgette
says. Her cell phone is propped up on
her shoulder, and from the sound of it,
she just broke the news to her sister that
I’ve taken the empty bedroom. Bridgette
completely ignores that I’m even in the
same room with her and continues
talking about me.
I know the fact that I haven’t clarified
that I’m not deaf is a little mean, but who
is she to assume I can’t read lips?
“I don’t know; she’s a friend of
Ridge’s. I should have ignored him when
he asked if I would go—in the rain,
mind you—and bring her up to the
apartment. Apparently, her boyfriend
dumped her, and she had nowhere else
to go.”
She pulls a seat out at the bar and sits
with her back facing me. She laughs at
something the person on the other end of
the line says. “Tell me about it. He
seems to enjoy taking in strays, doesn’t
he?”
I grip the remote in my hand and hold
it tightly in an attempt to keep from
hurling it at the back of her head.
“I told you not to ask about Warren,”
she says with a sigh. “You know he
irritates the hell out of me, but I just . . .
dammit, I just can’t stay away.”
Wait. Did I just hear that correctly?
Might Bridgette have . . . feelings?
She’s lucky I like Warren, or the
remote would be greeting her pretty little
head right now. She’s also lucky
someone is knocking at the door loudly
enough to distract me from hurting her.
Bridgette stands up and turns to face
me, pointing at the front door.
“SOMEONE’S . . . AT . . . THE . . .
DOOR!” Rather than answer it, she
walks to her bedroom and closes her
door.
So hospitable, that one.
I stand and make my way to the front
door, knowing it’s more than likely
Maggie. I place my hand on the
doorknob and inhale a steady breath.
Here we go.
I open the door, and standing in front
of me is one of the most beautiful women
I’ve ever laid eyes on. Her hair is
straight and jet-black, and it falls around
two naturally tanned shoulders. Her face
is smiling. Her whole, entire face is
beaming. She’s nothing but a face full of
beautiful white teeth, and they’re smiling
at me, and it’s making me smile back,
even though I really don’t want to.
I was really hoping she was ugly. I
don’t know why.
“Sydney?” she says. It’s just one
word, but I can tell by her voice that
she’s deaf, like Ridge. But, unlike
Ridge, she speaks. And she enunciates
really well.
“You must be the girlfriend!” I say
with feigned excitement. Is it feigned?
Maybe not. Her entire demeanor is
making me feel sunny and happy, and
maybe I am a tiny bit excited to meet
her? Weird.
She steps forward and gives me a hug.
I close the door behind us, and she slips
off her shoes and heads to the
refrigerator.
“Ridge has told me a lot about you,”
she says as she pops open a soda, then
walks to the cabinet for a glass. “I think
it’s great that you’re helping him through
his writer’s block. Poor guy has been
stressing for months now.” She fills her
cup with ice and soda. “So how are you
fitting in? I see you’ve survived
Bridgette. And Warren has to be a pain
in the ass.” She looks at me expectantly,
but I’m still loving the fact that she’s so .
. . Pleasant? Likable? Cheerful?
I smile back at her and lean against
the counter. I’m trying to figure out
exactly how to respond to her. She’s
speaking to me as if she can hear me, so
I reply the same way.
“I like it,” I say. “I’ve never lived
with this many people before, so it’s
taking some getting used to.”
She smiles and tucks a lock of her hair
behind her ear.
Ugh. Even her ears are pretty.
“Good,” she says. “Ridge told me
about your shitty birthday last weekend
and how he took you out for cake, but it
didn’t make up for you never having the
chance to celebrate.”
I have to be honest. It bothers me that
he told her he took me out for cake. It
bothers me, because maybe he’s right
and he does tell her everything. And it
also bothers me because he seems to tell
me nothing. Not that I’ve earned that
right from him.
God, I hate feelings. Or I hate my
conscience. The two are constantly at
war, and I’m not sure which one I’d
rather turn off.
“So,” she says, “we’re going out
tonight to celebrate.”
I pause. “We?”
She nods. “Yeah. Me, you, Ridge,
Warren, if he’s not busy. We can invite
Bridgette, but that’s laughable.” She
walks past me toward Ridge’s bedroom,
then turns to face me again. “Can you be
ready in an hour?”
“Um.” I shrug. “Okay.”
She opens Ridge’s bedroom door and
slips inside. I stand frozen, listening.
Why am I listening?
I hear Maggie giggling behind the
closed door, and it makes me wince.
Oh, yay. This should be fun.
Ridge
“Are you sure you don’t want to stay in
tonight?”
Maggie shakes her head. “That poor
girl needs to have some fun, with the
week she’s had. And I’ve been so
overwhelmed with my internship and the
T word. I need a night out.” She leans
forward and kisses me on the chin. “Do
you want to get a cab so you can drink,
or do you want to drive?”
She knows I won’t drink around her. I
don’t know why she always tries her
reverse psychology on me. “Nice try,” I
sign. “I’ll drive.”
She laughs. “I have to change and get
ready. We’re leaving in an hour.” She
tries to slide off me, but I grip her waist
and roll her onto her back. I know for a
fact that it never takes her more than half
an hour to get ready. That leaves a good
thirty minutes.
“Allow me to help you out of your
clothes, then.” I pull her shirt off over
her head, and my eyes drop to the very
thin, intricately laced bra she has on. I
grin. “Is this new?”
She nods and smiles her sexy smile. “I
bought it for you. Front clasp, just how
you like it.”
I pinch the clasp and undo it. “Thank
you. I can’t wait to try it on.”
She laughs and slaps my arm. I take
off her bra, then lower myself on top of
her and drop my mouth to hers.
I spend the next half hour reminding
myself how much I’ve missed her. I
remind myself how much I love her. I
remind myself how good it feels when
we’re together. I keep reminding myself
over and over, because for the past
week, it felt as if I was starting to forget.
• • •
Me: Be ready in thirty minutes. We’re
going out.
Warren: I don’t want to go, have an
early shift tomorrow.
No. He has to go. I can’t go out with
Maggie and Sydney by myself.
Me: No, you’re going. Be ready in
thirty minutes.
Warren: No, I’m not. Have fun.
Me: You’re going. 30.
Warren: Not going.
Me: Going.
Warren: Not.
Me: Yes.
Warren: No.
Me: Please? You owe me.
Warren: What the hell do I owe you
for?
Me: Let’s see, about a year’s worth of
rent, for one.
Warren: Low blow, man. Fine.
Thank God. I don’t know what Sydney
gets like when she drinks, but if she’s a
lightweight like Maggie is, I don’t think I
can handle the two of them on my own.
I walk to the kitchen, and Maggie is at
the sink, pulling out the bottle of Pine-
Sol. She holds it up to ask if I want any,
and I shake my head.
“Figured I’d save money if I downed
a couple of shots here first. You think
Sydney wants any?”
I shrug but pull out my phone to ask
her.
Me: You want a shot before we go?
Sydney: No, thank you. Not sure I feel
like drinking tonight, but you go right
ahead.
“She doesn’t want any,” I sign to
Maggie. Warren walks out of his
bedroom and sees Maggie pouring a shot
from the Pine-Sol container.
Shit. There goes the hiding spot.
He doesn’t even blink when he sees
her filling her shot glass. “Make it two,”
he says to her. “If Ridge is forcing me to
go out tonight, I’m getting so wasted
he’ll regret it.”
I cock my head. “How long have you
known that wasn’t cleaning solution?”
He shrugs. “You’re deaf, Ridge. You
would be surprised how many times I’m
behind you and you don’t even know it.”
He picks up the shot Maggie poured, and
they both turn their attention to something
behind me. Their shocked expressions
force me to turn around and see what
they’re looking at.
Oh, wow.
I shouldn’t have turned around.
Sydney is walking out of her
bedroom, but I’m not sure if it’s really
Sydney. This girl isn’t wearing baggy
shirts or walking around with her hair
pulled up and a naked face. This girl is
wearing a strapless black dress that’s
anything but simple. Her blond hair is
down and thick, and I’m thinking it
probably smells as incredible as it
looks. She smiles past me and says
“Thanks” to either Maggie or Warren,
one of whom more than likely just told
her how great she looks. She’s smiling at
them, but then she holds her hands up
and yells, “No!” just as a mist of liquid
rains down on me from behind.
I spin around, and Warren and Maggie
are both coughing and spitting into the
sink. Warren is sipping straight from the
faucet, making a face that says he didn’t
enjoy whatever just went down his
throat.
“What the hell?” Maggie says,
scrunching up her face and wiping her
mouth.
Sydney runs into the kitchen with her
hand over her mouth. She’s shaking her
head, trying not to laugh, but she looks
apologetic at the same time. “I’m sorry,”
she keeps saying over and over.
What the hell just happened?
Warren composes himself, then turns
to Sydney. He speaks and signs at the
same time, which I appreciate. He can’t
know how isolating it feels when you’re
in a group of people who hear, but no
matter what, he always signs when I’m
in the room with him. “Did we actually
just almost drink an entire shot of Pine-
Sol?”
He’s eyeing Sydney hard. She
answers him, and he signs her response
for my benefit. She says, “You two
weren’t supposed to drink it. It was
supposed to be Ridge. And no, I didn’t
actually put Pine-Sol in there, idiot. I’m
not trying to kill the guy. It was apple
juice and vinegar.”
She tried to prank me.
And she failed.
I start laughing and text her.
Me: Nice try. That was a valiant effort,
although it backfired.
She flips me off.
I look at Maggie; luckily, she’s
laughing about it. “There is no way I
could live here,” she says. She walks to
the refrigerator and pulls out the milk,
then makes herself and Warren a quick
drink to wash away the aftertaste.
“Let’s go,” Warren says after he
downs the milk and tosses his cup into
the sink. “Ridge is driving cuz I won’t
be able to walk in three hours.”
Chapter Nine
Sydney
I have no idea where we’re going, but
I’m doing my best to appear engaged.
I’m in the backseat with Warren, and
he’s talking to me about the band,
explaining his involvement in it. I ask the
appropriate questions and nod at the
appropriate moments, but my mind isn’t
here at all.
I know I can’t expect the hurt and
heartache to go away this quickly, but
today has been the worst day so far since
my actual birthday. I realize that all the
pain I’ve been feeling hasn’t been quite
as bad because I’ve had Ridge this
week. I don’t know if it’s the way he
brings comedic relief when he’s around
or if it’s because I really was
developing a crush on him, but the times
I’ve spent with him were the only times I
felt remotely happy. They were the only
times I wasn’t thinking about what
Hunter and Tori did to me.
But now, watching him in the front
seat with his hand clasping Maggie’s . . .
I don’t like it. I don’t like how his thumb
occasionally sweeps back and forth. I
don’t like the way she looks at him. I
especially don’t like the way he looks at
her. I didn’t like how he slipped his
fingers through hers when we reached
the bottom of the apartment stairs. I
didn’t like how he opened her door, then
placed his hand on her lower back while
she climbed inside the car. I didn’t like
how they had a silent conversation while
he was putting the car in reverse. I didn’t
like how he laughed at whatever she
said and then pulled her to him so he
could kiss her forehead. I don’t like how
all of these things make me feel as
though the only good moments I’ve had
since last week are now over.
Nothing has changed. Nothing
significant happened between the two of
us, and I know we’ll continue with the
way things have been. We’ll still write
lyrics together. He might still listen to
me sing. We’ll still continue to interact
the way we’ve done since I met him, so
this situation shouldn’t be bothering me.
I know in my heart that I didn’t want
anything to happen with him, especially
at this point in my life. I know I need to
be on my own. I want to be on my own.
But I also know that the reason I’m
feeling so conflicted by this entire
situation is that I did have a little hope.
Although I wasn’t ready for anything
right now, I thought the possibility
would be there. I assumed that maybe
someday, when I was ready, things could
have developed between us.
However, now that Maggie is in the
picture, I realize there can’t be a maybe
someday between us. There will never
be a maybe someday. He loves her, and
she obviously loves him, and I can’t
blame them, because whatever they have
is beautiful. The way they look at each
other and interact and obviously care
about each other is something I didn’t
realize was missing between Hunter and
me. Maybe someday I’ll have that, but it
won’t be with Ridge, and knowing that
diminishes whatever ray of hope shone
through the storm of my week.
Jesus, I’m so depressed.
I hate Hunter.
I really hate Tori.
And right now, I’m so pathetically
miserable, I even hate myself.
“Are you crying?” Warren asks.
“No.”
He nods. “Yes, you are. You’re
crying.” I shake my head. “I am not.”
“You were about to,” he says, looking
at me sympathetically. He puts his arm
around my shoulder and pulls me against
him. “Chin up, little girl. Maybe tonight
we can find someone who will screw
the thought of that jerkoff ex right out of
that pretty little head of yours.”
I laugh and slap him in the chest.
“I would volunteer to do it, but
Bridgette doesn’t like to share,” he says.
“She’s kind of a bitch like that, if you
haven’t noticed.”
I laugh again, but when my eyes meet
Ridge’s in the rearview mirror, my
smile fades. His jaw is firm, and his
eyes lock with mine for a few seconds
before he refocuses on the road in front
of him.
He’s unreadable most of the time, but
I could swear I saw a small flash of
jealousy behind those eyes. And I don’t
like how seeing him jealous that I’m
leaning against Warren actually feels
good.
Turning twenty-two has rotted my
soul. Who am I, and why am I having
these awful reactions?
We pull into the parking lot of a club.
I’ve been here a few times with Tori, so
I’m relieved that it won’t be completely
unfamiliar. Warren takes my hand and
helps me out of the car, then puts an arm
around my shoulders and walks with me
toward the entrance.
“I’ll make you a deal,” he says. “I’ll
keep my hands off you tonight so guys
won’t assume you’re madly in love with
me. I hate cock blockers, and I refuse to
be one. But if anyone makes you
uncomfortable, just look at me and give
me a signal so I can swoop in and pull
you out of the situation.”
I nod. “Sounds like a plan. What kind
of signal do I give you?”
“I don’t know. You can lick your lips
seductively. Maybe squeeze your breasts
together.”
I elbow him in the side. “Or maybe I
can just scratch my nose?”
He shrugs. “That works, too, I guess.”
He opens the door, and we all make our
way inside. The music is overwhelming,
and the second the doors close behind
us, Warren leans in to shout into my ear.
“There are usually booths open on the
balcony level. Let’s go there!” He
tightens his grip on my hand, then turns
to Ridge and Maggie and motions for
them to follow.
• • •
I haven’t had to use the secret code
Warren and I agreed on, and we’ve been
here more than two hours now. I’ve
danced with several people, but as soon
as the song ends, I make it a point to
smile politely and head back to the
booth. Warren and Maggie seem to have
made a nice dent in the liquor stock, but
Ridge hasn’t had a drop. Other than a
shot Warren persuaded me to take when
we first arrived, I haven’t had anything
to drink, either.
“My feet hurt,” I say.
Maggie and Ridge have danced a
couple of times but that was to slow
songs, so I made it a point not to watch
them.
“No!” Warren says, attempting to pull
me back up. “I want to dance!”
I shake my head. He’s drunk and loud,
and every time I try to dance with him,
he ends up butchering my feet almost as
badly as he butchers the moves.
“I’ll dance with you,” Maggie says to
him. She climbs over Ridge in the booth,
and Warren takes her hand. They head
down to the lower level to dance, and
it’s the first time Ridge and I have been
alone in the booth.
I don’t like it.
I like it.
I don’t.
I do.
See? Rotten soul. Corrupted, rotten
soul.
Ridge: Having fun?
I’m not really, but I nod, because I
don’t want to be that annoying,
brokenhearted girl who wants everyone
around her to feel how miserable she is.
Ridge: I need to say something, and I
may be way off base here, but I’m
attempting to improve on how I
unintentionally omit things from you.
I look up at him and nod again.
Ridge: Warren is in love with
Bridgette.
I read his text twice. Why would he
need to say that to me? Unless he thinks I
like Warren.
Ridge: He’s always been a flirt, so I
just wanted to clear that up. I don’t
want to see you get hurt again. That’s
all.
Me: Appreciate your concern, but it’s
unnecessary. Really. Have no interest
there.
He smiles.
Me: You were right. I like Maggie.
Ridge: I knew you would. Everyone
likes Maggie. She’s very likable.
I lift my eyes and look around when a
Sounds of Cedar song begins to play. I
scoot to the back of the booth and look
over the railing. Warren and Maggie are
standing by the DJ’s table, and Warren
is interacting with the DJ while Maggie
dances around next to him.
Me: They’re playing one of your
songs.
Ridge: Yeah? That always happens
when Warren’s around. Are they
playing “Getaway”?
Me: Yeah. How’d you know?
Ridge presses a flat palm to his chest
and smiles.
Me: Wow. You can differentiate your
songs like that?
He nods.
Me: What’s Maggie’s story? She
communicates really well. She seems
to dance really well. Does she have a
different level of hearing loss from
yours?
Ridge: Yes, she has mild hearing loss.
She hears most things with hearing
aids, which is why she also speaks so
well. And she does dance well. I stick
to slow songs when she wants me to
dance with her, since I can’t hear
them.
Me: Is that why Maggie speaks out
loud and you don’t? Because she can
hear?
His eyes swing up to mine for a few
seconds, and then he looks back at his
phone.
Ridge: No. I could speak if I wanted to.
I should stop. I know he’s probably
annoyed by these questions, but I’m too
curious.
Me: Why don’t you, then?
He shrugs but doesn’t text me back.
Me: No, I want to know. There has to
be a reason. It seems like it would
make things a lot easier for you.
Ridge: I just don’t. I get along fine with
how I do things now.
Me: Yes, especially when Maggie and
Warren are around. Why would you
need to talk when they can do it for
you?
I hit send before I realize I probably
shouldn’t have said that. I have noticed
Maggie and Warren do a lot of his
talking for him, though. They’ve ordered
for him every time the waitress has come
by the booth, and I’ve noticed Warren do
it several times this week in different
situations.
Ridge reads my text, then looks back
up at me. It seems I made him
uncomfortable, and I immediately regret
saying what I did.
Me: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean for that to
come out how it probably sounded. I
just meant you seem to let them do
things for you that they wouldn’t
necessarily have to do if you would
speak for yourself.
My explanation seems to bother him
even more than the initial text. I feel as if
I’m digging myself a hole.
Me: Sorry. I’ll stop. It’s not my place to
judge your situation, because I
obviously can’t put myself in your
shoes. I was just trying to understand.
He looks at me and pulls the corner of
his bottom lip into his mouth. I’ve
noticed he does this when he’s thinking
hard about something. The way he
continues to stare at me makes my throat
go dry. I break his gaze, pull the straw
into my mouth, and take a sip of my
soda. When I look back at him, he’s
texting again.
Ridge: I was nine when I stopped
verbalizing.
His text does more to my stomach than
his stare did. I don’t know why.
Me: You used to talk? Why did you
stop?
Ridge: It might take me a while to text
the explanation.
Me: It’s fine. You can tell me about it at
home when we have our laptops.
He scoots to the edge of the booth and
peers over the balcony. I follow his gaze
down to Maggie and Warren, who are
still both hovering around the DJ booth.
When he sees that they’re still occupied,
he moves away from the railing and
leans forward across the table, resting
his elbows in front of him as he begins
to text.
Ridge: They don’t look like they’re
ready to leave, so I guess we have
time now. Brennan and I didn’t luck out
in the parent department. They both
had issues with addiction. They might
still have them, but we wouldn’t know,
because we haven’t spoken to either of
them in years. My mother spent most
of our childhood in bed, doped up on
pain pills. Our father spent most of our
childhood in bars. When I was five, I
was enrolled in a school for the deaf.
That’s where I learned sign language. I
would come home and teach Brennan,
because neither of my parents knew
ASL. I taught him because I was five
years old and had never had a
conversation with anyone before. I
was so desperate to communicate I
was forcing my two-year-old brother to
learn signs like “cookie” and “window”
just so I would have someone to talk to.
My heart sinks to my stomach. I look
up at him, but he’s still texting.
Ridge: Imagine walking into your first
day of school to the realization that
there is actually a way to
communicate. When I saw kids having
conversations with their hands, I was
amazed. I lived the first five years of
my life never knowing what it was like
to communicate. The school began
teaching me how to form words using
my voice, how to read, how to sign. I
spent the next few years practicing
everything I learned on Brennan. He
became just as fluent in ASL as I was.
I wanted him to know it, but I also
didn’t want to use him as my way to
communicate with my parents. So
when I would talk to them, I would
always speak my words. I couldn’t
hear my own voice, of course, and I
know it sounds different when deaf
people speak, but I wanted a way to
communicate with them since they
didn’t know ASL. One day, when I was
talking to my father, he told Brennan to
tell me to shut up, then had Brennan
speak for me. I didn’t understand why,
but he was angry. Every time I would
try to talk to my father after that, the
same thing would happen, and he
would tell Brennan to tell me to stop
voicing my words. Brennan would
translate what my father wanted him to
say back to me. I finally realized my
father didn’t want me to talk because
he didn’t like the way my voice
sounded. It embarrassed him that I
couldn’t hear. He didn’t like for me to
speak when we were in public,
because people would know I was
deaf, so he would tell me to shut up
every time I did it. One day at home,
he became so angry that I was still
doing it that he started yelling at
Brennan. He assumed that since I
continued speaking my words,
Brennan wasn’t relaying the fact that
he didn’t want me to speak. He was
really drunk that day and took his
anger too far, which wasn’t
uncommon. But he hit Brennan so
hard upside the head it knocked him
out.
Tears begin to well in my eyes, and I
have to inhale a calming breath.
Ridge: He was only six years old,
Sydney. Six. I never wanted to give my
father another reason to hit him, so
that was the last day I ever spoke out
loud. I guess it just became habit after
that.
He lays his phone on the table and
folds his arms in front of him. He
doesn’t seem to be waiting for a
response from me. He may not even
want one. He watches me, and I know he
sees the tears falling down my cheeks,
but he doesn’t react to them. I take a
deep breath, then reach over and pick up
a napkin and wipe my eyes. I wish he
wouldn’t see me responding like this but
I can’t hold it back. He smiles softly and
begins to reach across the table for my
hand, and then Warren and Maggie
reappear at the booth.
Ridge pulls his hand back and looks
up at them. Maggie’s arms are draped
across Warren’s shoulders, and she’s
laughing at nothing in particular. Warren
keeps trying to grab the back of the booth
—it looks as if he’s about to need
support, too, but he can’t seem to grasp
anything. Ridge and I both stand up and
assist them. Ridge pulls Maggie off
Warren, and I wrap Warren’s arm
around my shoulders. He presses his
forehead to mine.
“Syd, I’m so happy you got cheated
on. I’m so happy you moved in.”
I laugh and push his face away from
mine. Ridge nods his head toward the
exit, and I nod in agreement. Another
drink, and we would probably have to
carry these two out.
“I like that dress you wear, Syd. That
blue one? But please don’t wear it
again.” Warren is leaning his head
against mine as we make our way
toward the stairs. “I don’t like your ass
in it, because I think I might love
Bridgette, and your dress makes me love
your ass.”
Wow. He’s really drunk if he’s
admitting that he might love Bridgette.
“I already told you I was burning that
dress,” I say, laughing.
“Good,” he says with a sigh.
We reach the exit, and I notice Ridge
is carrying Maggie now. Her arms are
draped around his neck, and her eyes are
closed. Once we reach the car, she
opens her eyes as Ridge tries to stand
her up. She attempts to take a step but
ends up stumbling. Ridge opens the back
door, and she practically falls inside. He
scoots her to the other side of the seat,
and she falls against the door, closing
her eyes again. Ridge steps out of the
way and motions for Warren to climb in.
Warren steps forward and reaches up to
Ridge’s face. He pats Ridge’s cheek and
says, “I feel bad for you, buddy. I bet it’s
really hard not to kiss Sydney, cuz it’s
hard for me, and I don’t even like her
like you do.”
Warren climbs inside the car and falls
against Maggie. I’m thankful that he was
too drunk to sign any of that, because I
know that Ridge didn’t understand what
he said. I can tell by the confused look
Ridge is giving me. He laughs and bends
down, lifting Warren’s leg, which is still
hanging out of the car. He pushes it
inside the car and closes the door, and
my mind is still stuck on Warren’s
words.
Ridge reaches in front of me and pulls
on the handle of the front passenger
door, then opens it. I step forward, but
the second Ridge’s hand rests against my
lower back, I pause.
I glance up at him, and he’s looking
straight down at me. His hand remains
on my lower back as I force myself to
slowly close the gap between myself and
the car. The second I begin to lower
myself into the seat, his hand slips away,
and he waits until I’m all the way inside
the car, then closes the door.
I lean my head back into the seat and
close my eyes, terrified of what that
simple gesture just did to me.
I hear him take his position behind the
wheel, and the car cranks, but I continue
to keep my eyes closed. I don’t want to
look at him. I don’t want to feel what I
feel when I look at him. I don’t like how
every minute I spend with him, I feel
more and more like a Tori.
My phone receives a text, so I’m
forced to open my eyes. Ridge is holding
his phone, watching me.
Ridge: She doesn’t do this a lot.
Probably not even three times a year.
She’s been under a lot of stress lately,
and she likes to go out. It helps.
Me: I wasn’t judging her.
Ridge: I know. I just wanted you to
know she’s not a raging alcoholic like I
am.
He winks at me, and I laugh. I glance
into the backseat, where Warren is
draped across Maggie. They’re both out
cold. I turn back around in my seat and
text him again.
Me: Thank you for telling me all that
earlier. You didn’t have to, and I know
you probably didn’t want to, but thank
you.
He gives me a sideways glance, then
returns his attention to his phone.
Ridge: I’ve never told anyone that
story. Not even Brennan. He was
probably too young to even remember
it.
He sets his phone down and puts the
car in reverse, then begins to back out.
Why is it that the only question I wish
I could ask him right now is the most
inappropriate one? I want to ask him if
he’s ever told Maggie, but his answer
shouldn’t matter to me. It shouldn’t
matter at all, but it does.
He begins to drive, and he reaches
down and turns on the radio, which
confuses me. He can’t hear it, so I don’t
understand why he would care if it was
on or off.
But then I realize he didn’t do it for
himself.
He turned it on for me.
Ridge
After stopping at a drive-thru for food,
we pull up to the apartment complex. I
put the car in park.
Me: Take the food up and unlock the
door while I wake them up.
She picks up our two drinks and the
bag of food. She heads up to the
apartment, and I walk to the back door
and open it. I shake Warren awake and
help him out of the car. Then I wake
Maggie up and help her out. She’s still
too out of it to walk, so I pick her up and
shut the door behind me. I make sure
Warren walks ahead of me up the stairs,
because I’m not positive he won’t fall
down them.
When we make it inside, Warren
stumbles to his bedroom, and I walk
Maggie into my room. I lay her on the
bed and take off her shoes, then her
clothes. I pull the covers over her, then
head back into the dining room, where
Sydney has laid out our food. It’s almost
midnight, and we haven’t eaten since
lunch. I take a seat in front of her.
Me: So now that you know one of my
deep, dark secrets, I want to know one
of yours.
We both have our phones out on the
table while we eat. She smiles and
begins to text me back.
Sydney: You have more than one
deep, dark secret?
Me: We’re talking about you right now.
If we’re going to be working together, I
need to know what I’m getting myself
into. Tell me about your family. Any
raging alcoholics?
Sydney: No, just raging assholes. My
father is a lawyer, and he hates that
I’m not going to law school. My mother
stays home. She’s never worked a day
in her life. She’s a great mom, but
she’s also one of those perfect moms,
you know? Think Leave It to Beaver
meets Stepford Wives.
Me: Siblings?
Sydney: Nope. Only child.
Me: I wouldn’t have pegged you as an
only child. Nor would I have guessed
you were a lawyer’s daughter.
Sydney: Why? Because I’m not
pretentious and spoiled?
I smile at her and nod.
Sydney: Well, thanks. I try.
Me: I don’t mean for this to come off
as insensitive, but if your father is a
lawyer and you still have a relationship
with your parents, why did you not call
them last week? When you had
nowhere to go?
Sydney: The primary thing my mother
instilled in me was the fact that she
didn’t want me to be her. She had no
education and has always been
completely dependent on my father.
She raised me to be very independent
and financially responsible, so I’ve
always taken pride in not asking for
their help. It’s hard sometimes,
especially when I really need their
help, but I always get by. I also don’t
ask for their help because my father
would point out in a not-so-nice way
that if I were in law school, he’d be
paying for it.
Me: Wait. You’re paying for school on
your own? But if you changed your
major to prelaw, your father would pay
for it?
She nods.
Me: That’s not really fair.
Sydney: Like I said, my father is an
asshole. But I don’t go around blaming
my parents for everything. I have a lot
to be thankful for. I’ve grown up in a
relatively normal household, both of my
parents are alive and well, and they
support me to an extent. They’re better
than most, just worse than some. I hate
it when people spend their entire lives
blaming their parents for every bad
thing that happens to them.
Me: Yeah. I completely agree, which is
why I was emancipated at sixteen.
Decided to take my life into my own
hands.
Sydney: Really? What about
Brennan?
Me: I took him with me. The courts
thought he stayed with my parents, but
he moved in with me. Well, with
Warren. We’ve been friends since we
were fourteen. Both of his parents are
deaf, which is how he knows ASL.
Once I became emancipated, they
allowed me and Brennan to stay with
them. My parents still had
guardianship over Brennan, but as far
as they were concerned, I did them a
huge favor by taking him off their
hands.
Sydney: Well, that was incredibly
considerate of Warren’s parents.
Me: Yes, they’re great people. Not
sure why Warren turned out the way
he did, though.
She laughs.
Sydney: Did they continue to raise
Brennan after you left for college?
Me: No, we actually only stayed with
them for seven months. When I turned
seventeen, I moved us into an
apartment. I dropped out of school and
got a GED so I could start college
sooner.
Sydney: Wow. So you raised your
brother?
Me: Hardly. Brennan lived with me, but
he was never the type who could be
raised. He was fourteen when we got
our own place. I was only seventeen.
As much as I’d like to say I was the
responsible, mature adult, I was quite
the opposite. Our apartment became
the hangout for everyone who knew
us, and Brennan partied just as hard
as I did.
Sydney: That shocks me. You seem
so responsible.
Me: I wasn’t as wild as I probably
could have been, being on my own at
that young an age. Luckily, all our
money went to bills and rent, so I
never got into any bad habits. We just
liked to have fun. Our band was
formed when Brennan was sixteen and
I was nineteen, so that took up a lot of
our time. That’s also the year I started
dating Maggie, and I calmed down a
lot after that.
Sydney: You’ve been with Maggie
since you were nineteen?
I nod but don’t text her back. My food
has hardly been touched from all the
texting, so I pick up my burger. She does
the same, and we eat until both of us are
finished. We stand up and clear off the
table. Then she gives me a wave and
heads off to her room. I sit on the couch
and turn on the TV. After about fifteen
minutes of channel surfing, I finally stop
on a movie channel. The captioning has
been turned off on the TV, but I don’t
bother turning it back on. I’m too tired to
read and follow along with the movie,
anyway.
The door to Sydney’s bedroom opens,
and she walks out, looking slightly
startled when she sees I’m still awake.
She’s in one of her baggy shirts again,
and her hair is wet. She walks back to
her room, then comes out with her phone
and sits on the couch with me.
Sydney: I’m not tired. What are you
watching?
Me: I don’t know, but it just started.
She pulls her feet up and rests her
head on the arm of the couch. Her eyes
are on the TV, but my eyes are on her. I
have to admit, the Sydney who went out
tonight is a completely different Sydney
from the one lying here. Her makeup is
gone, her hair is no longer perfect, her
clothes even have holes in them, and I
can’t help but laugh just looking at her. If
I were Hunter, I’d be punching myself in
the face right now.
She’s beginning to lean forward for
her phone when she cuts her eyes in my
direction. I want to look back at the TV
and pretend she didn’t just catch me
staring at her, but that would make this
even more awkward. Luckily, she
doesn’t seem to care that I was looking
at her, because she gives her attention to
her phone.
Sydney: How are you watching this
without captions?
Me: Too tired to read along right now.
Sometimes I just like to watch movies
without captions and try to guess what
they’re saying.
Sydney: I want to try it. Put it on mute,
and we’ll deaf-watch it together.
I laugh. Deaf-watch? That’s a new
one. I point the remote to the TV and
press the mute button. She turns her
attention back to the TV, but once again,
I fail to look away from her.
I don’t understand my sudden
obsession with staring at her, but I can’t
seem to stop. She’s several feet away.
We aren’t touching. We aren’t speaking.
She isn’t even looking at me. Yet the
simple fact that I’m staring at her makes
me feel incredibly guilty, as if I’m doing
something wrong. Staring is harmless, so
why do I feel so guilty?
I attempt to talk myself out of the
feelings of guilt, but deep down, I know
exactly what’s happening.
I don’t feel guilty simply because I’m
staring at her. I feel guilty for how it’s
making me feel.
• • •
This makes twice in a row I’ve been
woken up like this. I push away the hand
that’s slapping me and open my eyes.
Warren is standing over me. He slaps a
piece of paper on my chest, then whacks
his hand against the side of my head. He
walks to the front door and grabs his
keys, then leaves for work.
Why is he going to work this early?
I pick up my phone, and it says 6:00
A.M. I guess he’s not leaving early.
I sit up on the couch and see Sydney
still curled up at the other end, sound
asleep. I pull the paper from Warren off
my chest and look down at it.
How about you go to your room and
sleep in the bed with your girlfriend!
I wad up the note and stand, then take
it to the trash can and bury it. I go back
to the couch, put my hand on Sydney’s
shoulder, and shake her awake. She rolls
onto her back and rubs her eyes, then
looks up at me.
She smiles when she sees me. That’s
it. All she did just now was smile, but
all of a sudden, my chest is on fire, and
it feels as if a wave of heat just rolled
down the entire length of my body. I
recognize this feeling, and it’s not good.
It’s not good at all. I haven’t felt this
way since I was nineteen.
Since I first began developing feelings
for Maggie.
I point to Sydney’s room to let her
know she should go to bed, then quickly
turn around and head into my bedroom. I
pull off my jeans and T-shirt and softly
slide into bed next to Maggie. I wrap my
arms around her, pull her against my
chest, and spend the next half hour
falling asleep to a broken record of
reminders.
You’re in love with Maggie.
Maggie’s perfect for you.
You’re perfect for her.
She needs you.
You’re happy when you’re with her.
You’re with the one and only girl
you’re meant to be with.
Chapter Ten
Sydney
It’s been two weeks since Ridge and I
have worked on lyrics together. A few
days after Maggie went home, Ridge
ended up leaving for six days because of
a family emergency. He was vague about
what the emergency was, but it reminded
me of when I still lived with Tori and he
was absent from his balcony for several
days. A family emergency was his
excuse then, too.
Based on conversations I’ve heard
Warren have on the phone with Brennan,
I know it didn’t have anything to do with
Brennan. But he’s never mentioned
having family other than Brennan. When
Ridge returned a few days ago, I asked
him if everything was okay and he said
things were fine. He didn’t seem to want
to share any details, and I’m trying to
remind myself that his personal life is
none of my concern.
I’ve immersed myself in school, and
every now and then, I’ll attempt to write
lyrics on my own, but it isn’t the same
when I don’t have the music to go along
with it. Ridge has been home for a few
days now, but he’s spent most of his time
in his room catching up on work, and I
can’t help but wonder if he’s kept his
distance for other reasons.
I’ve been hanging out with Warren a
lot and have learned more about his
relationship with Bridgette. I haven’t
had any more interactions with her, so as
far as I know, she still assumes I’m deaf.
Based on what Warren has told me,
their relationship is anything but typical.
Warren never met Bridgette before she
moved in six months ago, but she’s a
longtime friend of Brennan’s. Warren
says that he and Bridgette don’t get along
at all, and during the day, they live
separate lives. But at night, it’s a
completely different story. He has tried
to go into more detail than I care to hear,
so I force him to shut up when he begins
to overshare.
I’m really wishing he would shut up
right now, because he’s in the midst of
one of his oversharing moments. I have
to leave for class in half an hour, and
I’m trying to finish reading a last-minute
chapter, but he’s intent on telling me all
about last night and how he wouldn’t let
her take her Hooters uniform off because
he likes to role-play, and oh, my God,
why does he think I care to hear this?
Luckily, Bridgette walks out of her
room, and it’s more than likely the first
time I’ve ever been happy to see her.
“Good morning, Bridgette,” Warren
says, his eyes following her across the
living room. “Sleep well?”
“Screw you, Warren,” she says in
return.
I’m beginning to understand that this is
their typical morning greeting. She walks
into the kitchen and glances at me, then
at Warren seated next to me on the
couch. She narrows her eyes at him and
turns toward the refrigerator. Ridge is at
the dining-room table, concentrating on
his laptop.
“I don’t like how she’s up your ass all
the time,” Bridgette says with her back
to me.
Warren looks at me and laughs.
Apparently, Bridgette still assumes I
can’t hear her, but I’m not finding much
humor in the fact that she’s talking shit
about me.
She spins around and eyes Warren.
“You think that’s funny?” she says to
him. “The girl obviously has it bad for
you, and you can’t even respect me
enough to distance yourself from her
until I’m out of the house?” She turns her
back to us again. “First she gives Ridge
some sob story so he’ll let her move in,
and now she’s taking advantage of the
fact that you know sign language so she
can flirt with you.”
“Bridgette, stop.” Warren isn’t
laughing anymore, because he can see
how white my knuckles are, clasped
around my book. I think he’s afraid
Bridgette’s about to get hit upside the
head with a hardback. He’s right to be
afraid.
“You stop, Warren,” she says, turning
back around to face him. “Either stop
crawling into bed with me at night or
stop shacking up on the couch with her
during the day.”
I drop my book onto my lap with a
loud slap, then kick my feet up and down
against the floor out of frustration, anger,
and flat-out annoyance. I can’t put up
with this girl for another second.
“Bridgette, please!” I yell. “Shut up!
Shut up, shut up, shut up! Christ! I don’t
know why you think I’m deaf, and I’m
definitely not a whore, and I’m not using
sign language to flirt with Warren. I
don’t even know sign language. And
from now on, please stop yelling when
you speak to me!”
Bridgette cocks her pretty little head,
and her mouth hangs open in shock. She
silently stares at me for several seconds.
No one in the room makes a move. She
turns her attention to Warren, and the
anger in her eyes is replaced with hurt.
She immediately looks away once the
hurt takes over, and she heads straight
back to her room.
I glance over to see Ridge staring at
me, more than likely wondering what the
hell just happened. I lean my head back
against the couch and sigh.
I was hoping that would feel good, but
it didn’t feel good at all.
“Well,” Warren says, “there goes my
chance to act out all the role-playing
scenes I’ve been imagining. Thanks a
lot, Sydney.”
“Screw you, Warren,” I say,
understanding a little bit where
Bridgette’s attitude comes from.
I slide my book off my lap and stand
up, then walk to Bridgette’s door. I
knock, but she doesn’t open it. I knock
again, turn the knob, and push the door
slightly open to peek inside.
“Bridgette?”
A pillow meets the back of the door
with a thud. “Get the hell out of my
room!”
I ignore her and open the door a little
further until I can see her. She’s sitting
on her bed, with her knees pulled up to
her chest. When she sees me coming into
her room, she quickly wipes her eyes,
then turns the other way.
She’s crying, and now I really feel
shitty. I walk to her bed and sit on the
edge of it, as far out of her reach as
possible. I may feel bad, but I’m still
scared to death of her.
“I’m sorry,” I say.
She rolls her eyes and falls back onto
the bed in a huff. “You are not,” she
says. “I don’t blame you. I deserved it.”
I tilt my head. Did she really just
admit that she deserved it? “I’m not
gonna lie, Bridgette. You are kind of a
bitch.”
She laughs softly, then folds her arm
over her eyes. “God, I know. I just get so
annoyed with people, but I can’t help it.
It’s not like it’s my goal in life to be a
bitch.”
I lie back on the bed with her. “So
don’t be one, then. It takes way more
effort to be a bitch than it does to not be
one.”
She shakes her head. “You can say
that because you’re not a bitch.”
I sigh. She may not think I’m a bitch,
but I sure have been feeling like one
lately. “For what it’s worth, I’m more
evil than you might think. I may not
express my feelings in quite the same
fashion as you, but I definitely have evil
thoughts. And lately, evil intentions. I’m
beginning to think I’m not as nice as I
always thought I was.”
Bridgette doesn’t respond to my
admission for a few quiet moments. She
finally sighs heavily and sits up on the
bed. “Can I ask you something? Now
that I know you can actually answer
me?”
I sit up, too, and nod.
“Are you and Warren . . .” She
pauses. “You guys seem to get along
really well, and I was curious if . . .”
I smile, because I know where she’s
going with this, and I interrupt her string
of thought. “Warren and I are friends,
and we could never be more than
friends. He’s sort of oddly infatuated
with this bitchy Hooters waitress he
knows.”
Bridgette smiles, but then she quickly
stops smiling and looks straight at me.
“How long has Warren known that I
thought you were deaf?”
I think back on the past few weeks.
“Since the morning after I moved in?” I
wince, knowing Warren’s about to
experience the side of Bridgette we all
know too well. “But please go easy on
him, Bridgette. As strangely as you two
show it, he really does like you. He
might even love you, but he was drunk
when he said that, so I don’t know for
sure.”
If it’s possible to hear a heart stop, I
just heard hers come to a screeching
halt. “He said that?”
I nod. “A couple of weeks ago. We
were leaving the club, and he was
wasted, but he said something about how
he’s pretty sure he might love you. I
probably shouldn’t be telling you this,
though.”
She drops her eyes to the floor and is
quiet for several seconds, then looks
back up at me. “You know, most things
people say when they’re drunk are more
accurate and honest than the things they
say when they’re sober.”
I nod, unsure if that’s a true fact or
just a Bridgette fact. She stands up and
walks swiftly to the door, then swings it
open.
Oh, no.
She’s about to kill Warren, and it’s
partly my fault. I stand up and rush to the
door, prepared to catch the blame for
telling her what Warren said. However,
once I reach the living room, she’s
swinging her leg over his, sliding onto
his lap. Warren’s eyes are wide, and
he’s looking at her in fear, which tells
me this isn’t one of her usual moves.
Bridgette takes Warren’s face in her
hands, and he hesitantly brings his hands
to her lower back. She sighs, staring him
hard in the eyes. “I can’t believe I’m
falling in love with such a stupid, stupid
asshole,” she says to him.
He stares at her for several seconds
while her comment registers, and then
his hands fly up to the back of her head
and he crashes their lips together. He
scoots forward and stands with
Bridgette wrapped around him. Then,
without breaking for air, he takes her
directly to his bedroom, where the door
shuts behind them.
I’m smiling, because Bridgette is
more than likely the only girl in
existence who could pull off calling
someone an asshole and in the same
breath confess her love. And oddly
enough, Warren is probably one of the
few guys who would find that appealing.
They’re perfect for each other.
Ridge: How in the hell did you pull that
one off? I was waiting for her to come
out here and strangle him. You spend
two minutes with her, and she’s all over
him.
Me: She’s actually not as bad as she
seems.
Ridge: Really?
Me: Well, maybe she is. But I guess I
admire that about her. She’s true to
herself.
Ridge smiles, sets his phone down,
and drops his eyes back to his laptop.
There’s something different about him
now. I can’t pinpoint exactly what it is,
but I can see it in his eyes. He looks
distraught. Or sad. Or maybe just tired?
He actually looks like a little bit of all
three, and it makes me hurt for him.
When I first met him, he seemed to have
everything together. Now that I’ve gotten
to know him better, I’m beginning to
think that’s not the case. The guy
standing in front of me right now looks
as if his life is a mess, and I haven’t
even begun to scratch the surface.
Ridge: I’m still a little behind on work,
but I should be caught up by tonight. If
you feel like running through a new
song, you know where to find me.
Me: Sounds good. I have an afternoon
study group, but I’ll be back by seven.
He smiles halfheartedly and heads to
his room. I know I’m beginning to
understand most of his expressions. The
one he just shot me was definitely a look
of nervousness.
Ridge
I assumed she didn’t feel like writing
tonight when she didn’t show, and I told
myself I was okay with that.
However, it’s a few minutes past
eight, and my light just flickered. I can’t
ignore the rush of adrenaline pumping
through me. I tell myself my body is
having the reaction it’s having because
I’m passionate about writing music, but
if that were the case, why don’t I get this
excited when I write alone? Or with
Brennan?
I close my eyes and gently lay my
guitar next to me while inhaling a steady
breath. It’s been weeks since we’ve
done this. Since the night she let me hear
her sing and it completely changed the
dynamic of our working relationship.
That’s not her fault, though. I’m not
even sure if it’s my fault. It’s nature’s
fault, because attraction is an ugly beast,
and I’ll be damned if I don’t conquer it.
I can do this.
I open the door to my bedroom and
step aside while she comes in with her
notebook and her laptop. She walks
confidently toward the bed and drops
down onto it, then opens her laptop. I sit
back down and open mine.
Sydney: I couldn’t pay attention in
class today, because all I wanted to do
was write lyrics. I wouldn’t let myself
write any, though, because it comes
so much better when you play. I’ve
missed this. I didn’t think I would like it
at first, and it made me nervous, but I
love writing lyrics. Love, love, love it.
Let’s go, I’m ready.
She’s smiling at me and giddily
patting her palms against the mattress.
I smile back as I lean against the
headboard and begin playing the opening
to a new song I’ve been working on. I
haven’t finished it yet, but I’m hoping
that with her help, we’ll make some
headway tonight.
I play the song several times, and she
watches me some of the time, then writes
some of the time. She uses her hands to
tell me to pause or back up or move on
to the next chorus or to restart the song
altogether. I keep a close eye on her
while I play, and we continue this dance
for more than an hour. She does a lot of
scratching out and makes a heck of a lot
of faces that I’m not sure convey that
she’s having any fun.
She eventually sits up and tears the
paper out of the notebook, then wads it
up and tosses it into the trash can. She
slaps her notebook shut and shakes her
head.
Sydney: I’m sorry, Ridge. Maybe I’m
just exhausted, but it’s not clicking right
now. Can we try this again tomorrow
night?
I nod, doing my best to hide my
disappointment. I don’t like seeing her
frustrated. She takes her laptop and
notebook and starts to walk back toward
her bedroom. She turns back around and
mouths, “Good night.”
As soon as she disappears, I’m off the
bed and digging through the trash can. I
pull out her wadded-up sheet of paper
and take it back to my bed and unfold it.
Watching him from here
So far away
Want him closer than my heart can
take
I want him here I want
Maybe one of these days Someday
There are random sentences, some
marked out, some not. I read all of them,
attempting to work my way around them.
I’d run for him you, if I could
stand
But I can’t make that demand
I can’t be his right now
Why can’t he take me away
Reading her words feels like an invasion
of her privacy. But is it? Technically,
we’re in this together, so I should be
able to read what she’s writing as she
writes it.
But there’s something different about
this song. It’s different because this song
doesn’t sound like it’s about Hunter.
This song sounds a little like it could
be about me.
I shouldn’t be doing this. I should not
be picking up my phone right now, and I
should definitely not be contemplating
how to persuade her to help me finish
this song tonight.
Me: Don’t be mad, but I’m reading
your lyrics. I think I know where your
frustration is coming from.
Sydney: Could it be coming from the
fact that I suck at writing lyrics and a
few songs is all I had in me?
I pick up my guitar and head to her
bedroom. I knock and open her door,
assuming she’s still decent since she just
left my room two minutes ago. I walk to
her bed and sit, then grab her notebook
and pen and place her lyrics on top of
the notebook. I write a note and hand it
to her.
You have to remember the band
you’re writing lyrics for is all guys. I
know it’s hard to write from a male
point of view, since you’re obviously
not male. If you stop writing this song
from your own point of view and try to
feel it from a different point of view,
the lyrics might come. Maybe it’s been
hard because you know a guy will be
singing it, but the feelings are coming
from you. Just flip it around and see
what happens.
She reads my note, then picks up the
pen and shifts back on her bed. She
looks at me and nods her head toward
my guitar, indicating that she’ll give it a
try. I scoot off the bed and onto the floor,
then stand my guitar upright and pull it
against my chest. When I’m working out
chords to a new song, it helps to play
this way sometimes so I can feel the
vibrations more clearly.
I close my eyes, lean my head against
the guitar, and begin playing.
Chapter Eleven
Sydney
Oh, God. He’s doing that thing again.
The mesmerizing thing.
When I’ve seen him play his guitar
like this in the past, it was before I knew
he couldn’t hear himself play. I thought
maybe he just played this way to get a
different angle on the strings, but now I
know he does it so he can feel the music
better. I don’t know why, but knowing
this makes me love watching him even
more.
I should probably be working on the
lyrics, but I watch him play the entire
song without once opening his eyes.
When he finishes, I quickly glance down
to my notebook, because I know he’s
about to open his eyes and look up at me.
I pretend I’m writing, and he flips his
guitar around the correct way, then leans
back against my dresser and begins
playing the song again.
I focus on the lyrics and think about
what he said. Ridge was right. I wasn’t
thinking about the fact that a guy would
be singing them. I was focused on
pouring my feelings onto paper. I close
my eyes and try to picture Ridge singing
the song.
I try to imagine what it would be like
to be honest about what I’m feeling for
him and use that to take the lyrics a little
further. I open my eyes and cross out the
first line of the song, then begin
rewriting the first verse.
Watching him from here
Seeing something from so far
away
Get a little closer every day
Thinking that I want to make it
mine
I think the real reason I’m not able to
write tonight is that every line that ends
up on paper is about Ridge, and I know
Ridge will be able to see through it. He
pulled the lyrics out of the trash and
already read through them, so he has to
have an idea. Still . . . he’s here, wanting
me to finish the song. I focus on the
second verse and try to keep his advice
in mind.
I’d run for him you if I could stand
But I can’t make that demand
What I want I can’t demand
’Cause what I want is you
I continue to go through the lyrics on the
page, crossing out the old lines and
changing them up as Ridge plays the
song several times.
If I could be his, I would wait
And if I can’t be yours now
I’ll wait here on this ground
Till you come, till you take me
away
Maybe someday
Maybe someday
The page becomes messy and hard to
read, so I set it aside and open my
notebook to rewrite everything. Ridge
stops playing for a few minutes while I
transfer everything onto the new page.
When I look up at him, he points to the
page, wanting to read what I’ve written.
I nod.
He walks to the bed and sits next to
me, leaning in toward me to read what
I’ve got so far.
I’m extremely aware that he might see
right through the lyrics and know they
have more to do with him than with
Hunter, which causes panic to course
through my veins. He pulls the notebook
closer to him, but it’s still on my lap.
His shoulder is pressed to mine, and his
face is so close he could probably feel
my breath against his cheek . . . if I were
breathing. I force my eyes to fall where
his have, onto the lyrics rewritten across
the page on my lap.
I try to ignore what you say
You turn to me
I turn away
Ridge picks up the pen and marks
through the last line, then tilts his head to
face me. He points the pen at himself and
makes a writing motion in the air,
indicating that he wants to change
something.
I nod, full of nerves and fear that he
doesn’t like it. He presses his pen to the
paper, next to the lyrics he crossed out.
He pauses for a few seconds before
writing and slowly turns to face me
again. His expression is full of
trepidation, and I’m curious about
what’s causing it. His eyes fall from
mine, slowly grazing over me until his
attention is back on the page. He inhales
and carefully exhales, then begins
writing the new lyrics. I watch him write
out the lyrics to the entire song as I
follow closely along, deciphering the
new lyrics he adds in himself.
MAYBE SOMEDAY
Seeing something from so far
away
Get a little closer every day
Thinking that I want to make it
mine
I’d run for you if I could stand
But what I want I can’t demand
’Cause what I want is you
Chorus:
And if I can’t be yours now
I’ll wait here on this ground
Till you come
Till you take me away
Maybe Someday
Maybe Someday
I try to ignore what you say
You turn to me, I turn away
But Cupid must have shot me twice
I smell your perfume on my bed
Thoughts of you invade my head
Truths are written, never said
Repeat Chorus
You say it’s wrong, but it feels
right
You cut me loose, then hold on
tight
Words unfinished, like our song
Nothing good can come this way
Lines are drawn, but then they
fade
For her I bend, for you I break
Repeat Chorus
When he’s finished writing, he sets the
pen down across the paper. His eyes
turn to mine again, and I don’t know if
he’s expecting me to respond to what he
just wrote, but I can’t. I’m trying not to
allow myself to feel as if there’s any
truth behind his lyrics, but his words
from the first night we wrote together
flash through my head.
“They’re your words, Sydney. Words
that came from you.”
He was telling me then that lyrics
have truth behind them, because they
come from somewhere inside the person
who wrote them. I look back down at the
page.
For her I bend, for you I break
Oh, my God, I can’t. I didn’t ask for this.
I don’t want this.
But it feels so good. His words feel
good, his closeness feels good, his eyes
searching mine make my heart go
haywire, and for the life of me, I can’t
figure out how something that feels like
this can be so wrong.
I’m not a bad person.
Ridge isn’t a bad person.
How can two good people who both
have such good intentions end up with
feelings, derived from all the goodness,
that are so incredibly bad?
Ridge’s expression grows more
concerned, and he pulls his gaze away
from mine and picks up his phone.
Ridge: Are you okay?
Ha. Am I okay? Yeah. That’s why my
palms are sweating and my chest is
heaving and I’m clenching the sheet
beside me on the bed so I don’t do
something to him with these hands that
I’ll never forgive myself for.
I nod, then gently push him aside as I
stand up and walk to the bathroom. I shut
the door behind me and lean against it,
closing my eyes and silently repeating
the mantra in my head that I’ve been
repeating for weeks now.
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, Maggie,
Maggie.
Ridge
After several minutes, she finally walks
back into her bedroom. She smiles at
me, walks to the bed, and picks up her
phone.
Sydney: Sorry. I felt sick.
Me: You okay?
Sydney: Yeah. Just needed water, I
guess. I love the lyrics, Ridge. They’re
perfect. Do we need to run through
them again, or can we call it a night?
I really would like to run through them
again, but she looks tired. I’d also give
anything to feel her sing them again, but
I’m not sure that’s a good idea. I already
beat up my conscience enough while I
was writing the rest of the lyrics down.
However, the fact that I was more than
likely writing about her didn’t seem to
stop me, because the only thing on my
mind was the simple fact that I was
actually writing. I haven’t been able to
write lyrics in months, and in just a
matter of minutes, it was as if a fog lifted
and the words began to flow effortlessly.
I would have kept going if I didn’t feel
I’d already gone way too far.
Me: We’ll call it a night. I’m really
happy with this one, Syd.
She smiles, and I pick up my guitar
and head to my room.
I spend the next several minutes
transferring her lyrics into the music
program on my laptop, and filling in the
guitar chords. Once it’s all entered, I hit
send, close it out, and text Brennan.
Me: Just sent you a very rough draft
with lyrics. I really want Sydney to
hear this one, so if you have time this
week to work up a rough acoustic,
send it over. I think it’ll be good for her
to finally be able to hear something
she created come to life.
Brennan: Looking at it now. I hate to
admit this, but I think you were right
about her. She really was sent to earth
just for us.
Me: Starting to seem that way.
Brennan: Give me an hour. Not busy,
so I’ll see what we can work up.
An hour? He’s sending it tonight? I
immediately text Sydney.
Me: Try not to fall asleep. I might have
a little surprise for you after a while.
Sydney: Um, . . . okay?
• • •
Forty-five minutes later, I get an e-mail
with an attachment from Brennan that
says, Rough cut, Maybe Someday. I
open it on my phone, find a set of
earbuds in the kitchen drawer, and head
to Sydney’s room. She opens the door
after I knock and lets me into her room. I
walk over to sit on her bed and motion
to the spot on the mattress beside me.
She looks at me questioningly but walks
to the bed. I hand her the earbuds and pat
her pillow, so she lies down and places
them in her ears. She continues to watch
me warily, as if I’m about to pull an
elaborate prank on her.
I scoot down next to her and prop
myself up on my elbow, then hit play. I
set the phone down between us and
watch her.
A few seconds pass, and her head
swings in my direction. An “Oh, my
God” passes her lips, and she’s looking
at me as if I’ve just given her the world.
And it feels pretty damn good.
She smiles and puts her hand over her
mouth as her eyes fill with tears. She
tilts her face back up to the ceiling, more
than likely because she’s embarrassed
by her emotional reaction. She shouldn’t
be. It’s exactly what I was hoping to see.
I continue to watch her as she listens,
and her face conveys a mixture of
emotions. She smiles, then exhales, then
closes her eyes. When the song ends, she
looks at me and mouths, “Again.”
I smile and hit play on my phone
again. I continue to watch her, but the
second her lips begin moving and I
realize she’s singing along to the song,
my smile is washed away by a sudden
emotion I didn’t expect to feel at all.
Jealousy.
Never in all my life and in all my
years of living in a world of silence
have I wanted to hear something as much
as I want to hear her sing right now. I
want to hear her so bad it physically
hurts. The walls of my chest feel as if
they’re closing in on my heart, and I
don’t even realize that my hand has
moved to her chest until she turns to me,
startled. I shake my head, not wanting
her to stop. She nods slightly, but the
beat of her heart against my hand is
increasing by the second. I can feel the
vibration of her voice against my palm,
but the material between my hand and
her skin hinders my ability to feel her the
way I want to. I move my hand upward,
until it’s at the base of her throat, and
then I slide it up even farther, until my
fingers and palm are flush against her
neck. I scoot closer to her so that my
chest is pressed against her side,
because the overwhelming need to hear
her has completely taken over, and I
don’t allow myself to think about where
the invisible lines are drawn.
The vibration of her voice stops, and I
feel her swallow as she looks up at me
with the exact emotions that inspired
most of the lines in this song.
Say it’s wrong, but it feels right.
There’s no other way to describe how
I feel. I know that the way I think about
her and feel about her is wrong, but I
struggle so much with how right it feels
when I’m with her.
She’s no longer singing. My hand is
still wrapped around her throat, and her
face is tilted toward mine. I slide my
hand a little higher until it’s grazing her
jaw. I run my finger around the cord to
the earbuds and pull them away from
her. I return my fingers to her jaw,
slowly slipping my hand behind her
neck. My palm conforms so perfectly to
the back of her head it’s as if my hands
were made to hold her like this. I gently
pull her toward me, and she turns her
body slightly toward mine. Our chests
meet, and it creates a force so powerful
that every other part of me is demanding
to be pressed against every other part of
her. She reaches her hands up to my neck
and lightly places her palms against my
skin, then slowly eases her fingers up
and into my hair. Having her so close
feels as though we’ve created our own
personal space, and nothing from outside
our world can make its way in, and
nothing from inside our world can make
its way out.
Her breaths fall in waves against my
lips, and although I can’t hear them, I
imagine they sound like how a heartbeat
feels. I let my forehead fall against hers,
and I feel a rumble from deep within my
chest rise up my throat. The sound I feel
pass my lips causes her mouth to open in
a gasp, and the way her lips are slightly
parted causes my mouth to immediately
connect with hers in search of the relief I
desperately need.
Relief is exactly what I find the
second our lips meet. It’s as if every
pent-up, denied feeling I’ve held toward
her is suddenly uncaged, and I’m able to
breathe for the first time since I met her.
Her fingers continue to sift through my
hair, and my grip tightens against the
back of her head, pulling her closer. She
allows my tongue to slip inside and find
hers. She’s warm and soft, and the
vibrations from her moans begin to leave
her mouth and flow straight into mine.
My lips softly close over hers, and
then I part them, and we do it all over
again, but with less hesitation and more
desperation. Her hands are now running
down my back, and my hand is slipping
to her waist, and my tongue is exploring
the incredible way hers dances against
mine to a song only our mouths can hear.
The desperation and speed at which
we’re escalating this kiss make it
apparent that we’re both attempting to
get as much out of each other as we can
before the moment ends.
Because we both know it has to end.
I grip her waist tightly as my heart
begins to tear in two, half of it remaining
where it’s always been, with Maggie,
and the other half being pulled to the girl
beneath me.
Nothing in my life has ever felt so
good yet hurt so achingly bad.
I tear my mouth away from hers, and
we both gasp for breath as the desperate
grip she has on me keeps me locked
against her. I refuse to allow our mouths
to reconnect as I struggle to figure out
which half of my heart I want to save.
I press my forehead to hers and keep
my eyes closed, inhaling and exhaling in
rapid succession. She doesn’t attempt to
kiss me again, but I can feel her chest as
her movements change from begging for
breath to fighting back tears. I pull back
and open my eyes, looking down on her.
Her eyes are shut tightly, but the tears
are beginning to fall. She turns her face
and covers her mouth with her hand as
she tries to roll onto her side, away from
me. I lift up onto my hands and look
down at what I’ve done to her.
I’ve done the one thing I promised her
I would never do.
I just made her a Tori.
I wince and drop my forehead to the
side of her head and press my lips
against her ear. I find her hand and reach
for the pen beside us on the nightstand. I
turn her hand over and press the tip of
the pen to her palm.
I’m so sorry.
I kiss her palm, then crawl off the bed
and back away. She opens her eyes long
enough to look at her hand. She makes a
tight fist and pulls her hand to her chest,
then begins to sob into her pillow. I take
my guitar, my phone, and my shame . . .
and I leave her completely alone.
Chapter Twelve
Sydney
I don’t want to get out of bed. I don’t
want to go to class. I definitely don’t
want to go job hunting again. I don’t
want to do anything but keep this pillow
pulled over my eyes, because it’s
creating a nice barrier between myself
and every mirror in this apartment.
I don’t want to look in the mirror,
because I’m scared I’ll see myself for
who I really am this time. A girl with no
morals or respect for other people’s
relationships.
I can’t believe I kissed him last night.
I can’t believe he kissed me.
I can’t believe I broke into tears the
second he pulled away from me and I
saw the look on his face. I didn’t think it
was possible to cram so much regret and
sorrow into one expression. Seeing how
much he regretted being in that moment
with me was one of the biggest blows
my heart has ever taken. It hurt worse
than what Hunter did to me. It hurt worse
than what Tori did to me.
But as much as it hurt seeing the regret
on his face, it was nothing compared to
the guilt and shame I felt when I thought
of what I had done to Maggie. What he
had done to Maggie.
I knew the moment he put his hand on
my chest and moved closer to me that I
should have flown off the bed and made
him leave the room.
But I didn’t. I couldn’t.
The closer he moved and the longer
we stared at each other, the more my
body was consumed by need. It wasn’t a
basic need, like a need for water when
I’m thirsty or a need for food when I’m
hungry. It was an insatiable need for
relief. Relief from the want and desire
that had been pent up for so long.
I never realized how powerful desire
could be. It consumes every part of you,
enhancing your senses by a million.
When you’re in the moment, it enhances
your sense of sight, and all you can do is
focus on the person in front of you. It
enhances your sense of smell, and
suddenly, you’re aware of the fact that
his hair has just been washed and his
shirt is fresh out of the dryer. It enhances
your sense of touch and makes your skin
prickle and your fingertips tingle, and it
leaves you craving to be touched. It
enhances your sense of taste, and your
mouth becomes hungry and wanting, and
the only thing that can satisfy it is the
relief of another mouth in search of the
same.
But the sense my desire enhanced the
most?
Hearing.
As soon as Ridge placed the
headphones in my ears and the music
began to play, the hair on my arms rose,
chills erupted from my skin, and it felt as
if my heart rate slowly conformed to the
beat of the song.
As much as Ridge craved that sense,
too, he couldn’t experience it. In that
moment, all of his other senses
combined failed to make up for the one
sense he desired the most. He wanted to
hear me just as much as I wanted him to
hear me.
What happened between us didn’t
happen because we were weak. Ridge
didn’t run his hand up my jaw and
around to the back of my head simply
because I was in front of him and he was
in the mood to make out. He didn’t press
his body against mine because he thinks
I’m attractive and knew it would feel
good. He didn’t part my lips with his
because he enjoys kissing and knew he
wouldn’t get caught.
Despite how hard we tried to fight it,
all of those things happened between us
because our feelings for each other are
becoming so much stronger than our
desire. Desire is easy to fight.
Especially when the only weapon desire
possesses is attraction.
It’s not so easy when you’re trying to
win a war against the heart.
• • •
The house has been quiet since I woke
up more than an hour ago. The more I lie
here and allow myself to think about
what happened, the less I want to face
him. I know if we don’t get it over with,
the confrontation will only be harder the
longer we wait.
I reluctantly get dressed and head to
the bathroom to brush my teeth. His
bedroom is quiet, and he usually has late
nights that result in late mornings, so I
decide to let him sleep. I’ll wait it out in
the living room. I hope Warren and
Bridgette are either occupied with each
other in a bed somewhere or still asleep,
because I don’t know if I can take either
of them this morning.
I open the door and walk into the
living room.
I pause.
Turn around, Sydney. Turn around
and go back to your room.
Ridge is standing at the bar. However,
it isn’t the sight of Ridge that’s rendered
me completely immobile. It’s the girl he
has his arms around. It’s the girl he’s
pressed against. It’s the girl he’s looking
directly at, as if she’s the only thing that
has, does, and will ever matter to him.
It’s the girl who planted herself between
me and my maybe someday.
Warren exits his bedroom and sees
them standing together in the kitchen.
“Hey, Maggie. I thought you weren’t
coming for a couple more weeks.”
Maggie spins around at the sound of
Warren’s voice. Ridge’s eyes move
from Maggie over to me. His body
tenses, and he stands up straighter,
putting a slight distance between the two
of them.
I’m still immobile, or I’d be putting
distance between myself and all three of
them.
“I’m about to leave,” Maggie says,
and signs simultaneously, facing Warren.
Ridge steps away from her, then quickly
breaks his gaze from mine and refocuses
his attention on Maggie. “My grandfather
was admitted to the hospital yesterday. I
got here last night.” She turns and gives
Ridge a light peck on the lips, then heads
for the front door. “It’s nothing serious,
but I’m staying with him until they
release him tomorrow.”
“Oh, man. Sorry about that,” Warren
says. “But you’ll be here the weekend of
my party, right?”
Party?
Maggie nods and takes a step back
toward Ridge. She circles her arms
around his neck, and he wraps his arms
around her waist—two simple
movements that completely shatter entire
sections of my heart.
He rests his mouth against hers and
closes his eyes. He brings his hands to
her face, then pulls back and leans in
again to kiss her on the tip of her nose.
Ouch.
Maggie exits the apartment without
ever having noticed that I was standing
here. Ridge closes the door behind her,
turns around, and brings his eyes back to
mine with an unreadable expression.
“What are we doing today?” Warren
asks, moving his head back and forth
between Ridge and me. Neither of us
breaks our stare to respond to him. After
several seconds, Ridge makes the
slightest movement with his eyes,
motioning toward his bedroom. He turns
to Warren and signs something, and I
walk back to my room.
It’s amazing how many reminders I’ve
had to give my organs in the last three
minutes that should be basic, common
knowledge.
Breathe in, breathe out.
Contract, expand.
Beat, beat, pause. Beat, beat, pause.
Inhale, exhale.
I walk to the bathroom and head for
Ridge’s bedroom. It was obvious he
wants to talk, and I still think confronting
it now is better than waiting. It’s
definitely better than not confronting it at
all. The journey across the bathroom is
only a few feet and should take no longer
than a few seconds, but I somehow
stretch it out for five whole minutes. I
place a nervous hand on his doorknob,
then open it and walk into his room.
He’s walking in at the same time as
I’m closing the door to the bathroom. We
pause and stare at each other. These
staredowns are going to have to end,
because my heart can’t take much more.
We both walk to his bed, but I pause
before sitting down. I assume we’re
about to do some serious talking, so I
hold up my finger and turn to get my
laptop out of my room.
He’s sitting on his bed with his laptop
when I return, so I sit, lean against the
headboard, and open mine. He hasn’t
messaged me yet, so I type something to
him first.
Me: Are you okay?
I hit send, and after he reads my
question, he turns his face toward mine
and appears slightly puzzled. He turns
back to his computer and begins typing.
Ridge: In what sense?
Me: All of them, I guess. I know it was
probably difficult seeing Maggie after
what happened between us, so I just
wanted to know if you were okay.
Ridge: I think I’m a little confused right
now. Are you not pissed at me?
Me: Should I be?
Ridge: Considering what happened
last night, I would say so.
Me: I have no more of a right to be
mad at you than you do to be mad at
me. I’m not saying I’m not upset, but
how will being mad at you help us work
through this?
He reads my message and expels a
huge breath, leaning his head back
against the headboard. He closes his
eyes for a moment before lifting his head
and responding to me.
Ridge: Maggie showed up last night an
hour after I got back to my room. I was
convinced you were going to barge in
and tell her what a jerk I am for kissing
you. Then, in the kitchen earlier, when
I saw you standing outside your door,
I was bracing myself.
Me: I would never tell her, Ridge.
Ridge: Thank you for that. So what
now?
Me: I don’t know.
Ridge: Can we not do the thing where
we brush it under the rug and act like it
never happened, because I don’t think
that’s going to work with us. I have a
lot I need to say, and I’m scared if I
don’t say it right now, I’ll never say it.
Me: I have a lot to say, too.
Ridge: You first.
Me: No, you first.
Ridge: How about we go at the same
time? When we’re both finished
typing, we’ll hit send together.
Me: Deal.
I have no idea what he’s about to say
to me, but I don’t let it influence what I
need to say to him. I tell him exactly
what I want him to know, then I pause
and wait for him to finish typing. When
he finally stops, we look at each other,
and he nods, and we both hit enter.
Me: I think what happened between us
happened for a lot of reasons. We’re
obviously attracted to each other, we
have a lot in common, and under any
other circumstance, I honestly believe
we’d be good for each other. I could
see myself with you, Ridge. You’re
smart, talented, funny, compassionate,
sincere, and a little bit evil, which I like.
;) And last night—I can’t even describe
it. It is by far the most I’ve ever felt
while kissing someone. Although the
feelings aren’t all good. There’s a lot of
guilt mixed in there, too.
So as much as the thought of us being
together makes sense, it also makes
no sense whatsoever. I can’t leave a
relationship with as much hurt as I did
and expect to find happiness within a
few short weeks. It’s too fast, and I still
want to be on my own, no matter how
right something might feel.
I don’t know where your head is, and
honestly, I’m scared to hit enter on this
message, because I want us to be on
the same page. I want us to work
together to try to push past whatever it
is we’re feeling so we can continue to
make music and be friends and pull
ridiculous pranks on Warren. I’m not
ready for that to end, but if my being
here is too hard or makes you feel
guilty when you’re with Maggie, I’ll
leave. Just say the word, and I’ll go.
Well, I guess you can’t really SAY the
word. You could TYPE the word, and
I’ll go. (Sorry for the lame joke at your
expense, but there’s just too much
seriousness going on right now.)
Ridge: First and foremost, I’m sorry.
I’m sorry I put you in that position. I’m
sorry I couldn’t be stronger in that
moment. I’m sorry I broke my promise
to you about never becoming a Hunter.
But I’m mostly sorry for leaving you
crying on your bed last night. Walking
out and leaving that whole situation
unresolved was the worst move I could
have made.
I wanted to come back and talk to you,
but when I finally worked up the
courage, Maggie showed up. If I knew
she was coming, I would have warned
you. After what I did to you last night
and then seeing the look on your face
when you saw us together this
morning, I knew it was one of the most
hurtful things I could have done.
I have no idea what’s going through
your head, but I have to say this,
Sydney. No matter how I feel about
you or how much I think we could
work, I will never, ever leave her. I love
her. I’ve loved her since the moment I
met her, and I’ll love her until the
moment I die.
But please don’t let that take away
from how I feel about you. I never
thought it was possible to have honest
feelings for more than one person, but
you’ve convinced me of how incredibly
wrong I was. I’m not going to lie to
myself and say I don’t care about you,
and I’m definitely not going to lie to
you. I just hope you understand where
I’m coming from and that you will give
us a chance to navigate through this,
because I believe we can. If there are
two people in this world capable of
figuring out how to be friends, it’s us.
We read through each other’s
messages. I read his more than once. I
didn’t expect him to be so forthcoming
and honest, especially about the fact that
he cares about me. I never for one
second expected him to contemplate
leaving Maggie for me. That would be
the worst outcome of all of this. If he left
her and we attempted to build a
relationship from that, it would never
work. The entire relationship would be
built on betrayal and deceit, and those
two things have never made and will
never make for a good foundation.
Ridge: Wow. I’m impressed with us.
We’re both so mature.
His comment makes me laugh.
Me: Yes, we are.
Ridge: Sydney, I can’t tell you what
your message just did for me.
Seriously. I feel like the weight of all
nine planets (because yes, Pluto will
always be a planet to me) has been
crushing my chest since the moment I
walked away from you last night. But
knowing that you don’t hate me and
that you’re not mad and that you aren’t
concocting an evil revenge scheme
feels so damn good right now. Thank
you for that.
Me: Hold on. I never said I wasn’t
concocting an evil revenge scheme. ;)
Also, while we’re being so blunt, can I
ask you a question?
Ridge: What did I tell you about
initiating a question with whether or not
you can propose a question?
Me: Oh, my God, I can’t believe I ever
kissed you. You’re so ANNOYING!
Ridge. LOL. What’s your question?
Me: I’m concerned. We obviously
have an issue with the fact that we’re
attracted to each other. How do we get
past that? I want to write music with
you, but I also know that the few
moments we’ve had that wouldn’t make
Maggie very happy have all been while
we’re writing music. I think I’m just too
desirable when I’m being creative, and
I want to know what I need to do to
lessen my attractiveness. If that’s even
possible.
Ridge: Keep up the egotism. It’s very
unattractive, and if it continues, I won’t
even be able to look at you in a week’s
time.
Me: Deal. But what do I do about my
attraction to YOU? Tell me some
personal flaws that I can engrave into
my memory.
He laughs.
Ridge: I sleep so late on Sundays I
don’t even brush my teeth until
Monday.
Me: That’s a start. I need a few more.
Ridge: Let’s see. Once, when Warren
and I were fifteen, I had a crush on a
girl. Warren didn’t know I liked her,
and he asked me if I would ask her out
for him. I did, and she agreed,
because apparently, she had a crush
on Warren in return. I told him she
said no.
Me: Ridge! That’s terrible!
Ridge: I know. I need a flaw from you
now.
Me: When I was eight, we went to
Coney Island. I wanted an ice cream,
and my parents wouldn’t buy me one
because I was wearing a new shirt that
“June Cleaver” didn’t want me to get
dirty. We were walking by a trash can,
and there was a melted ice cream
cone in it, so when my parents turned
around, I picked it up and started
eating it.
Ridge: Yeah, that’s pretty gross. But
you were only eight, so it really doesn’t
count. I need something more recent.
High school? College?
Me: Oh! One time in high school, I
spent the night at a girl’s house who I
didn’t know very well. We made out. I
wasn’t into it, and it was really gross,
but I was seventeen and curious.
Ridge: No. That does NOT count as a
flaw, Sydney. Jesus Christ, work with
me here.
Me: I like the smell of puppy breath.
Ridge: Better. I can’t hear my own
farts, so sometimes I’ll forget that other
people can hear them.
Me: Oh, my God. Yes, this is the type
of thing that definitely sheds a different
light on you. I think I’ll be good for a
while.
Ridge: One more from you, and then I
think we’ll be equally repulsed.
Me: A few days ago, when I was
getting off the campus bus, I noticed
Tori’s car was gone. I used my extra
key to let myself into her apartment,
because I needed a few things I had
forgotten. Before I left, I opened all her
bottles of liquor and spit in them.
Ridge: For real?
I nod, because I’m too ashamed to
type the word yes.
He laughs.
Ridge: Okay. I think we’re good. Meet
me here at eight tonight, and we’ll see
if we can navigate through a song. If
we need to take breaks from the music
every now and then in order to
replenish our repulsiveness with a few
more flaws, just let me know.
Me: Deal.
I close my laptop and begin to slide
off the bed, but he grabs my wrist. I turn
around, and he’s looking at me with a
serious expression. He leans over and
grabs a pen, then picks up my hand and
writes: Thank you.
I press my lips together and nod. He
releases my hand, and I walk back to my
room, attempting to ignore the fact that
all the repulsive details in the world
couldn’t stop my heart from reacting to
that simple gesture. I look down at my
chest.
Hey, heart. Are you listening? You
and I are officially at war.
Ridge
As soon as she’s out of my bedroom and
the door shuts behind her, I close my
eyes and exhale.
I’m thankful that she isn’t angry. I’m
thankful that she isn’t vindictive. I’m
thankful that she’s reasonable.
I’m also thankful that she appears to
have more willpower than I do, because
whenever I’m around her, I’ve never felt
so weak.
Chapter Thirteen
Sydney
Not much has changed in the way we
practice together, other than the fact that
we now practice five feet apart from
each other. We’ve completed a couple
of songs since “the kiss,” and although
the first night was a little awkward, we
seem to have found our groove. We
haven’t talked about the kiss, and we
haven’t talked about Maggie, and we
haven’t discussed why he plays on the
floor and why I write alone on the bed.
There’s no reason to discuss it, because
we’re both very aware of all of it.
The fact that we’ve admitted our
attraction to each other doesn’t seem to
have eliminated it the way we’d hoped.
For me, it’s like a huge elephant in the
room. It feels as if it takes up so much
space when I’m with him that it presses
me against the wall, squeezing the last
traces of breath out of me. I keep telling
myself it’ll get better, but it’s been
almost two weeks since the kiss, and it
hasn’t gotten easier at all.
Luckily, I have two interviews next
week, and if I get hired, at least it’ll get
me out of the house more. Warren and
Bridgette both work and go to school, so
they’re not here a whole lot. Ridge
works from home, so the fact that we’re
both here alone the majority of the day is
always at the front of my mind.
Out of all the hours in the day, though,
the hour I hate the most is when Ridge is
in the shower. Which means I really hate
this hour, since that’s where he is right
now. I hate where my thoughts go when I
know he’s one wall away from me,
completely unclothed.
Jesus, Sydney.
I hear the water turn off and the
shower curtain slide open, and I squeeze
my eyes shut, trying once again not to
picture him. This would probably be a
good time of day to turn on some music
to drown out my thoughts.
As soon as the door closes between
the bathroom and his bedroom, there’s a
knock at the front door. I gladly jump off
the bed and head toward the living room
to get my mind off the fact that I know
Ridge is in his room getting dressed
right now.
I don’t even bother looking through
the peephole, which is a very bad
oversight on my part. I swing open the
door to find Hunter standing sheepishly
at the top of the stairs. He eyes me, his
expression apologetic and nervous. My
heart drops to my stomach at the mere
sight of him. It’s been weeks since I last
laid eyes on him. I was beginning to
forget what he looked like.
His dark hair is longer since I last
saw him, and it reminds me that I’m
always the one to schedule his hair
appointments. The fact that he hasn’t
even bothered to make his own
appointment makes him that much more
pathetic to me.
“Should I give Tori the number for
your barber? Your hair looks awful.”
The mention of Tori’s name makes
him grimace. Or maybe it’s the fact that
I’m not jumping back into his arms that’s
causing that regretful expression on his
face.
“You look good,” he says, capping his
words off with a smile.
“I am good,” I say, not sure if I’m
lying to him or not.
He runs a free hand over his jaw and
turns away from me, appearing to regret
the fact that he’s here.
How is he here? How does he even
know where I live?
“How did you know where to find
me?” I ask, tilting my head in curiosity.
I see the split-second shift of his eyes
as they glance across the courtyard
toward Tori’s apartment. It’s obvious he
doesn’t want me to notice what’s going
on in his mind, because it would only
shed light on the fact that he’s still
visiting Tori on a regular basis.
“Can we talk?” he asks, his voice
void of the confidence I’ve always
known him to have.
“If I let you in and convince you it’s
over, will you promise to stop texting
me?”
He barely nods his head, so I step
aside, and he walks into the living room.
I walk to the dining-room table and pull
out a chair, making it obvious that he’s
not making himself comfortable by
sitting on the couch. He walks toward
the table as his eyes work their way
around the room, more than likely in
search of information on who lives here
with me.
He grips the back of the chair and
pulls it out slowly while his eyes focus
on a pair of Ridge’s shoes tucked beside
the couch. I like that he noticed them.
“Are you living here now?” he asks,
his voice tight and controlled.
“For now,” I say, my voice even more
controlled. I’m proud of myself for
keeping calm, because I’m not going to
lie and say it doesn’t hurt to see him. I
gave him two years of my life, and all
the things I felt for him can’t just be cut
off at once. Feelings take time to
disappear, so they’re still here. They’re
just mixed and swirled together with a
hell of a lot of hatred now. It’s confusing
to feel this way when I see him, because
I never thought I could dislike the man in
front of me. I never thought he would
betray me the way he did.
“Do you think that’s safe? Just moving
in with some strange guy you barely
know?” He’s eyeing me disapprovingly
as he takes his seat, as if he has the right
to judge any part of my life.
“You and Tori didn’t leave me much
choice, did you? I found myself screwed
over and homeless on my birthday. If
anything, I would think you should be
congratulating me for handling it all so
well. You sure as hell can’t sit here and
judge me.”
He huffs, then leans forward over the
table and closes his eyes, pressing the
palms of his hands against his forehead.
“Sydney, please. I didn’t come here to
fight or make excuses. I came here to tell
you how sorry I am.”
If there’s one thing I’d like to hear
from him, it’s an apology. If there are
two things I’d like to hear, it’s an
apology followed by a good-bye.
“Well, you’re here now,” I say
quietly. “Have at it. Tell me how sorry
you are.” My voice isn’t confident
anymore. In fact, I want to punch myself,
because it sounds really sad and
heartbroken, and that’s the last thing I
want him to think I feel.
“I’m sorry, Sydney,” he says, spitting
the words out fast and desperately. “I’m
so, so sorry. I know it won’t make it
better, but things have always been
different between Tori and me. We’ve
known each other for years, and I know
it’s not an excuse, but our relationship
was sexual before you even met us. But
that’s all it was. It was just sex, and
once you were in the picture, neither of
us could figure out how to just put a stop
to something that had been going on
between us for years. I know this doesn’t
make sense, but what I had with her was
completely separate from what I had
with you. I love you. If you’ll just give
me one more chance to prove myself, I’ll
never speak to Tori again.”
My heart is pounding as hard as it was
the moment I found out they were
sleeping together. I’m inhaling
controlled breaths in an effort not to
climb across the table and beat the shit
out of him. I’m also clenching my fists in
an effort not to climb across the table
and kiss him. I would never take him
back, but my head is so damned
confused right now, because I miss what
we had so much. It was simple and
good, and my heart never ached the way
it’s been aching these past few weeks.
What’s confusing me the most is the
fact that my heart hasn’t been aching like
this because I can’t be with Hunter. It’s
aching because I can’t be with Ridge.
I realize as I’m sitting here that I’m
more upset that Ridge came into my life
than I am that Hunter left it. How
screwed up is that?
Before I can respond, Ridge’s
bedroom door opens, and he walks out.
He’s in jeans and nothing else, and I
tense from the way my body responds to
his presence. However, I love the fact
that Hunter is about to turn around and
witness Ridge looking like this.
Ridge pauses just feet from the table
when he sees Hunter sitting across from
me. He glances from Hunter to me, just
as Hunter turns to see who I’m looking
at. I can see the concern wash over
Ridge’s face, along with a flash of
anger. He eyes me hard, and I know
exactly what’s going through his head
right now. He’s wondering what the hell
Hunter is doing here, just as I am. I nod
in reassurance, letting Ridge know I’m
fine. I shift my eyes to his bedroom and
silently tell him that Hunter and I need
privacy.
Ridge doesn’t move. He doesn’t like
that I just told him to go back to his
bedroom. From the looks of it, he
doesn’t really trust Hunter alone with
me. Maybe it’s the fact that he wouldn’t
be able to hear me if I needed him to
return for any reason. Whatever it is, I
just made him completely uncomfortable
with my request. Regardless, he nods
and turns back toward his room, but not
before eyeing Hunter with a warning
shot.
Hunter faces me again, but his
expression is no longer apologetic.
“What the hell was that?” he asks, his
voice dripping in jealousy.
“That was Ridge,” I reply firmly. “I
believe the two of you have already
met.”
“Are the two of you . . . like . . . ?”
Before I answer him, Ridge walks
back into the room with his laptop and
heads straight to the couch. He drops
down onto the sofa, eyeing Hunter the
entire time while he opens his laptop
and props his feet up on the coffee table
in front of him.
The fact that Ridge refuses to leave
me alone with Hunter pleases me way
too much.
“Not that it’s any of your business,” I
say, “but no, we aren’t dating. He has a
girlfriend.”
Hunter returns his attention to me and
laughs under his breath. I have no idea
what he just found funny, but it pisses me
off. I fold my arms while I glare at him
and lean back against my seat.
Hunter leans forward and looks
straight into my eyes. “Please tell me
you see the irony in this, Sydney.”
I shake my head, absolutely not seeing
any irony in this situation.
My lack of comprehension makes him
laugh again. “I’m trying to explain to you
that what happened between Tori and me
was strictly physical. It meant nothing to
either of us, but you won’t even try to
understand my side of it. Yet you’re
practically eye-fucking your roommate
who happens to be in love with another
woman, and you don’t see the hypocrisy
in your actions? You can’t tell me you
haven’t slept with him in the two months
you’ve been here. How can you not see
that what the two of you are doing isn’t
any different from what Tori and I did?
You can’t justify your own actions
without forgiving mine.”
I’m trying to keep my jaw off the
floor. I’m trying to keep my anger
subdued. I’m trying to keep myself from
reaching across this table and punching
him square between his accusing eyes,
but I’ve learned the hard way that
punching isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.
I allow myself several moments to
calm down before I respond. I glance at
Ridge, who is still eyeing me. He knows
by the look on my face that Hunter just
crossed the line. Ridge’s hands are
gripping the screen of his laptop,
prepared to shove it aside if I need him.
I don’t need him. I’ve got this.
I square up with Hunter, pulling my
gaze off Ridge and focusing on the eyes I
so desperately want to rip out of
Hunter’s head.
“Ridge has an amazing girlfriend who
doesn’t deserve to be cheated on, and
luckily for her, he’s the type of guy who
realizes her worth. With that said, you’re
wrong about the fact that I’m sleeping
with him, because I’m not. We both
know how unfair it would be to his
girlfriend, so we don’t act on our
attraction. You should take note that
simply because a girl makes your dick
hard, that doesn’t mean you have to go
shove it inside her!”
I push myself away from the table at
the same time as Ridge sets his laptop
aside and stands.
“Go, Hunter. Just go,” I say, unable to
look at him for another second. The
simple fact that he thought he had Ridge
pegged as being anything like him pisses
me off, and he’d be smart to leave.
He stands up and walks straight to the
door. He opens it and leaves without
even looking back. I’m not sure if his
exit was so simple because he finally
understands that I’m not willing to take
him back or if it’s because Ridge looked
as if he was about to kick his ass.
I have a good feeling I won’t be
hearing from Hunter anymore.
I’m still staring at the door when my
phone sounds off. I take it out of my
pocket and turn to Ridge. He’s holding
his phone, looking at me with concern.
Ridge: Why was he here?
Me: He wanted to talk.
Ridge: Did you know he was coming
over?
I look up at Ridge after reading his
text, and for the first time, I notice his
jaw is tense and he doesn’t look very
happy. I’d almost label his reaction as
slightly jealous, but I don’t want to admit
that.
Me: No.
Ridge: Why did you let him in?
Me: I wanted to hear him apologize.
Ridge: Did he?
Me: Yes.
Ridge: Don’t let him in here again.
Me: I wasn’t planning on it. BTW,
you’re kind of being a jerk right now.
He glances up at me and shrugs.
Ridge: It’s my apartment, and I don’t
want him here. Don’t let him in again.
I don’t like his attitude right now, and
to be honest, the fact that he just referred
to this as his apartment doesn’t sit right
with me. It feels like a low blow to
remind me that I’m at his mercy. I don’t
bother responding. In fact, I toss the
phone onto the couch so he can’t text me,
and I head toward my room.
When I reach my bedroom door, my
emotions catch up with me. I’m not sure
if it’s seeing Hunter again and having all
of those hurtful feelings resurface or if
it’s the fact that Ridge is being an
asshole. Whatever it is, the tears begin
to well in my eyes, and I hate that I’m
letting either of them get to me in the first
place.
Ridge grabs my shoulder and turns me
around to face him, but I keep my eyes
trained on the wall behind him. I don’t
even want to look him in the eye. He
puts my phone back in my hand, wanting
me to read whatever he just texted, but I
still don’t want to. I throw the phone
toward the couch again, but he intercepts
it, then tries to force it back into my
hand. I take it this time, but I press the
power button down until the phone shuts
off, and then I toss it onto the couch
again. I look him in the eye now, and his
expression is angry. He takes two steps
toward the coffee table, grabs a pen out
of the drawer, and walks back to me. He
takes my hand, but I pull it from him,
still not wanting to know what he has to
say to me. I’ve had enough apologies for
tonight. I try to turn away from him, but
he grabs my arm and presses it against
the door, holding it forcefully while he
writes on it. When he’s finished writing,
I pull my arm away and watch as he
tosses his pen onto the couch, then walks
back to his bedroom. I look down at my
arm.
Let him in next time if he’s really
what you want.
My barrier completely breaks.
Reading his angry words depletes me of
whatever strength I had left to hold back
my tears. I rush through my bedroom
door and straight into the bathroom. I
turn on the faucet and squirt soap into my
hands, then begin scrubbing his words
off my arm while I cry. I don’t even look
up when the door to his bedroom opens,
but I see him out of my peripheral vision
as he closes the door behind him and
slowly walks toward me. I’m still
scrubbing the ink off my arm and
sniffling back the tears when he reaches
across me for the soap.
He dispenses some onto the palm of
his hand, then wraps his fingers around
my wrist. The tenderness in his touch
lashes out and scars my heart. He runs
the soap up my wrist where the words
begin and lathers my skin as I drop my
other hand away and grip the edge of the
sink, allowing him to wash his words
away.
He’s apologizing.
He massages his thumbs into the
words, rubbing them away with the
water.
I’m still staring down at my arm, but I
can feel his gaze directly on me. I’m
aware of the exaggerated breaths I have
to take in now that he’s next to me, so I
attempt to slow them down until there
are no longer traces of ink on my skin.
He grabs a hand towel and dries my
arm, then releases me. I bring my arm to
my chest and hold it with my other hand,
not knowing what move to make now. I
finally bring my eyes to meet his, and I
instantaneously forget why I’m even
upset with him in the first place.
His expression is reassuring and
apologetic and maybe even a little
longing. He turns and walks out of the
bathroom, then returns seconds later
with my phone. He powers it on and
hands it to me while he leans against the
counter, still looking at me regretfully.
Ridge: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean what I
said. I thought maybe you were
entertaining the thought of accepting
his apology, and it upset me. You
deserve better than him.
Me: He showed up unannounced. I
would never take him back, Ridge. I
was just hoping an apology from him
would help me move on from the
betrayal a little quicker.
Ridge: Did it help at all?
Me: Not really. I feel even more pissed
than before he showed up.
As Ridge reads my text, I notice the
tension ease in his expression. His
reaction to my situation with Hunter
borders on jealousy, and I hate that this
makes me feel good. I hate that every
time something Ridge-related makes me
feel good, it’s immediately followed up
with guilt. Why do things between the
two of us have to be so complicated?
I wish we could keep things simple,
but I have no idea how to do that.
Ridge: Let’s go write an angry song
about him. That might help.
He looks at me with a sly grin, and it
makes my insides swirl and melt. Then I
freeze just as fast from the guilt of those
feelings.
For once, it would be nice not to be
consumed with shame.
I nod and follow him to his room.
Ridge
I’m sitting on the floor again. It’s not the
most comfortable place to play, but it’s
much better than being on the bed next to
her. I can never seem to focus on the
actual music when I’m in her personal
space and she’s in mine.
She requested that I play one of the
songs I used to play when I sat out on my
balcony to practice, so we’ve been
working through it. She’s lying on her
stomach, writing on her notepad. Erasing
and writing, erasing and writing. I’m
sitting here on the floor, not even
playing. I’ve played the song enough for
her to know the melody by now, so I’m
just waiting while I watch her.
I love how she focuses so intently on
the lyrics, as if she’s in her own world
and I’m just a lucky observer. Every
now and then, she’ll tuck behind her ear
the hair that keeps spilling in front of her
face. My favorite thing to watch her do
is erase her words. Every time the
eraser meets the paper, she pulls her top
lip in with her bottom teeth and chews
on it.
I hate that it’s my favorite thing to
watch her do, because it shouldn’t be. It
triggers all these what-ifs in my head,
and my mind begins imagining things it
shouldn’t be imagining. I begin to picture
myself lying next to her on the bed while
she writes. I imagine her lip being
tucked in while I’m just inches from her,
looking down on the words she’s
written. I imagine her glancing up at me,
noticing what she’s doing to me with her
small, innocent gestures. I imagine her
rolling onto her back, welcoming me to
create secrets with her that’ll never
leave this room.
I close my eyes, wanting to do
whatever I can to stop the thoughts. They
make me feel just as guilty as if I were to
act on them. Sort of similar to how I felt
a couple of hours ago when I thought
there was a chance she was getting back
together with Hunter.
I was pissed.
I was jealous.
I was having thoughts and feelings I
knew I shouldn’t be having, and it was
scaring the shit out of me. I’ve never had
an issue with jealousy until now, and I
don’t like the person it’s turning me into.
Especially when the jealousy I’m feeling
has nothing to do with the girl I’m in an
actual relationship with.
I flinch when something hits me on the
forehead. I immediately open my eyes
and look at Sydney. She’s on the bed,
laughing, pointing at my phone. I pick it
up and read her text.
Sydney: Are you falling asleep? We
aren’t finished.
Me: No. Just thinking.
She moves over on the bed to make
more room and pats the spot next to her.
Sydney: Come think right here so you
can read these. I have most of the
lyrics down, but I’m hung up on the
chorus. I’m not sure what you want.
We haven’t openly discussed the fact
that we don’t write on the bed together
anymore. She’s focused on the lyrics,
though, so I need to pull my shit together
and focus on them, too. I set my guitar
down and pull myself up, then walk to
the bed and lie beside her. I take the
notebook out of her hands and pull it in
front of me to read what she’s written so
far. She smells good.
Damn.
I try to block off my senses somehow,
but I know it’s a wasted effort. Instead, I
focus on the words she’s written,
quickly impressed at how effortlessly
they come to her.
Why don’t we keep
Keep it simple
You talk to your friends
And I’ll be here to mingle
But you know that I
I want to be
Right by your side
Where I ought to be
And you know that I
That I can see
The way that your eyes
Seem to follow me
After reading what she’s written, I hand
her back the notebook and pick up my
phone. I’m confused about the lyrics,
because they aren’t at all what I was
expecting. I’m not sure I like them.
Me: I thought we were writing an angry
song about Hunter.
She shrugs, then begins texting me
back.
Sydney: I tried. The subject of Hunter
doesn’t really inspire me anymore.
You don’t have to use them if you don’t
like them. I can try something
different.
I stare at her text, not sure how to
respond. I don’t like the lyrics, but not
because they aren’t good. It’s because
the words she’s written down make me
think she’s somehow able to read my
mind.
Me: I love them.
She smiles and says, “Thank you.”
She flips onto her back, and I catch
myself appreciating this moment and this
night and her low-cut dress way more
than I probably should. When my eyes
make their way back to hers, she’s
watching me, plainly aware of what’s
going through my head. Eyes don’t lie,
unfortunately.
When neither of us breaks our gaze,
I’m forced to swallow the huge lump in
my throat.
Don’t get yourself in trouble, Ridge.
Thank God she sits up when she does.
Sydney: I’m not sure where you want
the chorus to come in. This song is a
little more upbeat than the ones I’m
used to. I’ve written three different
ones, but I don’t like how any of them
sound. I’m stuck.
Me: Let me watch you sing it one more
time.
I roll off the bed and grab the guitar,
then take it back to the bed but sit on the
edge this time. We turn to face each
other, and I play while she sings. When
we make it to the chorus, she stops
singing and shrugs, letting me know this
is where she’s stuck. I take her notebook
and read the lyrics over a few times. I
glance up at her without being too
obvious about it and write the first thing
that comes to mind.
And I must confess
My interest
The way that you move
When you’re in that dress
It’s making me feel
Like I want to be
The only man
That you ever see
I pause from writing and look up at her
again, feeling every bit of the words in
this chorus. I think we both know the
words we write have to do with each
other, but that doesn’t seem to stop us at
all. If we keep having moments like
these with words that are way too
honest, we’ll both end up in trouble. I
quickly look back down at the paper as
more lyrics begin to enter my head.
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I’m in trouble, trouble
Whoa, oh, oh, oh
I’m in trouble now
I refuse to look up at her again while I
write. I keep my mind focused on the
words that somehow seem to flow from
my fingertips every time we’re together.
I don’t question what’s inspiring me or
what they mean.
I don’t question it . . . because it’s
obvious.
But it’s art. Art is just an expression.
An expression isn’t the same as an act,
as much as it sometimes feels that way.
Writing lyrics isn’t the same as directly
informing someone of your feelings.
Is it?
I keep my eyes on the paper and
continue to write the words I honestly
wish I didn’t feel.
The second I’m finished writing, I’m
so worked up I don’t allow myself to
witness her reaction to the words. I
quickly hand her back the notebook and
pull my guitar around and begin playing
so she can work through the chorus.
Chapter Fourteen
Sydney
He’s not looking at me. He doesn’t even
know I’m not singing the lyrics. I can’t
sing them. I’ve listened to him play this
song dozens of times from his balcony,
yet it never held emotion or meaning
until this moment.
The fact that he can’t even look at me
makes the song feel way too personal. It
feels as if this song somehow just
became his song to me. I turn the
notebook over, not wanting to read the
words anymore. This song is just one
more thing that never should have
happened, even though I’m positive it’s
my new favorite.
Me: Do you think Brennan can make a
rough cut of this one? I want to hear it.
I nudge him with my foot after I send
the text, then nod toward his phone when
he looks at me. He picks it up to read the
text and nods. He doesn’t reply or make
eye contact with me, though. I glance
back down to my phone as the room
grows quiet in the absence of the sound
of his guitar. I don’t like how awkward
things just got between us, so I attempt to
make small talk to fill the void. I roll
onto my back and type out a question
that’s been on my mind for a while to
break up the stillness around us.
Me: Why don’t you ever practice on
your balcony like you used to?
This question gets me immediate eye
contact from him, but it doesn’t last. His
eyes flicker across my face, down my
body, and finally back to his phone.
Ridge: Why would I? You’re not out
there anymore.
And just like that, my defenses are
down, and my willpower is shot to hell
with his honest reply. I nervously pull
my bottom lip in and chew on it, then
slowly raise my eyes back to his. He’s
looking at me as if he wishes he were a
guy like Hunter who cared only about
himself.
He’s not the only one wishing that.
I want to be Tori right now so much it
hurts. I want to be just like her and not
give a shit about my self-respect or
about Maggie for just a few minutes.
Long enough to allow him to do
everything his lyrics make clear he
wants to do.
His eyes fall to my lips, and my mouth
runs dry.
His eyes fall to my chest, and it begins
to heave deeper than it already was.
His eyes fall to my legs, and I have to
cross them, because the way his gaze
penetrates my body makes it seem as
though he can see right through this dress
I’m wearing.
His eyes close tightly, and knowing
the effect I’m having on him makes me
feel as if there might be a lot more truth
to his lyrics than he’d like there to be.
It’s making me feel like I want to be
the only man that you ever see.
Ridge suddenly stands and drops his
phone onto the bed, then walks straight
into the bathroom and slams the door. I
listen as the shower curtain slides open
and the water kicks on.
I roll onto my back and release all my
pent-up breaths. I’m flustered and
confused and angry. I don’t like the
situation we’ve put ourselves in, and I
know for a fact that even though we
haven’t acted on it again, nothing about
this is innocent.
I sit up on the bed, then quickly stand.
I need to get out of his room before it
completely closes in on me. Just as I’m
walking away from the bed, Ridge’s
phone vibrates on the mattress. I look
down at it.
Maggie: I’m missing you extra hard
today. When you’re finished writing
with Sydney, can we video chat? I
need to see you. ;)
I stare at her text.
I hate her text.
I hate that she knows we were just
writing together.
I hate that he tells her everything.
I want these moments to belong to me
and Ridge and no one else.
• • •
It’s been two hours since he got out of
the shower, and I can’t bring myself to
leave my bedroom. I’m starving, though,
and really want to go to the kitchen. I
just don’t want to see him, because I hate
how we left things. I don’t like that we
both know we almost crossed a line
tonight.
Actually, I don’t like that we did
cross a line tonight. Although we aren’t
verbalizing what we’re thinking and
feeling, writing it in lyrics isn’t any less
harmful.
There’s a knock on my door, and
knowing that it’s more than likely Ridge
causes my heart to betray me by dancing
rapidly in my chest. I don’t bother
getting up to open the door, because he
nudges it open right after knocking. He
holds up a set of headphones and his cell
phone, indicating that he has something
he wants me to hear. I nod, and he walks
over to the bed and hands them to me.
He hits play but takes a seat on the floor
while I scoot back onto the bed. The
song begins to play, and I spend the next
three minutes barely breathing. Ridge
and I never once break our stare
throughout the duration of the song.
I’M IN TROUBLE
Why don’t we keep
Keep it simple
You talk to your friends
And I’ll be here to mingle
But you know that I

Right by your side
Where I ought to be
And you know that I

You keep to your business

Ridge
Maggie: Guess who gets to see me
tomorrow?
Me: Kurt Vonnegut?
Maggie: Guess again.
Me: Anderson Cooper?
Maggie: No, but close.
Me: Amanda Bynes?
Maggie: You’re so random. YOU get to
see me tomorrow, and you get to
spend a whole two days with me, and I
know I’m trying to save money, but I
bought you two new bras.
Me: How did I ever get so lucky to find
the one and only girl who supports and
encourages my transvestite
tendencies?
Maggie: I ask myself that same
question every day.
Me: What time do I get to see you?
Maggie: Well, it all depends on the
dreaded T word again.
Me: Ah. Yes. Well, we shall discuss it
no further. Try to be here by six, at
least. Warren’s birthday party is
tomorrow night, and I want to spend
time with you before all his crazy
friends get here.
Maggie: Thank you for reminding me!
What should I get him?
Me: Nothing. Sydney and I are pulling
the ultimate prank. We told everyone
to donate to charity in lieu of gifts. He’ll
be pissed when people start handing
him all the donation cards in his honor.
Maggie: You two are evil. Should I
bring something? A cake, maybe?
Me: Nope, we got it. We felt bad for
the “no gifts” prank, so we’re about to
bake him five different flavored cakes
to make up for it.
Maggie: Make sure one of them is
German chocolate.
Me: Already got you covered, babe. I
love you.
Maggie: Love you, too.
I close out our texts and open up the
unread one I have from Sydney.
Sydney: You forgot vanilla extract,
dumbass. It was on the list. Item 5.
Now you have to go back to the store.
Me: Maybe next time you should write
more legibly and return my texts when
I’m at the grocery store, attempting to
decipher item 5. I’ll be back in 20.
Preheat the oven, and text me if you
think of anything else.
I laugh, put my phone into my pocket,
grab my keys, and head to the store.
Again.
• • •
We’re on cake number three. I’m
beginning to believe that those who are
musically gifted seriously lack talent in
the kitchen-skills department. Sydney
and I work really well together when it
comes to writing music, but our lack of
finesse and knowledge when it comes to
mixing a few ingredients together is a
little pathetic.
She insisted that we bake the cakes
from scratch, whereas I would have
grabbed the boxed mixes. But it’s been
kind of fun, so I’m not complaining.
She places the third cake in the oven
and sets the timer. She turns around and
mouths “thirty minutes,” then pushes
herself up onto the counter.
Sydney: Is your little brother coming
tomorrow?
Me: They’re gonna try. They open for
a band in San Antonio at seven
tomorrow night, so as long as they get
loaded up on time, they should be here
by ten.
Sydney: The whole band? I get to
meet the whole band?
Me: Yep. And I bet they’ll even sign
your boobs.
Sydney: SQUEEEE!
Me: If those letters really make up a
sound, I am so, so glad I can’t hear it.
She laughs.
Sydney: How did y’all come up with
the band name Sounds of Cedar?
Any time anyone’s asked how I came
up with the name of the band, I just say I
thought it sounded cool. But I can’t lie to
Sydney. There’s something about her that
pulls stories about my childhood out of
me that I’ve never told anyone. Not even
Maggie.
Maggie has asked in the past why I
never speak out loud and where I came
up with the name of the band, but I don’t
like to bring up anything negative that
might cause her even the smallest amount
of concern. She’s got enough to deal
with in her own life. She doesn’t need to
add my childhood issues to that. They’re
in the past and there’s no need to bring
them up.
However, Sydney’s a different story.
She seems so curious about me, about
life, about people in general. It’s easy to
tell her things.
Sydney: Uh-oh. Looks like I need to
prepare myself for a good story,
because you look like you don’t want
to answer that.
I turn around until my back is pressed
against the counter-top she’s sitting on,
and I lean against it.
Me: You just love the heart-wrenching
stuff, huh?
Sydney: Yep. Give it to me.
Maggie, Maggie, Maggie.
I often find myself repeating Maggie’s
name when I’m with Sydney. Especially
when Sydney says things like “Give it to
me.”
The last couple of weeks have been
okay since our talk. We’ve definitely
had our moments, but one of us is usually
quick to begin pointing out flaws and
repulsive personality traits to get us
back on track.
Aside from a couple of weeks ago,
when our writing session ended with me
having to take a cold shower, two nights
ago was probably the hardest time of all
for me. I don’t know what it is about the
way she sings. I can simply be watching
her, and I get the same feeling I get when
I press my ear to her chest or rest my
hand against her throat. She closes her
eyes and starts singing the words, and
the passion and feelings that pour from
her are so powerful I sometimes forget I
can’t even hear her.
This particular night, we were writing
a song from scratch, and we couldn’t
communicate well enough to understand
it. I needed to hear her, and although we
were both reluctant, it ended with my
head pressed to her chest and my hand
resting against her throat. While she was
singing, she casually brought her hand to
my hair and was twirling her fingers
around.
I could have stayed in that position
with her all night.
I would have, if every touch of her
hand didn’t make me crave a little bit
more. I finally had to tear myself away
from her, but just being on the floor
wasn’t enough separation. I wanted her
so bad; it was all I could think about. I
ended up asking her to tell me one of her
flaws, and instead of giving me one, she
stood up and left my bedroom.
The way she had been touching my
hair was a very natural thing for her to
do, considering the way we were
positioned. It’s what a guy would do to
his girlfriend if he were holding her
against his chest, and it’s what a girl
would do to her boyfriend if he were
wrapped around her. But we aren’t those
things.
The relationship we have is different
from anything I’ve experienced. Mostly
because we do have a lot of physical
closeness based on the nature of writing
music together and the fact that I have to
use my sense of touch to replace my
sense of hearing in some situations. So
while we’re in those situations, the lines
become muddy, and reactions become
unintentional.
As much as I wish I could admit
we’ve moved past our attraction for
each other, I can’t deny that I feel mine
growing with each day that passes.
Being around her isn’t necessarily hard
all the time, though. Just most of the
time.
Whatever is going on between us, I
know Maggie wouldn’t approve, and I
try to do right by my relationship with
her. However, since I can’t really define
where the line is drawn between
inappropriate and appropriate, it makes
it hard to stay on the right side
sometimes.
Like right now.
I’m staring down at my phone, about
to text her, and she’s leaning behind me,
both of her hands kneading the tension
out of my shoulders. With as much
writing as we’ve been doing and the fact
that I sit on the floor now instead of the
bed, I’ve had a few issues with my back.
It’s become natural for her to rub it when
she knows it’s hurting.
Would I let her do this when Maggie
was in the room? Hell, no. Do I stop
her? No. Should I? Absolutely.
I know without a doubt that I don’t
want to cheat on Maggie. I’ve never
been that type of guy, and I don’t ever
want to be that type of guy. The problem
is, I’m not thinking about Maggie when
I’m with Sydney. The times I spend with
Sydney are spent with Sydney, and
nothing else crosses my mind. But the
times I spend with Maggie are spent
with Maggie. I don’t think about Sydney.
It’s as though times with Maggie and
times with Sydney occur on two
different planets. Planets that don’t
intersect and in time zones that don’t
overlap.
Until tomorrow, anyway.
We’ve all spent time together in the
past, but not since I’ve been honest with
myself about how I feel for Sydney. And
although I would never want Maggie to
know I’ve developed feelings for
someone else, I’m worried she’ll be
able to tell.
I tell myself that with enough effort, I
can learn to control my feelings. But then
Sydney will do or say something or give
me a look, and I can literally feel the
part of my heart that belongs to her
getting fuller. As much as I want it to
empty. I’m worried that feelings are the
one thing in our lives that we have
absolutely no control over.
Chapter Fifteen
Sydney
Me: What’s taking you so long? Are
you writing a damn book?
I don’t know if my rubbing his
shoulders is putting him to sleep, but
he’s been staring at his phone for five
solid minutes.
Ridge: Sorry. Lost in thought.
Me: I can see that. So, Sounds of
Cedar?
Ridge: It’s kind of a long story. Let me
grab my laptop.
I open up our Facebook messages on
my phone. When he returns, he leans
against a counter several feet away from
me. I’m aware of the fact that he’s put
space between us, and it makes me feel
somewhat uncomfortable, because I
know I shouldn’t have been rubbing his
shoulders. It’s too much, considering
what’s happened between us in the past,
but I feel as if it’s my fault his shoulders
hurt in the first place.
He doesn’t really complain about
what playing on the floor is doing to
him, but I can tell it hurts sometimes.
Especially after nights like last night,
when we wrote for three hours straight. I
asked him to start playing on the floor to
help with the fact that things seem to be
more difficult when he’s on the bed. If I
didn’t still have such a huge crush on his
guitar playing, it might not be as big a
problem.
But I do still have a definite crush on
his guitar playing. And I would say I
have a definite crush on him, but crush
doesn’t even begin to define it. I’m not
even going to try to define how I feel
about him, because I refuse to let my
thoughts go there. Not now and not ever.
Ridge: We had all been playing
together for fun for about six months
before we got our first real gig at a
local restaurant. They needed us to
give them the name of our band so
they could put us on the schedule. We
had never really considered ourselves
an actual band before that, since it
was all in fun, but that night, we agreed
that maybe for local things like the
restaurant, it would be good to have a
name. We all took turns throwing out
suggestions, but we couldn’t seem to
agree on anything. At one point,
Brennan suggested we call ourselves
Freak Frogs. I laughed. I told him it
sounded like a punk band, that we
needed a title with more of an acoustic
sound. He got upset and said I
shouldn’t really be allowed to comment
on how music or titles sound, since,
well, yay for lame deaf jokes from
sixteen-year-old little brothers.
Anyway, Warren didn’t like how cocky
Brennan was back then, so he said I
should choose the name and everyone
had to agree on it. Brennan got pissed
and walked off, said he didn’t want to
be in the band anyway. I knew he was
just having a Brennan tantrum. He
didn’t have them often, but when he
did have them, I understood. I mean,
the kid had virtually no parents, and he
was raising himself, so I thought he
was pretty damn mature despite the
sporadic tantrums. I told the guys I
wanted to think on it for a while. I tried
to come up with names that I thought
would mean something to everyone,
but mostly to Brennan. I thought back
on what got me into listening to music
in the first place.
Brennan was around two years old,
and I was five. I’ve already shared to
you all the qualities my parents
possessed, so I won’t go back into
that. But in addition to all their
addictions, they also liked to party.
They would send us to our rooms at
night once all their friends began to
arrive. I noticed that Brennan was
always wearing the same diapers
when he woke up that he wore to bed.
They never checked on him. Never fed
him at night or changed him or even
checked to see if he was breathing.
This is probably something that had
been occurring since he was an
infant, but I didn’t really notice until I
started school, because I think I was
just too young. We weren’t allowed to
leave our rooms at night. I don’t
remember why I was too scared to
leave my room, but I’m sure I’d been
punished for it before, or it wouldn’t
have bothered me. I would wait until
the parties were over and my parents
went to bed before I could leave my
room and go check on Brennan. The
problem with this was that I couldn’t
hear, so I never knew when the music
would stop, and I never knew if they
had gone to their bedroom, because I
wasn’t allowed to open my door.
Instead of risking being caught, I
would just press my ear to the floor
and feel the vibrations of the music.
Every night, I would lie there for no
telling how long, just waiting for the
music to stop. I began to recognize the
songs based on how they felt through
the floor, and I learned how to predict
which songs were coming next, since
they played the same albums night
after night. I even began to learn how
to tap along with the rhythm. After the
music would finally stop, I would keep
my ear pressed to the floor and wait
for my parents’ footsteps to indicate
that they had gone to their bedroom.
Once I knew the coast was clear, I
would go to Brennan’s room and bring
him back to bed with me. That way,
when he woke up crying, I could help
him. Which brings me back to the
point of this story, how I came up with
the band name. I learned how to
differentiate chords and sounds
through all the nights my body and my
ears were pressed against the cedar
floor. Hence Sounds of Cedar.
Inhale, exhale.
Beat, beat, pause.
Contract, expand.
I don’t even realize how on edge I am
until I see the white in my knuckles as I
grip my phone. We both remain still for
several moments while I attempt to get
the image of the five-year-old Ridge out
of my head.
It’s gut-wrenching.
Me: I guess that explains how you can
differentiate vibrations so well. And I
guess Brennan agreed once you told
him the name, because how could he
not appreciate that?
Ridge: Brennan doesn’t know that
story. Once again, you’re the first
person I’ve ever shared it with.
I lift my eyes back to his and inhale,
but for the life of me, I can’t remember
how to exhale. He’s a good three feet
away, but I feel as if every single part of
me that his eyes fall on is being directly
touched by him. For the first time in a
while, the fear etches its way back into
my heart. Fear that one of these moments
will be one neither of us can resist.
He sets his laptop on the counter and
folds his arms across his chest. Before
his eyes meet mine, his gaze falls on my
legs, and then he slowly works his eyes
up the entire length of my body. His eyes
are narrow and focused. The way he’s
looking at me makes me want to lunge
for the freezer and crawl inside.
His eyes are fixed on my mouth, and
he quietly swallows, then reaches beside
him and picks up his phone.
Ridge: Hurry, Syd. I need a serious
flaw, and I need it now.
I force a smile, although my insides
are screaming for me not to text him
back a flaw. It’s as if my fingers are
fighting with themselves as they fly over
the screen in front of me.
Me: Sometimes when I’m frustrated
with you, I wait until you look away,
and then I yell mean things at you.
He laughs, then looks back up at me.
“Thank you,” he silently mouths.
It’s the first time he’s ever mouthed
words, and if he weren’t walking away
from me right now, I’d be begging for
him to do it again.
Heart 1.
Sydney 0.
• • •
It’s after midnight, but we finally finish
adding icing to the fifth and final cake.
He cleans the last of the ingredients off
the counter while I secure the Saran
wrap around the cake pan and slide it
next to the other four pans.
Ridge: Do I finally get to meet the
raging alcoholic side of you tomorrow
night?
Me: I’m thinking you just might.
He grins and flips off the kitchen light.
I walk to the living room to power off
the TV. Warren and Bridgette should
come home sometime in the next hour, so
I leave the lamp on in the living room.
Ridge: Will it be weird for you?
Me: Being drunk? Nope. I’m pretty
good at it.
Ridge: No. I mean Maggie.
I look up at him where he’s standing
in front of his bedroom door, watching
his phone, not making eye contact with
me. He looks nervous that he even asked
the question.
Me: Don’t worry about me, Ridge.
Ridge: Can’t help it. I feel like I’ve put
you in an awkward situation.
Me: You haven’t. I mean, don’t get me
wrong, it would help if you weren’t so
attractive, but I’m hoping Brennan
looks a lot like you. That way, when
you’re shacking up with Maggie
tomorrow night, I can have drunk, wild
fun with your little brother.
I hit send, then immediately gasp.
What the hell was I thinking? That
wasn’t funny. It was supposed to be
funny, but it’s after midnight, and I’m
never funny after midnight.
Shit.
Ridge is still looking down at the
screen on his phone. His jaw twitches,
and he shakes his head slightly, then
looks up at me as if I’ve just shot him
through the heart. He drops his arm and
runs his free hand through his hair, then
turns to walk to his room.
I. Suck.
I rush to him and put my hand on his
shoulder, urging him to turn back around.
He rolls his shoulder to brush my hand
off but pauses, only partially turning to
face me with a guarded expression. I
step around to his front so he’s forced to
look at me.
“I was kidding,” I say, slowly and
very seriously. “I’m sorry.”
His face is still tense and hard and
even a little disappointed, but he lifts his
phone and begins texting again.
Ridge: And therein lies the problem,
Sydney. You should be able to screw
whoever you want to screw, and I
shouldn’t give a shit.
I suck in a breath. At first, it pisses me
off, but then I focus in on the one word
that reveals the entire truth behind his
statement.
Shouldn’t.
He didn’t say, “I don’t give a shit.”
He said, “I shouldn’t give a shit.”
I look up at him, and his face is so full
of pain it’s heart-breaking.
He doesn’t want to feel like this. I
don’t want him to feel like this.
What the hell am I doing to him?
He runs both of his hands through his
hair, looks up at the ceiling, and
squeezes his eyes shut. He stands like
this for a while, then exhales and drops
his hands to his hips, lowering his eyes
to the floor.
He feels so guilty he can’t even look
at me.
Without making eye contact, he lifts an
arm and grabs my wrist, then pulls me
toward him. He crushes me to his chest,
wraps one arm around my back, and
curves his other hand against the back of
my head. My arms are folded up and
tucked between us while his cheek rests
against the top of my head. He sighs
heavily.
I don’t pull away from him in order to
text him a flaw, because I don’t think
he’s in need of one right now. The way
he’s holding me is different, unlike all
the times in the past few weeks when
we’ve had to separate ourselves in order
to breathe.
He’s holding me now as if I’m a part
of him—a wounded extension of his
heart—and he’s realizing just how much
that extension needs to be severed.
We stand like this for several minutes,
and I begin to get lost in the way he’s
wrapped himself around me. The way
he’s holding me gives me a glimpse of
what things could be like between us. I
try to push those two little words into the
back of my head, the two words that
always inch their way forward when
we’re together.
Maybe someday.
The sound of keys hitting a counter
behind me jerks me to attention. I pull
back, and Ridge does the same as soon
as he feels my body flinch against his.
He looks over my shoulder and toward
the kitchen, so I spin around. Warren has
just walked through the front door. His
back is toward us, and he’s slipping off
his shoes.
“I’m only going to say this once, and I
need you to listen,” Warren says. He
still isn’t facing us, but I’m the only one
in the apartment who can hear him, so I
know he’s directing his comment to me.
“He will never leave her, Sydney.”
He walks to his bedroom without
once looking over his shoulder, leaving
Ridge to believe he never even saw us.
The door to Warren’s bedroom closes,
and I turn back to face Ridge. His eyes
are still on Warren’s door. When they
flick back to mine, they’re full of so
many things I know he wishes he could
say. But he doesn’t. He just turns and
walks into his room, closing the door
behind him.
I remain completely motionless as
two huge tears spill from my eyes,
scarring their way down my cheeks in a
trail of shame.
Ridge
Brennan: Gotta love rain. Looks like I’ll
be there early. I’m coming alone,
though. The guys can’t make it.
Me: See you when you get here. Oh,
and before you leave tomorrow, make
sure you get all your shit out of
Sydney’s room.
Brennan: Will she be there? Do I
finally get to meet the girl who was
brought to this earth for us?
Me: Yeah, she’ll be here.
Brennan: I can’t believe I’ve never
asked this, but is she hot?
Oh, no.
Me: Don’t even think about it. She’s
been through too much shit to be
added to your list of concubines.
Brennan: Territorial, are we?
I toss my phone onto the bed and don’t
even bother with a reply. If I make her
too off-limits to him, it’ll just make him
try that much harder with her.
When she made the joke last night
about screwing him, she was just trying
to add humor to the seriousness of the
situation, but the way her text made me
feel terrified me.
It wasn’t the fact that she texted about
hooking up with someone. What terrified
me was my knee-jerk reaction. I wanted
to throw my phone against the wall and
smash it into a million pieces, then
throw her against the wall and show her
all the ways I could ensure that she
never thinks about another man again.
I didn’t like feeling that way. I
probably should encourage Brennan.
Maybe it would be better for my
relationship with Maggie if Sydney
actually started dating someone else.
Whoa.
The wave of jealousy that just rolled
over me felt more like a tsunami.
I walk out of my bedroom and head to
the kitchen to help Sydney get things
together for dinner before everyone gets
here. I pause when I see her bent over,
rummaging through the contents of the
refrigerator. She’s wearing the blue
dress again.
I hate it when Warren is right. My
eyes slowly scroll from the dress, down
her tanned legs, and back up again. I
exhale and contemplate asking her to go
change. I’m not sure I can deal with this
tonight. Especially when Maggie gets
here.
Sydney straightens up, pulls away
from the refrigerator, and turns toward
the counter. I notice she’s talking, but
she isn’t talking to me. She pulls a bowl
out of the refrigerator, and her mouth is
still moving, so naturally, my eyes scan
the rest of the apartment to see who it is
she’s talking to.
And that’s when both halves of my
heart—which were somehow still
connected by a small, invisible fiber—
snap apart and separate completely.
Maggie is standing in front of the
bathroom door, eyeing me hard. I can’t
read her expression, because it’s not one
I’ve ever been exposed to before. The
half of my heart that belongs to her
immediately begins to panic.
Look innocent, Ridge. Look innocent.
All you did was look at her.
I smile. “There’s my girl,” I sign as I
walk to her. The fact that I’m somehow
able to hide my guilt seems to ease her
concern. She smiles back and wraps her
arms around my neck when I reach her. I
slip my arms around her waist and kiss
her for the first time in two weeks.
God, I’ve missed her. She feels so
good. So familiar.
She smells good, she tastes good, she
is good. I’ve missed her so damn much. I
kiss her cheek and her chin and her
forehead, and I love that I’m so relieved
to have her here. For the past few days, I
began to fear that I wouldn’t have this
reaction the next time I saw her.
“I have to go really bad. Long drive.”
She winces and points to the door
behind her, and I give her another quick
kiss. Once she’s inside the bathroom, I
slowly turn back around to gauge
Sydney’s reaction.
I’ve been as upfront and honest with
Sydney as I can possibly be about my
feelings for Maggie, but I know it’s not
easy for her to see me with Maggie.
There’s just no way around it. Do I
compromise my relationship with
Maggie to spare Sydney’s feelings? Or
do I compromise Sydney’s feelings to
spare my relationship with Maggie?
Unfortunately, there’s no middle ground.
No right choice. My actions are
becoming split directly down the
middle, just like my heart.
I face her, and our eyes meet briefly.
She refocuses her attention down to the
cake in front of her and inserts candles.
When she finishes, she smiles and looks
back up at me. She sees the concern in
my expression, so she pats her chest and
makes the “okay” sign with her hand.
She’s reassuring me that she’s fine. I
practically have to pry myself away
from her every night, and then I maul my
girlfriend right in front of her—and she’s
reassuring me?
Her patience and understanding with
this whole screwed-up situation should
make me happy, but they have the
opposite effect. They disappoint me,
because they make me like her that much
more.
I can’t win for losing.
• • •
Oddly enough, Maggie and Sydney seem
to be having fun together in the kitchen,
prepping ingredients for a pot of chili. I
couldn’t hang, so I retreated to my room
and claimed I had a lot of work to catch
up on. As good as Sydney is with this,
I’m not as skilled. It was awkward for
me every time Maggie would kiss me or
sit on my lap or trail her fingers
seductively up my chest. Which, come to
think of it, was a bit odd. She’s never
really all that touchy-feely when we’re
hanging out, so she’s either feeling a tad
bit territorial, or she and Sydney have
already been hitting the Pine-Sol.
Maggie comes into the bedroom just
as I’m shutting the laptop. She kneels
down on the edge of the bed, leans
forward, and inches her way toward me.
She’s looking up at me with a flirtatious
smile, so I set the laptop aside and smile
back at her.
She crawls her way up my body until
she’s face-to-face with me, and then she
sits back on her heels, straddling me.
She cocks an eyebrow and tilts her head.
“You were checking out her ass.”
Shit.
I was hoping that moment had come
and gone.
I laugh and cup my hands around
Maggie’s backside and scoot her a little
closer. I let go and bring my hands back
around in front of her and answer her. “I
walked out of my room to a rear end
pointed toward my bedroom door. I’m a
guy. Guys notice things like that,
unfortunately.” I kiss her mouth, then pull
back.
She’s not smiling. “She’s really nice,”
Maggie signs. “And pretty. And funny.
And talented. And . . .”
The insecurity in her words makes me
feel like a jerk, so I grab her hands and
still them. “She’s not you,” I tell her.
“No one can ever be you, Maggie.
Ever.”
She smiles halfheartedly and places
her palms on the sides of my face and
slowly runs them down to my neck. She
leans forward and presses her mouth to
mine with so much force I can feel the
fear rolling off of her.
Fear that I put there.
I grab her face and kiss her with
everything I have, doing all I can to
erase her worries. The last thing this girl
needs is something else to stress her out.
When she breaks apart from me, her
features are still full of every single
negative emotion I’ve spent the past five
years helping her drown out.
“Ridge?” She pauses, then drops her
eyes while she blows out a long,
controlled breath. The nervousness in
her demeanor twists around my heart and
squeezes it. She brings her eyes
carefully back to mine. “Did you tell her
about me? Does she know?” Her eyes
search mine for an answer to the
question she should never even feel the
need to ask.
Does she not know me by now?
“No. God, no, Maggie. Why would I
do that? That’s always been your story
to tell, not mine. I would never do that.”
Her eyes fill with tears, and she tries
to blink them away. I let my head fall
back against the headboard. This girl
still has no idea how far I’ll go for her.
I lift my head away from the
headboard and look her hard in the eyes.
“To the ends of the earth, Maggie,” I
sign, repeating our phrase to her.
She forces a sad smile. “And back.”
Chapter Sixteen
Sydney
Someone is removing my clothes. Who
in the hell is removing my clothes?
I begin slapping away the hand that’s
pulling my shorts down past my knees. I
try to remember where I am, why I’m
here, and how I got here.
Party.
Cake.
Pine-Sol.
Spilling Pine-Sol on my dress.
Changing.
Drinking more Pine-Sol.
Lots of Pine-Sol.
Watching Ridge love Maggie.
God, he loves her so much. I saw it in
the way he watches her from across the
room. I saw it in the way he touches her.
In the way he communicates with her.
I can still smell the alcohol. I can still
taste it as I slide my tongue over my lips.
I danced . . .
I drank more Pine-Sol . . .
Oh! The drinking game. I invented my
own solitary drinking game, where every
time I saw how much Ridge loved
Maggie, I downed a shot. Unfortunately,
that made for a hell of a lot of shots.
Who in the hell is pulling off my
shorts?
I try to open my eyes, but I can’t tell if
it’s working. They feel open, but it’s
still dark inside my head.
Oh, my God. I’m drunk, and someone
is undressing me.
I’m about to be raped!
I start kicking at the hands that are
yanking the shorts from my feet.
“Sydney!” a girl yells. “Stop!” She’s
laughing. I focus for a few seconds and
can tell the voice belongs to Maggie.
“Maggie?”
She comes closer, and a soft hand
brushes back my hair as the bed dips
down next to me. I squeeze my eyes shut,
then force them wide open several times,
until I finally begin to adjust to the dark.
She puts her hands on my shirt and
attempts to unbutton it.
Why in the hell is she still taking off
my clothes?
Oh, my God! Maggie wants to rape
me!
I slap at her hand, and she grips my
wrist. “Sydney!” She laughs. “You’re
covered in puke. I’m trying to help you.”
Puke? Covered in it?
That explains the massive headache.
But . . . it doesn’t explain why I’m
laughing. Why am I laughing? Am I still
drunk? “What time is it?” I ask her.
“I don’t know. Tonight, I think. Like,
midnight?”
“That’s it?”
She nods, then starts laughing with
me. “You threw up on Brennan.”
Brennan? I met Brennan?
It looks as if her eyes are trying hard
to focus on my face. “Can I tell you a
secret?” she says.
I nod. “Okay, but I probably won’t
remember it, because I think I’m still
drunk.”
She smiles and leans forward. She’s
so pretty. Maggie is really, really pretty.
“I can’t stand Bridgette,” she says
quietly.
I laugh.
Maggie starts laughing again, too, and
tries to pull my shirt off, but she’s
laughing too hard and keeps having to
pause for deep breaths.
“Are you drunk, too?” I ask her.
She inhales again, attempting to pause
her laughter, and then she exhales. “So
drunk. I thought I took your shirt off
already, but your shirt keeps coming
back on, and I don’t know how many
shirts you have, but”—she lifts the edge
of my shirt sleeve, which is still on my
arm, and looks at it in confusion—“oh,
my God, I really thought I took it off
already, and here it is again.”
I lift myself up on the bed, then help
her pull my shirt off. “Why am I already
in bed if it’s only midnight?”
She shrugs. “I have no idea what you
just said.”
She’s funny. I reach to the nightstand
and turn on the lamp. Maggie scoots off
the bed and lowers herself to the floor.
She lies flat on her stomach with a sigh
and begins moving her arms, making
snow angels against the carpet.
“I don’t want to go to bed yet,” I tell
her. She flips over onto her back and looks
up at me. “Then don’t. I told Ridge to let
you stay up and play because we were
having so much fun, but you threw up in
Brennan’s lap, so he made you go to
bed.” She sits up. “Let’s go play some
more. I want more cake.” She pushes up
on her hands and stands, then reaches for
my hands and pulls me off the bed.
I look down at myself. “But you took
off my clothes,” I say, pouting.
She looks at my bra and underwear.
“Where’d you get that bra? It’s so cute.”
“JCPenney.”
“Oh. Ridge likes the kind that clasp in
the front, but yours is really cute. I want
one.”
“You should get one,” I say, smiling.
“We could be bra twins.”
She pulls me toward the door. “Let’s
go see if Ridge likes it. I want him to
buy me one.”
I smile. I hope he likes it. “Okay.”
Maggie opens the door to my room
and pulls me behind her into the living
room. “Ridge!” she yells. I laugh,
because I don’t know why she’s yelling
for him. He can’t hear her.
“Hey, Warren,” I say, grinning when I
see him on the couch. “Happy Birthday.”
Bridgette is seated next to him, glaring at
me. She’s looking me up and down,
probably jealous because my bra really
is cute.
Warren shakes his head and laughs.
“That’s only the fiftieth time you’ve said
that tonight, although it’s a little more
fitting now that you’re practically in
your birthday suit.”
Ridge is sitting on the other side of
Bridgette. He’s shaking his head like
Warren. “Maggie wants to know if you
like my bra,” I say to Ridge. I pull on
Maggie’s hand so she’ll turn around and
sign to him.
“It’s a very nice bra,” Ridge says,
staring at it with a cocked eyebrow.
I smile. Then I frown.
Did he just . . .? I yank my hand out of
Maggie’s and turn back toward Ridge.
“Did you just speak?”
He laughs. “Did you not just ask me a
question?”
I glare at him hard, especially when
Warren bursts out into a fit of laughter.
Oh.
My.
God.
He’s not deaf?
This whole time, he’s been lying to
me? It’s been a prank?
I instantly want to strangle him. Both
of them. Tears sting at my eyes, and the
second I lunge forward, a strong hand
grips my wrist and yanks my arm back. I
turn and look up at . . . Ridge?
I turn back to the couch and look at . .
. Ridge?
Warren is doubled over Bridgette’s
lap now, he’s laughing so hard. Ridge
Number 1 is laughing now, too. His
whole face doesn’t laugh when he
laughs, like Ridge Number 2’s face
does.
And his hair is shorter than Ridge
Number 2’s hair. And darker.
Ridge Number 2 has his arm wrapped
around my waist, and he’s picking me
up.
Now I’m upside down.
Not good for my stomach.
My face is toward his back, and my
stomach is slumped over his shoulder as
he carries me back toward my bedroom.
I look at Warren and the guy I now
realize is Brennan, and then I squeeze
my eyes shut, because I think I’m about
to throw up all over Ridge Number 2.
I’m being seated on something cold. A
floor.
As soon as my mind comprehends
where he’s put me, my hands reach
forward until I grasp the toilet, and then
it suddenly feels as if I’ve eaten Italian
food all over again. He holds my hair
back while the toilet fills with Pine-Sol.
I wish it really were Pine-Sol. I
wouldn’t have to clean it.
“Don’t you love her bra?” Maggie
says from behind me, giggling. “I know
it’s a back clasp, but look at how cute
the straps are!”
I feel a hand on one of my bra straps. I
can feel Ridge pull her hand away. His
arm moves, and I know he’s signing
something.
Maggie huffs. “I don’t want to go to
bed yet.”
He signs something else, and then she
sighs and walks into his bedroom.
When I’m finished, Ridge wipes my
face with a rag. I allow my back to fall
against the wall of the tub, and I look up
at him.
He doesn’t look very happy. In fact,
he looks a little angry.
“It’s a party, Ridge,” I mumble, and
close my eyes again.
His hands are under my arms, and I’m
being carried again. He makes his way
into . . . his room? He lowers me onto
his bed, and I roll over and open my
eyes. Maggie is grinning at me from the
pillow next to me.
“Yay. A sleepover,” she says with a
groggy smile. She grabs my hand and
holds it.
“Yay,” I say, smiling.
Covers are pulled over both of us, and
I close my eyes.
Ridge
“How did you get yourself into this
mess?”
Warren and I are both standing at the
edge of my bed, staring down at Maggie
and Sydney. They’re asleep. Sydney is
spooning Maggie on the left side of the
bed, because the right side of the bed is
now covered in Maggie’s puke.
I sigh. “This has been the longest
twelve hours of my life.”
Warren nods, then pats me heavily on
the back. “Well,” he signs, “I wish I
could stay and help you nurse them back
to health, but I’d rather pretend I have
something better to do and leave.” He
turns and walks out of my room as
Brennan makes his way in.
“I’m headed out,” he signs. “Got my
stuff out of Sydney’s room.”
I nod and watch as his eyes fall on
Sydney and Maggie.
“I wish I could say it was fun getting
to know Sydney, but I have a feeling I
didn’t even meet the real Sydney.”
I laugh. “Believe me, you didn’t.
Maybe next time.”
He waves and walks out of my
bedroom.
I turn and look at them, at both halves
of my heart, cuddled tightly together in a
bed of irony.
• • •
I spent the entire morning assisting them
as they alternated between the trash can
and the bathroom. By lunch, Sydney’s
vomiting had subsided, and she made her
way back to her own room. It’s late
afternoon now, and I’m spoon-feeding
Maggie liquids and forcing her to down
medicine.
“I just need sleep,” she signs. “I’ll be
fine.” She rolls over and pulls the
covers up to her chin.
I tuck a lock of hair behind her ear,
then run my hand down to her shoulder,
where I trace circles with my thumb. Her
eyes are now closed, and she’s curled
up in a fetal position. She looks so
fragile right now, and I wish I could
wrap myself around her like a cocoon
and shield her from every single thing
this world has left to throw at her.
I look over at the nightstand when the
screen on my phone lights up. I tuck the
covers more securely around Maggie
and bend forward and kiss her cheek,
then reach for my phone.
Sydney: Not that you haven’t done
enough, but could you please tell
Warren to turn the volume down on the
porn?
I laugh and text Warren.
Me: Turn the porn down. It’s so loud
even I can hear it.
I stand and walk into Sydney’s room
to check on her. She’s flat on her back,
staring up at the ceiling. I sit on the edge
of her bed, reach to her face, and brush
back a strand of hair from her forehead.
She tilts her face toward me and
smiles, then picks up her phone. Her
body is so weak she makes it look as if
the phone weighs fifty pounds when she
tries to text me.
I take the phone from her and shake
my head, letting her know she just needs
to rest. I set the phone on her nightstand
and bring my attention back to her. Her
head is relaxed against the pillow. Her
hair is in waves, trailing down her
shoulders. I run my fingers over a
section of her sun-kissed hair, admiring
how soft it is. She tilts her face toward
my hand until her cheek is resting flush
against it. I brush across her cheekbone
with my thumb and watch as her eyes
fall closed. The lyrics I wrote about her
flash through my mind: Lines are drawn,
but then they fade. For her I bend, for
you I break.
What kind of man does that make me?
If I can’t prevent myself from falling for
another girl, do I even deserve Maggie?
I refuse to answer that, because I know
that if I don’t deserve Maggie, I also
don’t deserve Sydney. The thought of
losing either of them, much less both of
them, is something I can’t bring myself to
entertain. I lift my hand and trace the
edge of Sydney’s face with my
fingertips, running them across her
hairline, down her jaw, and up her chin,
until my fingers reach her lips. I slowly
trace the shape of her mouth, feeling the
warm waves of breath pass her lips each
time I circle around them. She opens her
eyes, and the familiar pool of pain floats
behind them.
She lifts a hand to my fingers. She
pulls them firmly to her mouth and kisses
them, then pulls our hands away,
bringing them to rest on her stomach.
I’m looking at our hands now. She
opens a flat palm, and I do the same, and
we press them together.
I don’t know a lot about the human
body, but I would be willing to bet
there’s a nerve that runs directly from
the palm of the hand, straight to the heart.
Our fingers are outstretched until she
laces them together, squeezing gently
when our hands connect completely,
weaving together.
It’s the first time I’ve ever held her
hand.
We stare at our hands for what feels
like an eternity. Every feeling and every
nerve are centered in our palms, in our
fingers, in our thumbs, occasionally
brushing back and forth over one
another.
Our hands mold together perfectly,
just like the two of us.
Sydney and me.
I’m convinced that people come
across others in life whose souls are
completely compatible with their own.
Some refer to them as soul mates. Some
refer to it as true love. Some people
believe their souls are compatible with
more than one person, and I’m beginning
to understand how true that might be.
I’ve known since the moment I met
Maggie years ago that our souls were
compatible, and they are. That’s not
even a question.
However, I also know that my soul is
compatible with Sydney’s, but it’s also
so much more than that. Our souls aren’t
just compatible—they’re perfectly
attuned. I feel everything she feels. I
understand things she never even has to
say. I know that what she needs is
exactly what I could give her, and what
she’s wishing she could give me is
something I never even knew I needed.
She understands me. She respects me.
She astounds me. She predicts me. She’s
never once, since the second I met her,
made me feel as if my inability to hear is
even an inability at all.
I can also tell just by looking at her
that she’s falling in love with me. It
serves as further proof that I need to do
what should have been done a long time
ago.
I very reluctantly lean forward, reach
over to her nightstand, and grab a pen. I
pull my fingers from hers and open her
palm to write on it: I need you to move
out.
I close her fingers over her palm so
she doesn’t read it while I’m watching
her, and I walk away, leaving behind an
entire half of my heart as I go.
Chapter Seventeen
Sydney
I watch as he closes the door behind
him. I’m clutching my hand to my chest,
terrified to read what he wrote.
I saw the look in his eyes.
I saw the heartache, the regret, the
fear . . . the love.
I keep my hand clutched tightly to my
chest without reading it. I refuse to
accept that whatever words are written
on my palm will obliterate what little
hope I had for our maybe someday.
• • •
My body flinches, and my eyes flick
open.
I don’t know what just woke me up,
but I was in the middle of a dead sleep.
It’s dark. I sit up on the bed and press
my hand to my forehead, wincing from
the pain. I don’t feel nauseated anymore,
but I’ve never in my life been this
thirsty. I need water.
I stand up and stretch my arms above
my head, then glance down to the alarm
clock: 2:45 A.M.
Thank God. I could still use about
three more days of sleep to recover from
this hangover.
I’m walking toward Ridge’s bathroom
when an unfamiliar feeling washes over
me. I pause before reaching the door.
I’m not sure why I pause, but I suddenly
feel out of place.
It feels strange, walking toward this
bathroom right now. It doesn’t feel as if
I’m walking toward my bathroom. It
doesn’t feel as if it belongs to me at all,
unlike how my bathroom felt in my last
apartment. That bathroom felt like my
bathroom. As if it belonged partly to me.
That apartment felt like my apartment.
All the furniture in it felt like my
furniture.
Nothing about this place feels like me.
Other than the belongings that were
contained in the two suitcases I brought
with me that first night, nothing else here
feels even remotely like mine.
The dresser? Borrowed.
The bed? Borrowed.
Thursday-night TV? Borrowed.
The kitchen, the living room, my
entire bedroom. They all belong to other
people. I feel as if I’m just borrowing
this life until I find a better one of my
own. I’ve felt as if I’ve been borrowing
everything since the day I moved in here.
Hell, I’m even borrowing boyfriends.
Ridge isn’t mine. He’ll never be mine.
As much as that hurts to accept, I’m so
sick of this constant, ongoing battle with
my heart. I can’t take this anymore. I
don’t deserve this kind of self-torture.
In fact, I think I need to move out.
I do.
Moving out is the only thing that can
start the healing, because I can’t be
around Ridge anymore. Not with what
his presence does to me.
You hear that, heart? We’re even
now.
I smile at the realization that I’m
finally about to experience life on my
own. I’m consumed with a sense of
accomplishment. I open the bathroom
door and flip on the light . . . then
immediately fall to my knees.
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no!
I grab her by the shoulders and turn
her over, but her whole body is limp.
Her eyes are rolled back in her head,
and her face is pale.
Oh, my God! “Ridge!” I crawl over
her and reach for the door to his
bedroom. I’m screaming his name so
loudly my throat feels as if it’s ripping
apart. I attempt to turn the door-knob
several times, but my hand keeps
slipping.
She begins to convulse, so I lunge
over her and lift her head, then drop my
ear to her mouth to make sure she’s
breathing. I’m sobbing, screaming his
name over and over. I know he can’t
hear me, but I’m scared to let go of her
head.
“Maggie!” I cry.
What am I doing? I don’t know what
to do.
Do something, Sydney.
I lower her head carefully back to the
floor and spin around. I grip the
doorknob more firmly and pull myself to
my feet. I swing his bedroom door open
and rush toward the bed, then jump on it
and climb over to where he’s lying.
“Ridge!” I scream, shaking his
shoulder. He lifts an elbow in defense as
he rolls over, then lowers it when he
sees me hovering over him.
“Maggie!” I yell hysterically, pointing
to the bathroom. His eyes flash to the
empty spot on his bed, and his focus
shoots up to the open bathroom door.
He’s off the bed and on the bathroom
floor on his knees in seconds. Before I
even make it back to the bathroom, he’s
got her head cradled in his arms, and
he’s pulling her onto his lap.
He turns his head to look at me and
signs something. I shake my head as the
tears continue to flow down my cheeks. I
have no idea what he’s trying to say to
me. He signs again and points toward his
bed. I look at the bed, then look back at
him helplessly. His expression is
growing more frustrated by the second.
“Ridge, I don’t know what you’re
asking me!”
He slams his fist against the bathroom
cabinet out of frustration, then holds his
hand up to his ear as if he’s holding a
phone.
He needs his phone.
I rush to the bed and search for it, my
hands flying frantically over the bed, the
covers, the nightstand. I finally find it
under his pillow and run it back to him.
He enters his password to unlock it, then
hands it back to me. I dial 911, put the
phone to my ear, and wait for it to ring
while I drop to my knees next to them.
His eyes are full of fear as he
continues to hold her head against his
chest. He’s watching me, nervously
waiting for the call to connect. He
intermittently presses his lips into her
hair as he continues to try to get her to
open her eyes.
As soon as the operator answers, I’m
bombarded with a list of questions that I
don’t know the answers to. I give her the
address, because it’s the only thing I
know, and she begins firing more
questions I don’t know how to
communicate to him.
“Is she allergic to anything?” I say to
Ridge, repeating what the operator is
asking.
He shrugs and shakes his head, not
understanding me.
“Does she have any preexisting
conditions?”
He shakes his head again to tell me he
has no idea what I’m asking him.
“Is she diabetic?”
I ask Ridge the questions over and
over, but he can’t understand me. The
operator is firing questions at me, and
I’m firing them at Ridge, and we’re both
too frantic for him even to read my lips.
I’m crying. We’re both terrified. We’re
both frustrated with the fact that we can’t
communicate.
“Is she wearing a medical bracelet?”
the operator asks.
I lift both of her wrists. “No, she
doesn’t have anything on her.”
I look up to the ceiling and close my
eyes, knowing that I’m not helping a
damn bit.
“Warren!” I yell.
I’m off my feet and out of the
bathroom, making my way to Warren’s
bedroom. I swing open his door.
“Warren!” I run to his bed and shake him
while I hold the phone in my hand.
“Warren! We need your help! It’s
Maggie!”
His eyes open wide, and he throws off
his covers, springing into action. I push
the phone toward him. “It’s 911, and I
can’t understand anything Ridge is trying
to tell me!”
He grabs the phone and puts it to his
ear. “She has CFRD,” he yells hastily
into the phone. “Stage two CF.”
CFRD?
I follow him to the bathroom and
watch as he signs to Ridge while holding
the phone in the palm of his hand, away
from his ear. Ridge signs something
back, and Warren runs into the kitchen.
He opens the refrigerator, reaches
toward the back of the second shelf, and
pulls out a bag. He runs with it to the
bathroom and drops to his knees next to
Ridge. He lets the phone fall to the floor
and shoves it aside with his knee.
“Warren, she has questions!” I yell,
confused about why he tossed the phone
aside.
“We know what to do until they get
here, Syd,” he says. He pulls a syringe
from the bag and hands it to Ridge.
Ridge pulls the lid off of it and injects
Maggie in the stomach.
“Is she diabetic?” I ask, watching
helplessly as Warren and Ridge silently
converse. I’m ignored, but I don’t expect
anything different. They’re in what looks
like familiar territory for both of them,
and I’m too confused to keep watching. I
turn around and lean against the wall,
then squeeze my eyes shut in an attempt
to calm myself. A few silent moments
pass, and then there’s banging at the
door.
Warren is running toward the door
before I can even react. He lets the
paramedics inside, and I step out of the
way, watching as everyone in the room
around me seems to know what the hell
is going on.
I continue to back out of everyone’s
way until my calves meet the couch, and
I fall down onto it.
They lift Maggie onto the gurney and
begin pushing her toward the front door.
Ridge walks swiftly behind them.
Warren comes from Ridge’s bedroom
and tosses him a pair of shoes. Ridge
puts them on, then signs something else
to Warren and slips out the door behind
the gurney.
I watch as Warren rushes to his room.
He reemerges with a shirt and shoes on
and his baseball cap in hand. He grabs
his keys off the bar and heads back into
Ridge’s bedroom. He comes back out
with a bag of Ridge’s things and heads
for the front door.
“Wait!” I yell. Warren turns to look at
me. “His phone. He’ll need his phone.” I
rush to the bathroom, grab Ridge’s
phone from the floor, and take it back to
Warren.
“I’m coming with you,” I say, slipping
my foot into a shoe by the front door.
“No, you’re not.”
I look up at him, somewhat in shock at
the harshness of his voice as I slip my
other shoe on. He begins to pull the door
shut on me, and I slap a palm against it.
“I’m coming with you!” I say again,
more determined this time.
He turns and looks at me with
hardened eyes. “He doesn’t need you
there, Sydney.”
I have no idea what he means by that,
but his tone pisses me off. I push against
his chest and step outside with him. “I’m
coming,” I say with finality.
I walk down the stairs just as the
ambulance begins to pull away. Ridge is
standing with his hands clasped behind
his head, watching as it leaves. Warren
makes it to the bottom of the stairs, and
as soon as Ridge sees him, they both
rush toward Ridge’s car. I follow them.
Warren climbs into the driver’s seat,
Ridge into the passenger seat. I open the
door to the backseat and pull it shut
behind me.
Warren pulls out of the parking lot
and speeds until we’re caught up to the
ambulance.
Ridge is terrified. I can see it in the
way his arms are wrapped around
himself and he’s shaking his knee,
fidgeting with the sleeve of his shirt,
chewing on the corner of his bottom lip.
I still have no idea what’s wrong with
Maggie, and I’m scared that she might
not be okay. It still doesn’t feel like my
business, and I’m definitely not about to
ask Warren what’s going on.
The nervousness seeping from Ridge
is making my heart ache for him. I move
to the edge of the backseat and reach
forward, placing a comforting hand on
his shoulder. He lifts his hand to mine
and grabs it, then squeezes it tightly.
I want to help him, but I can’t. I don’t
know how. All I can think about is how
completely helpless I feel, how much
he’s hurting, and how scared I am that he
might lose Maggie, because it’s so
painfully obvious how that would kill
him. He brings his other hand up to mine,
which is still gripping his shoulder. He
squeezes both of his hands around mine
desperately, then tilts his face toward his
shoulder. He kisses the top of my hand,
and I feel a tear fall against my skin.
I close my eyes and press my forehead
against the back of his seat, and I cry.
• • •
We’re in the waiting room.
Well, Warren and I are in the waiting
room. Ridge has been with Maggie since
we arrived an hour ago, and Warren
hasn’t spoken a single word to me.
Which is why I’m not speaking to him.
He obviously has an issue, and I’m not
really in the mood to defend myself,
because I’ve done absolutely nothing to
Warren that should even require
defending.
I slouch back in my chair and pull up
the search browser on my phone, curious
to know about what Warren said to the
911 operator.
I type CFRD into the search box and
hit enter. My eyes are pulled to the very
first result: Managing cystic fibrosis–
related diabetes.
I click on the link, and it explains the
different types of diabetes but doesn’t
explain much more. I’ve heard of cystic
fibrosis but don’t know enough about it
to know how it affects Maggie. I click a
link on the left of the page that says,
What is cystic fibrosis? My heart begins
to pound and my tears are flowing as I
take in the same words that stick out on
every single page, no matter how many
pages I click.
Genetic disorder of the lungs.
Life-threatening.
Shortened life expectancy.
No known cure.
Survival rates into mid- and upper
thirties.
I can’t read any more through all the
tears I’m crying for Maggie. For Ridge.
I close the browser on my phone, and
my eyes are pulled to my hand. I take in
the unread words in Ridge’s handwriting
across my palm.
I need you to move out.
Ridge
Both Warren and Sydney spring to their
feet when I round the corner to the
waiting room.
“How is she?” Warren signs.
“Better. She’s awake now.”
Warren nods, and Sydney is looking
back and forth between us.
“The doctor says the alcohol and
dehydration probably caused her . . .” I
stop signing, because Warren’s lips are
pressed into a firm line as he watches
my explanation.
“Verbalize for her,” I sign, nodding
my head toward Sydney.
Warren turns and looks at Sydney,
then refocuses his attention on me. “This
doesn’t concern her,” he signs silently.
What the hell is his problem?
“She’s worried about Maggie,
Warren. It does concern her. Now,
verbalize what I’m saying for her.”
Warren shakes his head. “She’s not
here for Maggie, Ridge. She doesn’t
care how Maggie’s doing. She’s only
worried about you.”
I bury my anger, then slowly step
forward and stand directly in front of
him. “Verbalize for her. Now.”
Warren sighs but doesn’t turn toward
Sydney. He stares straight at me as he
both signs and verbalizes for us. “Ridge
says Maggie’s okay. She’s awake.”
Sydney’s entire body relaxes as her
hands go to the back of her head and
relief washes over her. She says
something to him, and he closes his eyes,
takes a quick breath, then opens them.
“Sydney wants to know if either of
you need anything. From the apartment.”
I look at Sydney and shake my head.
“They’re keeping her overnight to
monitor her blood sugar. I’ll come by
tomorrow if we need anything. I’m
staying a few days at her house.”
Warren verbalizes again, and Sydney
nods.
“You two head back and get some
rest.”
Warren nods. Sydney steps forward
and gives me a tight hug, then backs
away.
Warren begins to turn toward the exit,
but I grab his arm and make him look at
me again. “I don’t know why you’re
upset with her, Warren, but please don’t
be a jerk to her. I’ve done that enough
already.”
He nods, and they turn to leave.
Sydney looks back over her shoulder
and smiles a painful smile. I turn and
walk back to Maggie’s room.
The head of her bed is slightly raised
now, and she looks up at me. There’s an
IV drip in her arm, replenishing her
fluids. Her head slowly rolls across her
pillow as her eyes follow me across the
room.
“I’m sorry,” she signs.
I shake my head, not even remotely
wanting or needing any type of apology
from her. “Stop. Don’t feel bad. Like
you always say, you’re young. Young
people do crazy things like get drunk and
have hangovers and puke for twelve
hours straight.”
She laughs. “Yes, but like you always
say, probably not young people with
life-threatening conditions.”
I smile as I reach her bed, then scoot a
chair close to it and take a seat. “I’m
going back to San Antonio with you. I’ll
stay a few days until I feel better about
leaving you alone.”
She sighs and turns her head, looking
straight up to the ceiling. “I’m fine. It
was just an insulin issue.” She turns
back to face me. “You can’t baby me
every time this happens, Ridge.”
My jaw clenches at “baby me.” “I’m
not babying you, Maggie. I’m loving
you. I’m taking care of you. There’s a
difference.”
She closes her eyes and shakes her
head. “I’m so tired of having this same
conversation over and over.”
Yeah. So am I.
I lean back in my chair and fold my
arms over my chest while I stare at her.
Her refusal of help has been
understandable up to this point, but she’s
not a teenager anymore, and I can’t
understand why she won’t allow things
to progress with us.
I lean forward, touching her arm so
she’ll look at me and listen. “You need
to stop being so hell-bent and
determined to have your independence.
If you don’t take better care of yourself,
these brief one-night hospital stays will
be a thing of the past, Maggie. Let me
take care of you. Let me be there for you.
I constantly worry myself sick. Your
internship is causing you so much stress,
not to mention the thesis. I understand
why you want to live a normal life and
do all the things other people our age do,
like go to college and have a career.” I
pause to run my hands through my hair
and focus on the point I want to make. “If
we lived together, I could do so much
more for you. Things would be easier
for both of us. And when things like this
happen, I’ll be there to help you so you
don’t convulse alone on the bathroom
floor until you die!”
Breathe, Ridge.
Okay, that was harsh. Way too harsh.
I roll my neck and look down at the
floor, because I’m not ready for her to
respond yet. I close my eyes and try to
hold back my frustration. “Maggie,” I
sign, looking at her tear-soaked eyes. “I .
. . love . . . you. And I am so scared that
one of these days, I won’t be able to
walk out of the hospital with you still in
my arms. And it’ll be my own fault for
allowing you to continue to refuse my
help.”
Her bottom lip is quivering, so she
tucks it into her mouth and bites it.
“Sometime in the next ten or fifteen
years, Ridge, that will be your reality.
You are going to walk out of the hospital
without me, because no matter how much
you want to be my hero, I can’t be saved.
You can’t save me from this. We both
know you’re one of the few people I
have in this world, so until the day
comes when I can absolutely no longer
take care of myself, I refuse to become
your burden. Do you know what that
does to me? To know that I’ve put that
much pressure on you? I’m not living
alone simply because I crave
independence, Ridge. I want to live
alone because . . .”
Tears are streaming down her cheeks,
and she pauses to wipe them away. “I
want to live alone because I just want to
be the girl you’re in love with . . . for as
long as we can draw that out. I don’t
want to be your burden or your
responsibility or your obligation. The
only thing I want is to be the love of your
life. That’s all. Please, just let that be
enough for now. Let it be enough until
the time comes when you really do have
to go to the ends of the earth for me.”
A sob breaks free from my chest, and
I reach forward and press my lips to
hers. I grip her face desperately between
my hands and lift my leg onto the bed.
She wraps her arms around me as I pull
the rest of my body on top of hers and do
whatever I can to shield her from the
unfairness of this evil, goddamned
world.
Chapter Eighteen
Sydney
I close the door to Ridge’s car and
follow Warren up the stairs toward the
apartment. Neither of us said a word to
each other on the drive home from the
hospital. The rigidness in his jaw said
all he needed to say, which was, more or
less, Don’t speak to me. I spent the
drive with my focus out the window and
my questions lodged in my throat.
We walk into the apartment, and he
tosses his keys onto the bar as I shut the
door behind me. He doesn’t even turn
around to look at me as he stalks off
toward his bedroom.
“Good night,” I say. I might have said
it with a little bit of sarcastic bite, but at
least I’m not screaming, “Screw you,
Warren!” which is kind of what I feel
like saying.
He pauses, then turns around to face
me. I watch him nervously, because
whatever he’s about to say to me isn’t
“good night.” His eyes narrow as he tilts
his head, shaking it slowly. “Can I ask
you a question?” he finally says, eyeing
me with curiosity.
“As long as you promise never again
to begin a question by asking whether or
not you can propose a question.”
I want to laugh at my use of Ridge’s
comment, but Warren doesn’t even crack
a smile. It only makes things much more
awkward. I shift on my feet. “What’s
your question, Warren?” I say with a
sigh.
He folds his arms over his chest and
walks toward me. I swallow my
nervousness as he leans forward to
speak to me, barely a foot away. “Do
you just need someone to fuck you?”
Breathe in, breathe out.
Expand, contract.
Beat beat, pause. Beat beat, pause.
“What?” I say, dumbfounded. I’m
positive I didn’t hear him right.
He lowers his head a few inches until
he’s at eye level with me. “Do you just
need someone to fuck you?” he says,
with more precise enunciation this time.
“Because if that’s all it is, I’ll bend you
over the couch right now and fuck you so
hard you’ll never think about Ridge
again.” He continues to stare at me, cold
and heartless.
Think before you react, Sydney.
For several seconds, all I can do is
shake my head in disbelief. Why would
he say that? Why would he say
something so disrespectful to me? This
isn’t Warren. I don’t know who this
asshole is standing in front of me, but it
definitely isn’t Warren.
Before I allow myself time to think, I
react. I pull my arm back, then make four
punches my lifetime average as my fist
meets his cheek.
Shit.
That hurt.
I look up at him, and his hand is
covering his cheek. His eyes are wide,
and he’s looking at me with more
surprise than pain. He takes a step back,
and I keep my eyes focused hard on his.
I grab my fist and pull it up to my
chest, pissed that I’m going to have
another hurt hand. I wait before going to
the kitchen to get ice for it, though. I
might need to hit him again.
I’m confused by his obvious anger
toward me for the past twenty-four
hours. My mind rushes through anything I
could have said or done to him that
would make him feel this much hatred
toward me.
He sighs and tilts his head back,
pulling his hands through his hair. He
gives no explanation for his hateful
words, and I try to understand them, but I
can’t. I’ve done nothing to him to
warrant something that harsh.
Maybe that’s his problem, though.
Perhaps the fact that I’ve done nothing to
him—or with him—is what’s pissing
him off like this.
“Is this jealousy?” I ask. “Is that
what’s making you this evil, wretched
excuse for a human being? Because I
never slept with you?”
He takes a step forward, and I
immediately back up until I fall down
onto the couch. He bends down, bringing
himself to my eye level.
“I don’t want to screw you, Sydney.
And I am definitely not jealous.” He
pushes himself away from the couch.
Away from me.
He’s scaring the living shit out of me,
and I want to pack my suitcases and
leave tonight and never, ever see any of
these people again.
I begin crying into my hands. I hear
him sigh heavily, and he drops down
onto the couch beside me. I pull my feet
up and turn my knees away from him,
curling into the far corner of the couch.
We sit like this for several minutes, and
I want to stand up and run to my room,
but I don’t. I feel as if I’d have to ask
permission, because I don’t even know
if I have a room here anymore.
“I’m sorry,” he finally says, breaking
the silence with something other than my
crying. “God, I’m sorry. I just . . . I’m
trying to understand what the hell you’re
doing.”
I wipe my face with my shirt and
glance at him. His face is a jumbled
mixture of sadness and sorrow, and I
don’t understand anything he’s feeling.
“What is your problem with me,
Warren? I’ve never been anything but
nice to you. I’ve even been nice to your
bitch of a girlfriend, and believe me, that
takes effort.”
He nods in agreement. “I know,” he
says, exasperated. “I know, I know, I
know. You are a nice person.” He laces
his fingers together and stretches his
arms out, then brings them back down
with a heavy sigh. “And I know you have
good intentions. You have a good heart.
And a pretty good right swing,” he says,
grinning slyly. “I guess that’s why I’m so
mad, though. I know you have a good
heart, so why in the hell haven’t you
moved out yet?” His words hurt me
more now than the vulgar ones he spit at
me five minutes ago.
“If you and Ridge wanted me gone
this bad, why did you both wait until this
weekend to tell me?”
My question seems to catch Warren
off-guard, because his eyes cut to mine
briefly before he looks away again. He
doesn’t answer that question, though.
Instead, he begins to prepare one of his
own. “Has Ridge ever told you the story
of how he met Maggie?” he asks.
I shake my head, completely confused
by the direction this conversation has
taken.
“I was seventeen, and Ridge had just
turned eighteen,” he says. He leans back
against the couch and stares down at his
hands.
I recall Ridge saying he began dating
Maggie when he was nineteen, but I keep
silent and let him continue.
“We had been dating for about six
weeks, and . . .”
Scratch that thought. Can no longer
keep silent. “We?” I ask hesitantly. “As
in you and Ridge?”
“No, dumbass. As in me and
Maggie.”
I try to hide my shock, but he doesn’t
look at me long enough to even see my
reaction.
“Maggie was my girlfriend first. I met
her at a fund-raising event for children
who were deaf. I was there with my
parents, who were both on the
committee.” He pulls his hands behind
his head and leans against the couch.
“Ridge was with me the first time I
saw her. We both thought she was the
most beautiful thing we had ever laid
eyes on, but, fortunately for me, my eyes
landed on her about five seconds before
his did, so I called dibs. Of course,
neither one of us expected to actually
have a chance with her. I mean, you’ve
seen her. She’s incredible.” He pauses
for a moment, then props a leg on the
table in front of us.
“Anyway, I spent the whole day
flirting with her. Charming her with my
good looks and my killer body.”
I laugh, but only out of courtesy.
“She agreed to go on a date with me,
so I told her I’d pick her up that Friday
night. I took her out, made her laugh,
took her back home, and kissed her. It
was great, so I asked her out again, and
she agreed. I took her out for a second
date, then a third date. I liked her. We
got along well; she laughed at my jokes.
She also got along with Ridge, which
scored major points in my book. The girl
and the best friend have to get along, or
one of the two will suffer. Luckily, we
all got along great. On our fourth date, I
asked her if she wanted to make it
official, and she agreed. I was stoked,
because I knew she was by far the
hottest girl I’d ever dated or ever would
date. I couldn’t let her slip away,
especially before I was able to go all the
way with her.”
He laughs. “I remember saying that to
Ridge the same night. Told him if there
was one girl on this earth I needed to
devirginize, it was Maggie. Told him I’d
go on a hundred dates with her if that’s
what it took. He turned his head to me
and signed, ‘What about a hundred and
one?’ I laughed, because I didn’t
understand what the hell Ridge meant. I
didn’t understand at the time that he
liked her the way he did, and I never
really understood all the little gems he
would spout. Still don’t. Looking back
on the whole situation and the way he
would sit there and have to listen to the
punk-ass things I said about her, I’m
surprised he didn’t punch me sooner than
he did.”
“He punched you?” I ask. “Why?
Because you talked about screwing
her?”
He shakes his head, and a look of guilt
washes over him. “No,” he says quietly.
“Because I did screw her.”
He sighs but continues. “We were
staying the night at Ridge and Brennan’s.
Maggie spent a lot of time over there
with me, and we had been dating for
about six weeks. I know that’s not long
in virgin weeks, but it’s a damn eternity
in guy weeks. We were lying in bed
together, and she told me she was ready
to go all the way, but before she would
have sex with me, there was something
she needed to tell me. She said I had a
right to know, and she wouldn’t feel
right continuing a relationship until I was
fully informed. I remember panicking,
thinking she was about to tell me she
was a dude or some shit like that.”
He glances at me and raises an
eyebrow. “Because let’s be honest, Syd.
There are some really hot transvestitelooking
dudes out there.”
He laughs and looks straight ahead
again. “That’s when she told me about
her illness. Told me about the statistics .
. . the fact that she didn’t want children .
. . the reality of how much time she had
left. She said she wanted to lay the truth
out for me because it wouldn’t be fair to
anyone who saw something long-term
with her. She said the likelihood of her
making it to the age of forty or even
thirty-five was small. She said she
needed to be with someone who
understood that. Someone who accepted
that.”
“You didn’t want that responsibility?”
I ask him.
He shakes his head slowly. “Sydney, I
didn’t care about the responsibility. I
was a seventeen-year-old guy, in bed
with the most beautiful girl I had ever
seen, and all she was asking me to do
was agree to love her. When she
mentioned the words ‘future’ and
‘husband’ and not wanting kids, it took
all I had not to roll my eyes, because in
my head, those were a lifetime away. I
would be with a million girls before
then. I didn’t know how to think that far
ahead, so I just did what I thought any
guy would do in that situation. I
reassured her and told her that her
illness didn’t matter to me and that I
loved her. Then I kissed her, took off her
clothes, and took her virginity.”
He hangs his head in what looks like
shame. “After she left the next morning, I
was bragging to Ridge about finally
getting to bang a virgin. Probably went
into way too much detail. I also
mentioned the conversation we had
beforehand and told him all about her
illness. I was brutally honest with him to
a fault sometimes. I told him that her
whole situation kind of freaked me out
and that I was going to give it two weeks
before I broke up with her so I wouldn’t
look like such a douche. That’s when he
beat the living shit out of me.”
My eyes widen. “Good for Ridge,” I
say. Warren nods. “Yeah. Apparently, he
liked her a whole lot more than he let on,
but he just kept his mouth shut and
allowed me to make an ass of myself for
the whole six weeks I dated her. I should
have caught on about how he felt, but
Ridge is a lot more selfless than I am.
He would have never done anything to
betray what we had, but after that night,
he lost a whole lot of respect for me.
And that hurt, Sydney. He’s like my
brother. I felt like I had disappointed the
one person I looked up to the most.”
“So you broke up with Maggie, and
Ridge started dating her?”
“Yes and no. We had a long
conversation about it that afternoon,
because Ridge is big on sharing his
thoughts and shit. We agreed we had to
honor the bro code, and it wouldn’t
really be good for us if he picked up and
started dating a girl I had just screwed.
But he liked her. He liked her a lot, and
even though I knew it was hard for him,
he waited until the term ended before he
asked her out.”
“The term?”
Warren nods. “Yeah. Don’t ask where
we came up with it, but we agreed
twelve months was a decent length of
time before the bro code became null.
We figured enough time would have
passed, and if he wanted to ask her out
after a year, it wouldn’t be so weird. By
that time, she might have dated other
people and wouldn’t be going straight
from my bed into Ridge’s. As much as I
could have tried to be cool about it, it
would have been too weird. Even for
us.”
“Did Maggie know how he felt about
her? During the twelve months?”
Warren shakes his head. “No. Maggie
never even knew he liked her like he
did. He liked her so much he didn’t go
on a single date for the entire twelve
months I made him wait. He had the date
circled on a calendar. I saw it once in
his room. He never mentioned her, never
asked about her. But I’ll be damned if
the day that year was up, he wasn’t
knocking on her front door. And it took
her a while to come around, especially
knowing she would have to interact with
me. But things eventually worked
themselves out. She ended up with the
right guy in the end, thanks to Ridge’s
persistence.”
I exhale. “Wow,” I say. “Talk about
devotion.”
He turns his head toward mine, and
our eyes meet. “Exactly,” he says firmly,
as if I just summed up his whole point. “I
have never in my life met another human
being with more devotion than that man.
He’s the best damn thing that’s ever
happened to me. The best thing that’s
ever happened to Maggie.”
He pulls his feet up onto the couch
and faces me full-on. “He’s gone through
hell and back for that girl, Sydney. All
the hospital stays, driving back and forth
to take care of her, promising her the
world, and giving up so much of himself
in return. And she deserves it. She’s one
of the purest, most selfless people I’ve
ever met, and if there are two people
who deserve each other in this world,
it’s the two of them.
“So when I see how he looks at you, it
pains me. I saw the way the two of you
watched each other at the party the other
night. I saw the jealousy in his eyes
every time you spoke to Brennan. I’ve
never seen him struggle with his choice
or the sacrifices he’s made for Maggie
until you showed up. He’s falling in love
with you, Sydney, and I know you know
that. However, I also know his heart,
and he’ll never leave Maggie. He loves
her. He would never do that to her. So
seeing him torn apart because of the way
he feels about you and knowing his life
is with Maggie, I just don’t understand
why you’re still here. I don’t understand
why you’re putting him through that much
pain. Each day you’re still here and I see
him looking at you the same way he used
to look at Maggie, it makes me want to
shove you out the damn door and tell you
to never come back. And I know that’s
not your fault. I know that. Hell, you
didn’t even know the half of what he’s
going through until tonight. But now you
do. And as much as I love you and think
you’re one of the coolest damn chicks
I’ve ever met, I also never want to see
your face again. Especially now that you
know the truth about Maggie. And
forgive me if this is harsh, but I don’t
want you getting it into your head that the
love you have for Ridge will be enough
to hold you over until the day Maggie
dies. Because Maggie isn’t dying,
Sydney. Maggie’s living. She’ll be
around a lot longer than Ridge’s heart
could ever survive you.”
My head rolls forward into my hands
as the sobs erupt from my chest.
Warren’s arm folds over my back, and
he pulls me against him. I don’t know
who I’m crying for right now, but my
heart hurts so much I just want to rip it
from my fucking chest and throw it over
Ridge’s balcony, because that’s where
this whole mess began.
Ridge
Maggie has been asleep for a couple of
hours now, but I’ve yet to sleep. That’s
usually how it is when I’m with her in
the hospital. After five years of sporadic
stays, I’ve learned it’s much easier not
to sleep at all than it is to get a half-ass
couple of hours.
I open my laptop and pull up my
messages to Sydney, then send her a
quick hello to see if she’s online. We
haven’t had a chance to discuss the fact
that I asked her to move out, and I hate
not knowing if she’s okay. I know it’s
wrong to be messaging her at this point,
but it seems even more wrong to leave
things unsaid.
She returns my message almost
immediately, and the tone of it already
relieves some of my worry. I don’t know
why I always expect she’ll respond
unreasonably, because she’s never once
shown a lack of maturity or regard for
my situation.
Sydney: Yeah, I’m here. How’s
Maggie?
Me: She’s good. She’ll be discharged
this afternoon.
Sydney: That’s good. I’ve been
worried.
Me: Thank you, by the way. For your
help last night.
Sydney: I wasn’t much help. I felt like I
was in the way more than anything.
Me: You weren’t. There’s no telling
what could have happened if you
hadn’t found her.
I wait a moment for her to respond,
but she doesn’t. I guess we’ve reached
the point in this conversation where one
of us needs to bring up what we both
know must be discussed. I feel
responsible for this entire situation with
her, so I bite the bullet and lay it out
there.
Me: Do you have a minute? I really
have some things I’d like to say to you.
Sydney: Yes, and likewise.
I glance up at Maggie again, and she’s
still asleep in the same position. Having
this conversation with Sydney in her
presence, as innocent as it is, makes me
uneasy. I take my laptop and walk out of
the hospital room and into the empty
hallway. I sit on the floor beside the
door to Maggie’s room and reopen my
laptop.
Me: The main thing I’ve appreciated
about our time together over the last
couple of months is the fact that we’ve
been upfront and consistent with each
other. With that being said, I don’t
want you to leave with the wrong idea
about why I need you to move out. I
don’t want you to think you did
anything wrong.
Sydney: I don’t need an explanation.
I’ve more than worn out my welcome,
and you have enough to stress about
without adding me into the mix.
Warren found an apartment for me
this morning, but it isn’t available for a
few days. Is it okay if I stay here until
then?
Me: Of course. When I said I needed
you to move, I didn’t literally mean
today. I just meant soon. Before things
become too hard for me to continue to
walk away.
Sydney: I’m sorry, Ridge. I didn’t
mean for any of this to happen.
I know she’s referring to the way we
feel about each other. I know exactly
what she means, because I didn’t mean
for it to happen, either. In fact, I’ve done
everything I could to stop it from
happening, but somehow my heart never
got the message. If I know it wasn’t
intentional on my part, I know it wasn’t
intentional on her part, so she has
nothing to apologize for.
Me: Why are you apologizing? Don’t
apologize. It’s not your fault, Sydney.
Hell, I’m not even sure it’s MY fault.
Sydney: Well, usually when something
goes wrong, someone is at fault.
Me: Things didn’t go wrong with us.
That’s our problem. Things are way too
right between us. We make sense.
Everything about you feels so right,
but—
I pause for a few moments to gather
my thoughts, because I don’t want to say
anything I’ll regret. I inhale, then type
out the best way to describe how I feel
about our entire situation.
Me: There isn’t a doubt in my mind that
we could be perfect for each other’s
life, Sydney. It’s our lives that aren’t
perfect for us.
Several minutes pass without a
response. I don’t know if I crossed the
line with my comments, but however
she’s reacting to them, I needed to say
what I had to say before I could let her
go. I’m beginning to close my laptop
when another message pops up from her.
Sydney: If there’s one thing I’ve
learned from this whole experience, it’s
that my ability to trust wasn’t
completely broken by Hunter and Tori
like I initially thought. You’ve always
been upfront with me about how you
feel. We’ve never skirted around the
truth. If anything, we’ve worked
together to find a way to change our
course. I want to thank you for that.
Thank you so much for showing me
that guys like you actually exist, and
not everyone is a Hunter.
She somehow has a way of making me
sound so much more innocent than I
actually am. I’m not nearly as strong as
she thinks I am.
Me: Don’t thank me, Sydney. You
shouldn’t thank me, because I failed
miserably at trying not to fall in love
with you.
I swallow the lump forming in my
throat and hit send. Saying what I’ve just
said to her fills me with more guilt than
the night I kissed her. Words can
sometimes have a far greater effect on a
heart than a kiss.
Sydney: I failed first.
I read her last message, and the
finality of our imminent good-bye hits
me full-force. I feel it in every single
part of me, and I’m shocked at the
reaction I’m having to it. I lean my head
against the wall behind me and try to
imagine my world before Sydney
entered it. It was a good world. A
consistent world. But then she came
along and shook my world upside down
as if it were a fragile, breakable snow
globe. Now that she’s leaving, it feels as
if the snow is about to settle, and my
whole world will be upright and still
and consistent again. As much as that
should make me feel at ease, it actually
terrifies me. I’m scared to death that I’ll
never again feel any of the things I felt
during the little time she’s been in my
world.
Anyone who has made this much of an
impact deserves a proper good-bye.
I stand and walk back into Maggie’s
hospital room. She’s still asleep, so I
walk over to her bed, give her a light
kiss on the forehead, and leave her a
note explaining that I’m heading to the
apartment to pack a few things before
she’s released.
Then I leave to go and give the other
half of my heart a proper good-bye.
• • •
I’m outside Sydney’s bedroom door,
preparing to knock. We’ve said
everything that needs to be said and even
a lot that probably shouldn’t have been
said, but I can’t not see her one last time
before I go. She’ll be gone by the time I
get back from San Antonio. I have no
plans to contact her after today, so the
fact that I know this is definitely goodbye
is pressing on the walls of my chest,
and it fucking hurts like hell.
If I were to look at my situation from
an outsider’s point of view, I would be
telling myself to forget about Sydney’s
feelings, that my loyalty should lie solely
with Maggie. I would be telling myself
to leave and that Sydney doesn’t deserve
a good-bye, even after all we’ve been
through.
Is life really that black-and-white,
though? Can a simple right or wrong
define my situation? Do Sydney’s
feelings not count in this mix somewhere
despite my loyalty to Maggie? It doesn’t
seem right just to let her go. But it’s
unfair to Maggie not to just let her go.
I don’t know how I ever got myself
into this mess to begin with, but I know
the only way to end it is to break off all
contact with Sydney. I knew the moment
I held her hand last night that there
wasn’t a flaw in the world that could
have stopped my heart from feeling what
it was feeling.
I’m not proud of the fact that Maggie
doesn’t make up all of my heart
anymore. I fought it. I fought it hard,
because I didn’t want it to happen. Now
that the fight is finally coming to an end,
I’m not even sure if I’m winning or
losing. I’m not even sure which side I’m
rooting for, much less which side I was
on.
I knock lightly on Sydney’s door, then
place my palms flat against the
doorframe and look down, half of me
hoping she refuses to open it and half of
me restraining myself from breaking
down the damn door to get to her.
Within seconds, we’re face-to-face
for what I know is the last time. Her blue
eyes are wide with fear and surprise and
maybe even a small amount of relief
when she sees me standing in front of
her. She doesn’t know how to feel about
seeing me here, but her confusion is
comforting. It’s good to know I’m not
alone in this, that we’re both sharing the
same mixture of emotions. We’re in this
together.
Sydney and me.
We’re just two completely confused
souls, scared of a much unwanted yet
crucial good-bye.
Chapter Nineteen
Sydney
Be still, heart. Please, be still.
I don’t want him to be standing here in
front of me. I don’t want him to be
looking at me, wearing the expression
that mirrors my own feelings. I don’t
want him to hurt like I’m hurting. I don’t
want him to miss me like I’ll miss him. I
don’t want him to be falling for me like
I’ve been falling for him.
I want him to be with Maggie right
now. I want him to want to be with
Maggie right now, because it would
make this so much easier knowing our
feelings were less a reflection of each
other’s and more like a one-way mirror.
If this weren’t so hard for him, it would
make it easier for me to forget him,
easier to accept his choice. Instead, it
makes my heart hurt twice as much
knowing that our good-bye is hurting him
just as much as it’s hurting me.
It’s killing me, because nothing and
no one could ever fit my life the way I
know he could. I feel as though I’m
willingly forking over my one chance for
an exceptional life, and in return, I’m
accepting a mediocre version without
Ridge in it. My father’s words ring in my
head, and I’m beginning to wonder if he
had a point after all. A life of mediocrity
is a waste of a life.
Our eyes remain in their silent
embrace for several moments, until we
both break our gaze, allowing ourselves
to take in every last thing about each
other.
His eyes scroll carefully over my face
as if he’s committing me to memory. His
memory is the last place I want to be.
I would give anything to always be in
his present.
I lean my head against my open
bedroom door and stare at his hands still
gripping the doorframe. The same hands
I’ll never see play a guitar again. The
same hands that will never hold mine
again. The same hands that will never
again touch me and hold me in order to
listen to me sing.
The same hands that are suddenly
reaching for me, wrapping themselves
around me, gripping my back in an
embrace so tight I don’t know if I could
break away even if I tried. But I’m not
trying to break away. I’m reciprocating.
I’m hugging him with just as much
desperation. I find solace against his
chest while his cheek presses against the
top of my head. With each heavy,
uncontrolled breath that passes through
his lungs, my own breaths try to keep
pace. However, mine are coming in
much shorter gasps, thanks to the tears
that are working their way out of me.
My sadness is consuming me, and I
don’t even try to hold it in as I cry huge
tears of grief. I’m crying tears over the
death of something that never even had
the chance to live.
The death of us.
Ridge and I remain clasped together
for several minutes. So many minutes
that I’m trying not to count, for fear that
we’ve been standing here way too long
for it to be an appropriate embrace.
Apparently, he notices this, too, because
he slides his hands up my back and to my
shoulders, then pulls away from me. I lift
my face from his shirt and wipe at my
eyes before looking back up at him.
Once we make eye contact again, he
removes his hands from my shoulders
and tentatively places them on either
side of my face. His eyes study mine for
several moments, and the way he’s
looking at me makes me hate myself,
because I love it so much.
I love the way he’s looking at me as if
I’m the only thing that matters right now.
I’m the only one he sees. He’s the only
one I see. My thoughts once again lead
back to some of the lyrics he wrote.
It’s making me feel like I want to be
the only man that you ever see.
His gaze flickers between my mouth
and my eyes, almost as if he can’t decide
if he wants to kiss me, stare at me, or
talk to me.
“Sydney,” he whispers.
I gasp and clutch a hand to my chest.
My heart just disintegrated at the sound
of his voice.
“I don’t . . . speak . . . well,” he says
with a quiet and unsure voice.
Oh, my heart. Hearing him speak is
almost too much to take in. Each word
that meets my ears is enough to bring me
to my knees, and it’s not even the sound
of his voice or the quality of his speech.
It’s the fact that he’s choosing this
moment to speak for the first time in
fifteen years.
He pauses before finishing what he
needs to say and it gives my heart and
my lungs a moment to catch up with the
rest of me. He sounds exactly as I
imagined he would sound after hearing
his laughter so many times. His voice is
slightly deeper than his laughter, but
somewhat out of focus. His voice
reminds me of a photograph in a way. I
can understand his words, but they’re out
of focus. It’s as if I’m looking at a
picture and the subject is recognizable,
but not in focus . . . similar to his words.
I just fell in love with his voice. With
the out-of-focus picture he’s painting
with his words.
With . . . him.
He inhales softly, then nervously
exhales before continuing. “I need you . .
. to hear this,” he says, cradling my head
in his hands. “I . . . will never . . . regret
you.”
Beat, beat, pause.
Contract, expand.
Inhale, exhale.
I just officially lost the war on my
heart. I don’t even bother verbalizing a
response to him. My reaction can be
seen in my tears. He leans forward and
presses his lips to my forehead; then he
drops his hands and slowly backs away
from me. With each move he makes to
pull apart from me, I feel my heart
crumbling. I can almost hear us being
ripped apart. I can almost hear his heart
tearing in two, crashing to the floor right
next to mine.
As much as I know he should leave,
I’m a breath away from begging him to
stay. I want to fall to my knees, right next
to our shattered hearts, and beg him to
choose me. The pathetic part of me
wants to beg him just to kiss me, even if
he doesn’t choose me.
But the part of me that ultimately wins
is the part that keeps her mouth shut,
because I know Maggie deserves him
more than I do.
I keep my hands to my sides as he
backs away another step, preparing to
turn through my bedroom door. Our eyes
are still locked, but when my phone
sounds off in my pocket, I jump, quickly
tearing my gaze from his. I hear his
phone vibrate in his pocket. The sudden
interruption of both of our phones is only
obvious to me until he sees me opening
my cell phone at the same time as he
pulls his out of his pocket. Our eyes
meet briefly, but the interruption of the
outside world seems to have brought us
both back to the reality of our situation.
Back to the fact that his heart belongs
with someone else, and this is still goodbye.
I watch as he reads his text first. I’m
unable to take my eyes off of him in
order to read mine. His expression
quickly becomes tortured by whatever
words he’s reading, and he slowly
shakes his head.
He winces.
Until this very moment, I’d never seen
a heart break right before my eyes.
Whatever he just read has completely
shattered him.
He doesn’t look at me again. In one
swift movement, he grips his phone
tightly in his hand as if it’s become an
extension of him, and he heads straight
for the front door and swings it open. I
step out into the living room, watching
him in fear as I walk toward the front
door. He doesn’t even shut the door
behind him as he takes the stairs two at a
time, jumping over the edge of the
railing to shave off another half a second
in his frantic race to get to wherever it is
he desperately needs to be.
I look down at my phone and unlock
the screen. Maggie’s number shows as
the last incoming text message. I open it
and see that Ridge and I were the only
recipients. I read it carefully,
immediately recognizing the familiar
string of words she’s typed out to both of
us.
Maggie: “Maggie showed up last night
an hour after I got back to my room. I
was convinced you were going to
barge in and tell her what a jerk I am
for kissing you.”
I immediately walk to the couch and
sit, no longer able to support my body
weight. Her words knocked the breath
out of me, sucked the strength from my
limbs, and robbed me of any sense of
dignity I thought I had left.
I try to recall the medium through
which Ridge’s words were initially
typed.
His laptop.
Oh, no. Our messages.
Maggie is reading our messages. No,
no, no.
She won’t understand. She’ll only see
the words that’ll hurt. She won’t be able
to see how much Ridge has been fighting
this for her.
Another text shows up from Maggie,
and I don’t want to read it. I don’t want
to see our conversation through
Maggie’s eyes.
Maggie: “I never thought it was
possible to have honest feelings for
more than one person, but you’ve
convinced me of how incredibly wrong
I was.”
I turn my phone on silent and toss it
onto the couch beside me, then start
crying into my hands.
How could I do this to her?
How could I do to her what was done
to me, knowing it’s the worst feeling in
the world?
I’ve never in my life known this kind
of shame.
Several minutes pass, full of regrets,
before I realize the front door is still
wide open. I leave my phone on the
couch and walk to the door to shut it, but
my eyes are drawn to the cab pulled up
directly in front of our complex. Maggie
is stepping out, looking up at me as she
closes the door. I’m not at all prepared
to see her, so I quickly step back out of
her sight to regain my bearings. I don’t
know if I should go hide in my room or
stay out here and try to explain Ridge’s
innocence in all of this.
But how would I do that? She
obviously read the conversations
herself. She knows we kissed. She
knows he admitted having feelings for
me. As much as I can try to convince her
that he did everything he could not to
feel that way, it doesn’t excuse the fact
that the guy she’s in love with has openly
admitted his feelings for someone else.
Nothing can excuse that, and I feel like
complete shit for being a part of it.
I’m still standing with the door open
when she makes it to the top of the stairs.
She’s looking at me with a stern
expression. I know she’s more than
likely here for anything other than me, so
I take a step back and open the door
wider. She looks down at her feet when
she passes me, unable to continue the
eye contact.
I don’t blame her. I wouldn’t be able
to look at me, either. In fact, if I were
her, I’d be punching me right now.
She heads to the kitchen counter, and
she drops Ridge’s laptop onto it without
delicacy. Then she heads straight to
Ridge’s room. I hear her rummaging
through stuff, and she eventually comes
out with a bag in one hand and her car
keys in the other. I’m still standing
motionless with my hands on the door.
She continues to keep her eyes focused
on the floor as she passes me again, but
this time, she makes a quick movement
with her hand and wipes away a tear.
She walks out the door, down the
stairs, and straight to her car, never
speaking a word.
I wanted her to tell me she hated me. I
wanted her to punch me and scream at
me and call me a bitch. I wanted her to
give me a reason to be angry, because
right now, my heart is breaking for her,
and I know there isn’t a damn thing I
could say to make her better. I know this
for a fact, because I’ve recently been in
the same situation that Ridge and I have
just put her in.
We just made her a Sydney.
Ridge
The third and final text comes through
when I pull up to the hospital. I know
it’s the final text, because it’s pulled
from the conversation I had with Sydney
less than two hours ago. It’s the very last
thing I messaged her.
Maggie: “Don’t thank me, Sydney. You
shouldn’t thank me, because I failed
miserably at trying not to fall in love
with you.”
I can’t take any more. I throw the
phone into the passenger seat and exit
the vehicle, then sprint into the hospital
and straight up to her room. I push open
the door and rush inside, preparing to do
whatever I can to persuade her to hear
me out.
When I’m inside her room, I’m
instantly gutted.
She’s gone.
I press my palms against my forehead
and pace the empty room, trying to figure
out how I can take it all back. She read
everything. Every single conversation
I’ve ever had with Sydney on my laptop.
Every single honest feeling I’ve shared,
every joke we’ve made, every flaw
we’ve listed.
Why was I so damn careless?
Twenty-four years I’ve lived without
ever experiencing this type of hatred. It’s
the type of hatred that completely
overwhelms the conscience. It’s the type
of hatred that excuses otherwise
inexcusable actions. It’s the type of
hatred that can be felt in every facet of
the body and in every inch of the soul.
I’ve never known it until this moment.
I’ve never hated anything or anyone with
as much intensity as I hate myself right
now.
Chapter Twenty
Sydney
“Are you crying?” Bridgette asks
without compassion as she comes
through the front door. Warren follows
closely behind her, but he pauses the
second his eyes meet mine.
I don’t know how long I’ve been
sitting motionless on the couch, but it
still isn’t long enough for reality to have
been absorbed just yet. I’m still hoping
this is a dream. Or a nightmare. This
isn’t how things were supposed to turn
out.
“Sydney?” Warren says hesitantly. He
knows something is wrong, because I’m
sure my swollen, bloodshot eyes clearly
give me away.
I attempt to form an answer, but I fail
to come up with one. As much a part of
this as I am, I still feel that Ridge and
Maggie’s situation isn’t mine to be
sharing.
Luckily, Warren doesn’t have to ask
me what’s wrong, because I’m spared by
Ridge’s presence. He’s barging through
the front door, taking both Bridgette’s
and Warren’s attention off of me.
He pushes between the two of them
and heads straight for his room. He
swings open the door, then comes out
through the bathroom seconds later. He
looks at Warren and signs something.
Warren shrugs and signs back, but I can’t
follow their conversation at all.
When Ridge responds again, Warren
looks directly at me. “What does he
mean?” Warren asks me.
I shrug. “I failed to learn sign
language between now and the last time
we spoke, Warren. How the hell should
I know?”
I don’t know where my unwarranted
sarcasm is coming from, but I feel
Warren should have anticipated that one.
He shakes his head. “Where’s
Maggie, Sydney?” Warren points at the
counter toward Ridge’s computer. “He
says she had his computer, so she had to
come by here after she left the hospital.”
I look at Ridge to answer but can’t
deny the fact that jealousy is coursing
through me at watching his reaction
when it comes to Maggie. “I don’t know
where she went. All she did was walk
in, set your computer down, and grab her
things. She’s been gone for half an
hour.”
Warren is signing everything I’m
saying to Ridge. When he finishes, Ridge
runs a frustrated hand through his hair,
then takes a step toward me. His eyes
are angry and hurt, and he begins signing
with forceful movements of his hands.
His obvious anger makes me wince, but
his disappointment in me fills me with
my own share of anger.
“He wants to know how you could
just let her leave,” Warren says.
I immediately stand up and look Ridge
directly in the eye. “What did you expect
me to do, Ridge? Lock her in the damn
closet? You can’t be mad at me for this!
I’m not the one who failed to delete
messages I wouldn’t want someone else
to read!”
I don’t wait for Warren to finish
signing for Ridge. I walk to my bedroom
and slam the door behind me, then drop
down onto my bed. Moments later, I hear
the door to Ridge’s bedroom slam shut,
too. The sounds don’t stop there, though.
I hear things crashing against his
bedroom walls, one by one, as he takes
his frustration out on any inanimate
object in his path.
I don’t hear the knock through the
sounds coming from Ridge’s bedroom.
My door opens, and Warren slips inside.
He shuts my bedroom door, then leans
his back against it. “What happened?” he
asks.
I turn my head to face the other
direction. I don’t want to answer him,
and I don’t want to look at him, because
I know anything I say to him will only
cause him to be disappointed in Ridge
and me. I don’t want him to be
disappointed in Ridge.
“Are you okay?” His voice is closer
now. He sits down on the bed beside me
and places a comforting hand on my
back. The reassuring contact from him
causes me to break down again as I bury
my face in my arms. I feel as though I’m
drowning, but I have no fight left to even
bother coming up for air.
“You said something about messages
to Ridge. Did Maggie read something
that upset her?”
I turn my head back over and look up
at him. “Go ask Ridge, Warren. It’s not
my place to tell you Maggie’s business.”
Warren purses his lips in a tight line,
nodding slowly while he thinks. “I kind
of think it is your place, though. Isn’t it?
Does it not have everything to do with
you? And I can’t ask Ridge. I’ve never
seen him like this before, and frankly,
I’m a little terrified of him right now.
But I’m worried about Maggie, and I
need you to tell me what happened so I
can figure out if there’s anything I can do
to help.”
I close my eyes, wondering how I can
answer Warren’s question with a
simplified response. I open my eyes and
look at him again. “Don’t be angry with
him, Warren. The only thing Ridge has
done wrong is fail to delete a few
messages.”
Warren tilts his head and narrows his
doubtful eyes. “If that’s the only thing
Ridge did wrong, then why is Maggie
avoiding him? Are you saying that the
messages she read weren’t wrong?
Whatever has been going on between the
two of you isn’t wrong?”
I don’t like the condescending
undertone in his voice. I sit up on the
bed and scoot back, putting space
between the two of us as I respond. “The
fact that Ridge has been honest in his
conversations with me is not something
he did wrong. The fact that he has
feelings for me also isn’t wrong, when
you know exactly how much he’s fought
those feelings. People can’t control
matters of the heart, Warren. They can
only control their actions, which is
exactly what Ridge did. He lost control
once for ten seconds, but after that, every
single time temptation reared its ugly
head, he walked in the other direction.
The only thing Ridge has done wrong is
fail to delete his messages, because by
doing so, he failed to protect Maggie. He
failed to protect her from the harsh truth
that people don’t get to choose who they
fall in love with. They only get to choose
who they stay in love with.” I look up at
the ceiling and blink back tears. “He
was choosing to stay in love with her,
Warren. Why can’t she see that? This
will kill him so much more than it’s
killing her.”
I fall back onto the bed, and Warren
remains beside me, quiet and still.
Several long moments pass, and then he
stands and slowly makes his way to my
bedroom door. “I owe you an apology,”
he says.
“An apology for what?”
He drops his eyes to the floor and
shifts his feet. “I didn’t think you were
good enough for him, Sydney.” He
slowly brings his gaze back to mine.
“You are. You and Maggie both are.
This is the first moment since meeting
Ridge that I don’t envy him.”
He leaves the room, somehow having
made me feel the tiniest bit better and a
whole hell of a lot worse.
I continue to lie still on my bed,
listening for the sound of Ridge’s anger
to return, but it doesn’t. It’s completely
quiet throughout the apartment. The only
thing any of us can hear is the lingering
shattering of Maggie’s heart.
I pick up my phone for the first time
since I put it on silent and see that I have
a missed text from Ridge, sent just a few
minutes ago.
Ridge: I changed my mind. I need you
to leave today.
Ridge
I pile a few things into a bag, hoping I’ll
actually need it once I get to her house. I
have no idea if Maggie will even allow
me to step through her front door, but the
only thing I can do right now is be
optimistic, because the alternative is
unacceptable. It just is. I refuse to accept
that this is it.
I know she’s hurt, and I know she
hates me right now, but she has to
understand how much she means to me
and how my feelings for Sydney were
never intentional.
I clench my fists again, wondering
why in the hell I ever had those
conversations with Sydney in the first
place. Or why I failed to delete them. I
never thought Maggie would be in a
position to read them. I guess in a way, I
just didn’t feel guilty. The way I’ve felt
toward Sydney wasn’t something I
wanted to happen, but the feelings are
there, and refusing to act on them since
our initial kiss has taken a hell of a lot of
effort. In an oddly sadistic way, I’ve
actually been proud of myself for being
able to fight it the way I have.
But Maggie won’t see that side of it,
and I completely understand. I k now
Maggie, and if she read all the messages,
she’s more upset about the connection
I’ve made with Sydney than she is over
the fact that I k issed her. The feelings I
have for Sydney aren’t something I’m
sure I can talk my way out of.
I grab my bag and my phone and head
into the kitchen to pack the laptop. When
I reach the counter, I notice a piece of
paper peeking out from the computer. I
find a sticky note stuck to the screen.
Ridge,
It was never my intention to read
your personal stuff, but when I opened
your laptop, it was all right there in
front of me. I read all of it, and I wish I
never saw it. Please give me time to
process everything before you show up.
I’ll contact you when I’m ready to talk
in a few days.
Maggie
A few days?
God, please don’t let her be serious.
There’s no way my heart will survive
this for a few days. I’ll be lucky if I
make it through the end of today knowing
how I’ve made her feel.
I toss my bag back toward my
bedroom door since I won’t need it for a
while. I lean forward in defeat and rest
my elbows on the bar, crumpling the
note up in my fist. I stare down at the
laptop before me.
Piece of shit computer.
Why the hell didn’t I have a password
on it? Why the hell didn’t I take it with
me when I left the hospital? Why the hell
didn’t I delete everything? Why the hell
did I even write anything to Sydney in
the first place?
I’ve never hated an inanimate object
as much as I hate this computer. I slam
the screen shut and bring my fist down
on top of it with all my strength. I wish I
could hear it crack. I wish I could hear
the sound my fist makes each time I bring
it down forcefully. I want to hear it
crushed beneath my fist the same way my
heart feels crushed inside my chest.
I stand up straight and pick the laptop
up, then slam it down on the bar. I see
Warren exit his bedroom out of the
corner of my eye, but I’m too pissed to
care if I’m making too much noise. I
continue to pick the laptop up and slam it
against the bar over and over, but it
doesn’t diminish the hatred I feel for it in
the least, and it also doesn’t do enough
damage to the casing. Warren walks
toward the kitchen and heads to a
cabinet. He reaches inside and grabs
something, then walks over to me. I
pause my attack on the computer and
look up to see him holding out a hammer.
I gladly take it, then step back and bring
the hammer down against the laptop with
all my might. This time, I can actually
see the cracks appear with each hit.
Much better.
I hit it over and over and watch as
pieces fly in all directions. I’m also
leaving a hefty amount of damage on the
bar beneath my mangled computer, but I
don’t give a shit. Countertops are
replaceable. What this computer
destroyed of Maggie isn’t.
When there isn’t much left of the
computer to destroy, I finally drop the
hammer on the bar. I’m out of breath. I
turn and slide down to the floor with my
back against the cabinets.
Warren walks around me and sits on
the floor in front of me, resting his back
against the wall behind him. “Feel
better?” he signs.
I shake my head. I don’t feel better, I
just feel worse. Now I know for a fact
that it’s not the laptop I’m mad at. It’s
me. I’m mad at myself.
“Anything I can do to help?”
I ponder his question. The only thing
that could help me get Maggie back is to
prove to her that there’s nothing going on
between me and Sydney. In order to
prove that to her, I need to not have any
interaction with Sydney whatsoever.
That’s kind of hard with her in the very
next room.
“Can you help Sydney move?” I sign.
“Today?”
Warren lowers his chin at my request,
eyeing me with disappointment. “Today?
Her apartment won’t be ready for three
more days. Besides, she needs furniture,
and what we ordered this morning isn’t
even being delivered until the day she
moves in.”
I pull my wallet out of my pocket and
remove my credit card. “Take her to a
hotel, then. I’ll pay for her room until her
apartment is ready. I need her out in case
Maggie comes back. She can’t be here.”
Warren takes my card and stares at it
for several seconds before bringing his
eyes back to mine. “This is kind of a
shitty move considering this is your
fault. Don’t expect me to be the one to
ask her to leave today. You owe her that
much.”
I have to admit, Warren’s reaction
surprises me. Yesterday he seemed to
hate Sydney. Today he’s acting as if he’s
protecting her. “I already told her I need
her to leave today. Do me a favor, and
make sure she gets moved in okay this
week. Get her anything she needs.
Groceries, extra furniture, whatever.”
I’m beginning to stand up when the
door to Sydney’s room opens. She’s
walking out backward, pulling both of
her suitcases. Warren scrambles to his
feet next to me, and as soon as she turns
around and her eyes lock with mine, she
freezes.
The guilt over what I’m having her do
hits me when I see the tears in her eyes.
She doesn’t deserve this. She hasn’t
done anything to deserve all that I’ve put
her through. The way it makes me feel to
know I’ve hurt her is exactly why I need
her to leave, because I shouldn’t care
this much.
But I do. God, I care about her so
much.
I break eye contact with her and look
back to Warren. “Thank you for helping
her,” I sign. I head back to my room, not
wanting to watch Sydney walk out the
front door. I can’t imagine losing both
her and Maggie in the course of a few
hours, but it’s actually happening.
Warren grabs my arm as I pass him,
forcing me to turn and look at him. “You
aren’t even going to tell her good-bye?”
he signs.
“I can’t tell her good-bye when I don’t
really want her to leave.” I continue
toward my room, thankful that I can’t
hear the sound of the front door closing
behind her when she leaves. I don’t
know if I could take it.
I pick up my phone and lie down on
my bed. I pull up Maggie’s number and
send her a text.
Me: I’ll give you however much time
you need. I love you more than you
even realize. I’m not going to deny
anything I said to Sydney, because it
was all true, especially the parts about
you and how much I love you. I know
you’re hurt, and I know I betrayed
you, but please. You have to know how
much I’ve fought for you. Please don’t
end us like this.
I hit the send button and pull the phone
to my chest.
Then I fucking cry.
Chapter Twenty One
Sydney
“Let me get those,” Warren says as he
bends to pick up my suitcases. He
carries them down the steps, and I
follow him. Once we make it to his car, I
realize I don’t even know where I’m
going. I haven’t thought this far ahead.
As soon as Ridge told me he needed me
to leave today, I just packed my things
and walked out without even a plan for
what I’m going to do for the next three
days. My new apartment isn’t ready, but
I’m wishing I could be in it. I want to be
as far away as I can get right now from
Ridge and Maggie and Warren and
Bridgette and Hunter and Tori and
everything and everyone.
“Ridge wants me to take you to a hotel
until your apartment is ready, but is there
anywhere else you’d rather go?”
Warren is now sitting in the driver’s
seat, and I’m in the front passenger’s
seat. I don’t even remember our getting
into his car. I turn and look at him, and
he’s just staring at me. The car hasn’t
even been cranked yet.
God, I feel so pathetic. I feel like a
burden.
“It’s laughable, isn’t it?” I say.
“What?”
I gesture to myself. “This.” I lean my
head against the headrest and close my
eyes. “I should just go back home to my
parents. I’m obviously not cut out for
this.”
Warren sighs. “Not cut out for what?
College? Real life?”
I shake my head. “Independence in
general, really. Hunter was right when
he told me I’d be better off living with
him than on my own. He was right about
that, at least. I’ve been in Ridge’s life
less than three months, and I’ve
successfully ruined his entire
relationship with Maggie.” I look out the
window, up to his empty balcony. “I’ve
also ruined his entire friendship with
me.” Warren cranks the car, then reaches
over and squeezes my hand. “Today is a
really bad day, Syd. A really, really bad
day. Sometimes in life, we need a few
bad days in order to keep the good ones
in perspective.” He lets go of my hand
and backs out of the parking spot. “And
you’ve made it this long without having
to go back to your parents. You can
make it three more days.”
“I can’t afford a hotel, Warren. I spent
my savings on furniture and the deposit
for the new apartment. Just take me to
the bus station. I’ll go stay with my
parents for a few days.” I pick up my
phone in order to bite the bullet and call
them, but Warren pulls it out of my
hands.
“First of all, you need to stop blaming
yourself for what’s happening with
Ridge and Maggie. Ridge is his own
person, and he knows right from wrong.
He was the one in the relationship, not
you. Second, you need to allow Ridge to
pay for this hotel, because he’s the one
making you leave without a notice. As
much as I love the guy, he sort of owes
you big-time.”
I watch the empty balcony as we drive
away. “Why do I feel like I’ve been
taking Ridge’s handouts since the day I
met him?” I look away from the balcony,
feeling the anger building in my chest,
but I don’t even know who I’m mad at.
Love, maybe? I think I’m mad at love.
“I don’t know why you feel the way
you do,” Warren says, “but you need to
stop. You’ve never asked any of us for a
single thing.”
I nod, trying to agree with him.
Maybe Warren is right. Ridge is just
as guilty in this as I am. He’s the one in
the relationship. He should have asked
me to leave as soon as he knew he was
developing feelings for me. He also
should have given me more than five
minutes to move out. He made me feel
like more of a liability than someone
he’s supposed to care about.
“You’re right, Warren. And you know
what? If Ridge is paying, I want you to
take me to a really nice hotel. One with
room service and a minibar full of tiny
bottles of Pine-Sol.”
Warren laughs. “That’s my girl.”
Ridge
It’s been seventy-two hours.
Three days.
Enough time for me to come up with
even more things I need to say to
Maggie. Enough time for Warren to let
me know that Sydney is finally in her
own apartment. He wouldn’t tell me
which one, but that’s probably for the
best.
Seventy-two hours has also been
enough time for me to realize that I miss
having Sydney in my life almost as much
as I miss Maggie. And it’s enough time
to know that I’m not going another day
without talking to Maggie. I need to
know that she’s okay. I’ve done nothing
but pace this apartment since the moment
I lost her.
Since the moment I lost both of them.
I pick up my phone and palm it for
several minutes, too scared to text her.
I’m afraid of what her response will be.
When I finally do type out a text, I close
my eyes and hit send.
Me: Are you ready to talk about it?
I stare at my phone, waiting for her to
respond. I want to know if she’s okay. I
want to be able to tell her my side. The
fact that she’s more than likely thinking
the worst is killing me, and it feels as if I
haven’t been able to breathe since she
found out about Sydney and me.
Maggie: I’ll never be ready, but it
needs to be done. I’m home all night.
As ready as I am to see her, I’m also
scared to death. I don’t want to see her
heartbroken.
Me: I’ll be there in an hour.
I grab my things and head straight out
the door—straight back to the half of my
heart that needs the most mending.
• • •
I have a key to her place. I’ve had a key
to her place for three years, but I haven’t
had to ring her doorbell in all that time.
I’m ringing her doorbell right now,
and it doesn’t feel right. It feels as
though I’m asking permission to break
through an invisible barrier that
shouldn’t even be here in the first place.
I take a step away from the door and
wait.
After several painfully long seconds,
she opens the door and makes brief eye
contact with me as she steps aside to let
me in. I pictured her on the drive over
with her hair a mess, makeup smudged
underneath her eyes from all the crying,
and sporting three-day-old pajamas. The
typical heartbroken attire for a girl who
just lost all trust in the man she loves.
I think I would rather she looked the
way I pictured her than how she actually
looks. She’s dressed in her typical jeans,
and her hair is neatly pulled back. There
isn’t a smudge of makeup on her face or
a tear in her eyes. She gives me a faint
smile as she closes the front door.
I watch her closely, because I’m not
sure what to do. Of course, my first
instinct is to pull her to me and kiss her,
but my first instinct probably isn’t the
best. Instead, I wait until she goes into
her living room. I follow her, wishing
more than anything that she would turn
toward me and throw her arms around
me. She does turn to face me before she
takes a seat, but she doesn’t throw her
arms around me.
“Well?” she signs. “How do we do
this?” Her expression is hesitant and
pained, but at least she’s confronting it. I
know this is hard for her.
“How about we quit acting like we’re
not allowed to be ourselves?” I sign.
“This has been the hardest three days of
my life, and I can’t go another second
without touching you.”
I don’t give her a chance to respond
before my arms are wrapped around her
and I’m pulling her against me. She
doesn’t resist. Her arms wrap tightly
around me, and as soon as my cheek is
pressed against the top of her head, I feel
her begin to cry.
This is the Maggie I need. The
vulnerable Maggie. The Maggie who
still loves me, despite what I’ve put her
through.
I hug her and pull her to the couch,
keeping her secured against me as I sit
with her now on my lap. We continue to
hold each other, neither of us knowing
how to begin the conversation. I press a
long kiss into her hair.
What I wouldn’t give to just be able to
whisper all my apologies into her ear. I
want her as close to me as possible
while I tell her how sorry I am, but I
can’t do that and sign everything I need
to say at the same time. I hate these
moments in life where I’d give anything
to be able to communicate the same way
so many others take for granted.
She slowly lifts her face, and I
reluctantly let her pull back. She keeps
her palms pressed against my chest and
looks me directly in the eyes.
“Are you in love with her?” she asks.
She doesn’t sign her question; she
only speaks it. The fact that she doesn’t
sign it makes me think it was too hard
for her even to ask. So hard that maybe
she doesn’t really want to know the
answer, so she didn’t really want me to
understand her question.
I did understand it.
I grab both of her hands pressed
against my chest, and I lift them, kissing
each of her palms before releasing her
hands to answer her.
“I’m in love with you, Maggie.”
Her expression is tight and controlled.
“That’s not what I asked.”
I look away from her, not wanting her
to see the struggle in my eyes. I close
them and remind myself that lying won’t
get us back to where we need to be.
Maggie’s smart. She also deserves
honesty, which isn’t at all what I’ve
been giving her. I open my eyes and look
at her. I don’t answer her with a yes or a
no. I shrug, because I honestly don’t
know if I’m in love with Sydney. How
could I be when I’m in love with
Maggie? It shouldn’t be possible for the
heart to love more than one person at
once.
She diverts her eyes away and scoots
off my lap. She stands and slowly walks
the length of the living room and back.
She’s thinking, so I give her a moment. I
know my answer has hurt her, but I know
a lie would have hurt her even more. She
finally turns to me.
“I can spend all night asking you
really brutal questions, Ridge. I don’t
want to do that. I’ve had a lot of time to
think this through, and I have a lot I need
to say to you.”
“If brutal questions will help you, then
ask me brutal questions. Please. We’ve
been together five years, and I can’t let
this tear us apart.”
She shakes her head, then takes a seat
on the couch opposite me. “I don’t need
to ask the questions, because I already
know all the answers. I just need to talk
to you now about where we go from
here.”
I lean forward, not liking where this is
going. I don’t like it at all. “At least,
allow me to explain myself. You can’t
come to a decision about what happens
to us without hearing me out first.”
She shakes her head again, and my
heart clenches. “I already know, Ridge. I
know you. I know your heart. I’ve read
your conversations with Sydney. I
already know what you’re going to tell
me. You’re going to tell me how much
you love me. How you would do
anything for me. You’re going to
apologize for developing feelings for
another girl, despite how hard you tried
to prevent that from happening. You’re
going to tell me you love me so much
more than I know and how your
relationship with me is so much more
important to you than your feelings for
Sydney. You’re going to tell me you’ll
do anything to make it up to me and that I
just need to give you a chance. You’re
probably going to be brutally honest
with me, also, and tell me that you do
have feelings for Sydney but they don’t
compare to how you feel about me.”
She stands and moves to sit next to me
on the couch. There are traces of tears in
her eyes, but she isn’t crying anymore.
She faces me and begins signing again.
“And you know what, Ridge? I
believe you. And I understand all of it. I
do. I’ve read your conversations. It’s as
if I was right there, sifting through it all
while the two of you were attempting to
fight whatever was developing between
you. I keep telling myself to quit logging
back into your account, but I can’t stop.
I’ve read those conversations a million
times. I deciphered every word, every
sentence, every punctuation mark. I
wanted to find the spot in your
conversations that proved your
disloyalty to me. I wanted to find the
moment in your conversations where you
became this despicable excuse for a man
by admitting that what you felt for her
was purely sexual. God, Ridge. I wanted
to find that moment so bad, but I
couldn’t. I know you kissed her, but even
the kiss seemed excusable after the two
of you had that open discussion about it.
I’m your girlfriend, and even I began to
excuse it.
“I’m not saying what you did is
readily forgivable, by any means. You
should have asked her to move out the
second you felt compelled to kiss her.
Hell, you shouldn’t have ever asked her
to move in if there was even the slightest
possibility that you were attracted to her.
What you did was wrong in every sense
of the word, but what’s so messed up is
that I feel like I understand it. Maybe it’s
because I know you too well, but the fact
that you’re falling in love with Sydney is
obvious, and I can’t just sit back and
share your heart with her, Ridge. I can’t
do it.”
No, no, no, no, no. I quickly pull her
to me, wanting the comfort of her to
subdue the panic building within me.
She can be heartbroken. She can even
be pissed or terrified, but the one thing I
won’t let her be is okay. She can’t just
be okay with this.
Tears begin to sting my eyes as I hold
her as if my embrace is somehow
supposed to convince her of how I feel.
I’m shaking my head no, trying to get her
not to take this conversation where I’m
afraid it’s headed.
I press my lips against hers in an
attempt to make it all go away. I hold her
face in the palms of my hands and try
desperately to show her how I feel
without having to pull apart from her
again.
Her lips part, and I kiss her,
something I’ve done on a regular basis
for more than five years but never with
so much conviction or fear.
Her mouth tastes of tears, and I’m not
sure whose they are, because we’re both
crying now. She pushes against my chest,
wanting to speak to me, but I don’t want
her to. I don’t want to watch her tell me
how okay my feelings for Sydney are.
They’re not okay. They shouldn’t be
okay at all.
She sits up and pushes me away from
her, then wipes her tears. I lean my
elbow into the couch and cover my
mouth with my trembling hand.
“There’s more. There’s so much more
I need to tell you, and I need you to give
me the opportunity to get it out, okay?”
I simply nod, when all I want to do is
tell her how hearing her out is the last
thing my heart can take right now. She
adjusts herself and pulls her legs onto
the couch. She wraps her arms around
them and rests her cheek on her knee,
looking away from me. She’s still and
quiet and contemplating.
I’m a complete wreck as I sit here and
wait.
She unwraps her hands from around
her legs and slowly lifts her head to look
me in the eyes. “Remember the day we
met?” she asks.
There’s a faint smile in her eyes, and
my panic eases slightly at the
pleasantness in her memory. I nod.
“I noticed you first, before I noticed
Warren. When Warren approached me, I
was hoping he was approaching me for
you. I remember making eye contact with
you over his shoulder, because I wanted
to smile at you so you would know that
you caught my eye the same way I caught
yours. But when I realized Warren
wasn’t approaching me for you, I was
disappointed. There was something
about you that tugged at me in a way that
Warren didn’t, but you didn’t seem to
have that same reaction to me. Warren
was cute, so I agreed to go out with him,
especially since I thought you weren’t
into me that day.”
I close my eyes and soak in her words
for a moment. I never knew this. I’m not
sure at this point that I want to know
this. After several quiet moments, I
reluctantly open my eyes again and let
her finish.
“For the short time I dated Warren,
you and I would have these brief
conversations and moments of eye
contact that always seemed to make you
uncomfortable, and I knew it made you
uncomfortable because you were
developing feelings for me. But your
loyalty to Warren was so strong that you
wouldn’t allow yourself to go there. I
always admired that about you, because
I knew the two of us would have worked
so well. To be honest, I was secretly
hoping you would betray his friendship
and just kiss me or something, because
you were all I thought about. I’m not
even sure I was with Warren for
Warren. I think I was with him for you
all along.
“Then, a few weeks after Warren and
I broke up, I began to think I’d never see
you again, because you never came for
me like I hoped you would. The thought
of that terrified me, so I showed up at
your apartment one day. You weren’t
there, but Brennan was. I think he knew
why I was there, so he told me not to
worry, that I just needed to give you
time. He told me about the deal you and
Warren made and that you really did
have feelings for me but didn’t feel right
pursuing them yet. He even showed me
the date you had circled on the calendar.
I’ll never forget how that made me feel,
and from that point on, I counted down
the days until you showed up at my front
door.”
She wipes away a tear. I briefly close
my eyes and try to show her respect by
not allowing myself to pull her to me
again, but it’s so hard. I never knew she
came for me. Brennan never told me, and
right now, I’m struggling with wanting to
let him know how pissed I am that he
kept quiet and how much I love him for
informing Maggie of how I felt.
“I fell in love with you during that
year of waiting for you. I fell in love
with your loyalty to Warren. I fell in
love with your loyalty to me. I fell in
love with your patience and your
willpower. I fell in love with the fact
that you didn’t want to start things out
wrong with us. You wanted everything
to be as right as it could be, so you
waited an entire year. Believe me,
Ridge. I know how hard it was, because
I was waiting right along with you.”
I lift my hand and wipe a tear from her
cheek, then let her finish.
“I swore I wouldn’t allow my illness
to interfere with us. I wouldn’t let it
prevent me from completely falling in
love with you. I wouldn’t let it be my
crutch to push you away. You were so
adamant that it didn’t matter to you, and I
was so desperate to believe you. We
were both lying to ourselves. I think my
illness is the thing you love the most
about me.”
My breath catches in my throat. Those
words hurt me more than any words ever
have. “Why would you say something
like that, Maggie?”
“I know it sounds absurd to you
because you don’t see it that way. It’s
who you are. You’re loyal. You love
people to a fault. You want to take care
of everyone around you, including me,
Brennan, Warren . . . Sydney. It’s just
who you are, and seeing how Warren
treated me back then made you want to
jump in and become my hero. I’m not
saying you don’t love me for me,
because I know you do. I just think you
love me the wrong way.”
I run my palm over my forehead and
try to squeeze the pain away. My head
can’t take another second of listening to
how incredibly wrong she is. “Maggie,
stop. If you’re about to use your illness
as an excuse to leave me, I won’t listen
to it. I can’t. You’re talking like you’re
about to just give up on us, and it’s
scaring the living hell out of me. I didn’t
come here for you to give up. I need you
to fight with me. I need you to fight for
us.”
She tilts her head to the side, slowly
shaking it in disagreement. “I shouldn’t
have to fight for us, Ridge. I fight every
goddamned day of my life just to
survive. I should be able to revel in us,
but I can’t. I’m constantly living in fear
that I’m going to upset you or make you
angry because you want so badly to form
a protective bubble around me. You
don’t want me taking risks or doing
anything that causes me one iota of
stress. You don’t see the point in my
going to college, since we both know my
fate. You don’t see the point in me
having a career, because you think it’s
better if I just let you take care of me
while I take it easy. You don’t
understand my yearning to experience
the things that give people that rush of
adrenaline. You get mad when I bring up
the idea of traveling, because you don’t
think it’s safe for my health. You refuse
to go on tour with your brother, because
you want to be the one to take care of me
when I get sick. You give up so much of
your life to make sure I’m not having to
give up any of mine, and sometimes it’s
so suffocating.”
Suffocating?
I’m suffocating?
I stand up and pace the room for
several moments, attempting to breathe
the air back into my lungs that she’s
repeatedly knocking out. After I’m calm
enough to respond, I return to the couch
and face her again.
“I’m not trying to suffocate you,
Maggie. I just want to protect you. We
don’t have the luxury of time like every
other couple. Is it wrong that I want to
prolong what we have for as long as we
possibly can?”
“No, Ridge. It’s not wrong. I love that
about you so much, but I don’t love it for
me. It always feels as though you’re
trying to be my lifeguard. I don’t need a
lifeguard, Ridge. I need someone who is
willing to watch me brave the ocean and
then dare me not to drown. But you
wouldn’t be able to let me near the
ocean. It’s not your fault that you can’t
give me that.”
I know it’s just an analogy, but she’s
only using it to make excuses.
“You think that’s what you want,” I
sign. “It’s not. You can’t tell me you’d
rather be with someone who would
allow you to risk the time you have left
than have someone who would do
whatever he could to prolong his life
with you.”
She exhales. I can’t tell if she’s
admitting I’m right or if she’s frustrated
because I’m wrong. She looks me square
in the eyes and leans forward, then
briefly presses her lips to mine. As soon
as I lift my hands to her face, she pulls
back again.
“I’ve known all my life that I could
die at any moment. You don’t know what
that’s like, Ridge, but I want you to try to
put yourself in my shoes. If you knew all
your life that you were going to die at
any moment, would you be okay with
just barely living? Or would you live as
hard as you could? Because you’re
needing me to barely live, Ridge. I can’t
do that. When I die, I need to know that I
did everything I’ve ever wanted to do,
and I’ve seen everything I’ve ever
wanted to see, and I’ve loved everyone
I’ve ever wanted to love. I can’t just
barely live anymore, and it’s not in your
nature to stick by my side and watch me
do all the things I still have left to do in
my life.
“You’ve spent five years of your life
loving me like no one’s ever loved me.
My love has matched yours minute for
minute. I don’t want you to ever doubt
that. People take so much for granted,
and I never want you to feel that I took
you for granted. Everything you do for
me is so much more than I deserve, and
you need to know how much that means
to me. But there are times when I feel
like our devotion to each other is tying
us down. Keeping us both from really
living. The past few days have helped
me realize that I’m still with you
because I’m scared to break your heart.
But if I don’t find the courage to do it,
I’m scared I’ll just keep holding you
back. Holding myself back. I feel like I
can’t live the life I want to live for fear
of hurting you, and you can’t live the life
you want to live because your heart is
too loyal for your own good. As much as
it hurts me to admit this, I think I might
be better off without you. I also think that
maybe someday you’ll realize you’re
better off without me.”
My elbows meet my knees as I lean
forward and turn away from her. I can’t
watch her say another word to me. Every
single thing she’s saying is not only
breaking my heart, but it feels as if it’s
also breaking the heart within my heart.
It hurts so much, and I’m so damn
scared, because for a moment, I begin to
think there’s a possibility that she’s
right.
Maybe she doesn’t need me.
Maybe I do hold her back.
Maybe I’m not the hero to her I’ve
always tried so hard to be, because right
now, I feel as if she doesn’t even need a
hero. Why would she? She has someone
so much stronger than I’ll ever be for
her. She has herself.
The realization that I may not be what
she needs in her life consumes me, and
my regret and guilt and shame fold in on
themselves, completely devouring the
strength I have left.
I feel her arms wrap around me, and I
pull her to me, needing to feel her
against me. I love her so damn much, and
all I want right now is for her to know
that, even if it doesn’t change anything. I
pull her to me and press my forehead to
hers as we both cry, holding on to each
other with all we have left. Tears are
streaming down her cheeks as she slides
onto my lap.
She mouths, “I love you,” then presses
her lips to mine. I pull her against my
chest as close as I possibly can without
crawling inside of her, which is exactly
what my heart is trying to do. It wants to
embed itself within the walls of her
chest, and it never wants to let go.
Chapter Twenty Two
Sydney
My cable won’t be connected until next
week. My eyes hurt from reading too
much, and maybe also from crying. I
finally put a down payment on a car with
my leftover student loans, but until I get
a job, I can’t really afford the gas. I’d
better find a job soon, because I’m pretty
sure I’ve fictionalized how great living
alone is. I’m tempted to try to get my job
back at the library, even if I have to beg.
I just need something to keep me busy.
I’m. Freaking. Bored.
So bored that I’m looking at my hands,
counting random things that make
absolutely no sense to even be counting.
One: the number of people constantly
on my mind. (Ridge.)
Two: the number of people I wish
would contract a sexually transmitted
disease. (Hunter and Tori.)
Three: the number of months since I
broke up with my lying, cheating bastard
of a boyfriend.
Four: the number of times Warren has
checked up on me since I moved out of
the apartment.
Five: the number of times Warren has
knocked on my door in the last thirty
seconds.
Six: the number of days since I last
saw Ridge.
Seven: the number of feet from my
couch to the front door.
I open the door, and Warren doesn’t
even wait for me to invite him in. He
smiles and slips past me, holding two
white bags in his hands.
“I brought tacos,” he says. “I was
driving by on my way home from work
and thought you might want some.” He
sets the bags on my kitchen counter, then
walks to the sofa and plops down.
I close the door and face him. “Thanks
for the tacos, but how do I know you
aren’t pranking me? What’d you do,
switch the beef out with tobacco?”
Warren looks up at me and grins,
impressed. “Now, that’s a genius prank
idea, Sydney. I think you might finally be
getting the hang of it.”
I laugh and take a seat next to him.
“Figures, now that I have no roommates
to prank.”
He laughs and pats my knee.
“Bridgette doesn’t get off work until
midnight. Want to go catch a movie?”
My head sinks into the back of the
couch almost as quickly as my heart
sinks into my stomach. I hate feeling as if
he’s only here because he feels sorry for
me. The last thing I want to be is
someone’s worry.
“Warren, you don’t have to keep
coming by here to check on me every
day. I know you’re trying to be nice, but
I’m fine.” He shifts his weight on the
couch so that he’s facing me.
“I’m not coming by here because I
feel sorry for you, Sydney. You’re my
friend. I miss having you around the
apartment. And I might be coming by
here because I feel a tad bit remorseful
for treating you like complete shit the
night Maggie was admitted to the
hospital.”
I nod. “Yeah. You were quite the
asshole that night.”
“I know.” He laughs. “Don’t worry,
Ridge hasn’t let me forget it.”
Ridge.
God, even hearing his name hurts.
Warren realizes his slip-up when he
sees the change in my expression. “Shit.
Sorry.”
I press my palms into the couch and
stand up, wanting to escape the
awkwardness of our conversation. It’s
really not a subject I need to be talking
about, anyway.
“Well, are you hungry?” I ask as I
head to the kitchen. “I just spent hours
slaving over the stove to make these
tacos, so you’d better eat one.”
Warren laughs, walks into the kitchen
with me, and takes one of the tacos. I
unwrap one and lean against the bar, but
before I even bring it to my mouth, I
become too nauseated to eat. In all
honesty, I haven’t slept or eaten very
much in the six days since I moved out. I
hate knowing that I had a part in causing
so much hurt in another person. Maggie
didn’t do anything to deserve how we
made her feel. It’s also hard as hell not
knowing how things have turned out
between the two of them. I haven’t asked
Warren about it for obvious reasons,
because whatever the outcome, it
wouldn’t change things. But now it feels
as if I have this huge, gaping hole in my
chest from the constant curiosity. As
much as I’ve wished for the last three
months that Ridge didn’t have a
girlfriend, it’s nothing compared to how
much I’ve hoped she could forgive him.
“Penny for your thoughts?”
I glance up at Warren, who’s leaning
against the counter, watching me think. I
shrug my shoulders and set my uneaten
food aside, then hug myself and stare
down at my feet, afraid that if I look
directly at him, he’ll know what I’m
thinking.
“Look,” he says, dipping his head to
try to get me to look him in the eye. “I
know you haven’t asked about him
because you know as well as I do how
much you need to move on. But if you
have questions, I’ll answer them,
Sydney. I’ll answer them because you’re
my friend, and that’s what friends do.”
My chest rises with my deep intake of
breath, and before I can fully release it,
the question spills from my mouth. “How
is he?”
Warren clenches his jaw, which
makes me think he wishes he hadn’t
given me the opening to ask about Ridge.
“He’s okay. He’ll be okay.”
I nod but instantly have a million
follow-up questions to ask.
Did she take him back?
Has he asked about me?
Does he seem happy?
Do you think he regrets me now?
I decide to take it one question at a
time, because I’m not even sure his
answers will be good for me at this
point. I swallow nervously, then look up
at him. “Did she forgive him?”
Warren is the one who can’t hold the
eye contact now. He straightens up, turns
around with his back to me, and places
his palms flat on the counter. His head
hangs between his shoulders as he sighs
uncomfortably.
“I’m not sure if I should be telling you
this.” He pauses for a moment, then turns
back around to face me. “She did forgive
him. From what he told me, she
understood the situation between you
and Ridge. I’m not saying she wasn’t
upset about it at all, but she did forgive
him.”
His answer completely slays me. I
slap my hand over my mouth to muffle
my cry, and then I turn away from
Warren. I’m confused by my reaction
and confused by my heart. I’m
immediately consumed with relief to
know that she forgave him, but the relief
washes away with grief at the realization
that she forgave him. I don’t even know
how to feel. I’m relieved for Ridge and
grieving for myself.
Warren sighs heavily, and I feel awful
for allowing him to see me react this
way. I shouldn’t have asked. Dammit,
why did I ask?
“I wasn’t finished, Sydney,” he says
quietly.
I shake my head and keep facing the
opposite direction while he gets out the
rest of what he wants to say.
“She forgave him for what happened
with you, but what happened with you
was also an eye opener about why they
were even together in the first place. It
turns out she couldn’t find a good enough
reason to take him back. Ridge said
she’s got a lot of life left to live, but she
can’t live it to the fullest when he’s
constantly trying to hold her back.”
I bring both hands to my face,
completely perplexed by my heart now.
Just seconds ago, I was grieving because
she forgave him, and now I’m grieving
because she didn’t.
Just three months ago, I was sitting
outside on my suitcases in the rain,
believing I was experiencing what it felt
like to be heartbroken.
God, I was wrong. So damn wrong.
This is heartbroken.
This.
Right now.
Warren’s arms wrap around me, and
he pulls me to him. I know he doesn’t
want to see me upset, and I’m really
trying my best not to appear that way.
Crying about it won’t help, anyway. It
hasn’t helped for the past six days I’ve
been doing it.
I pull away from Warren and walk to
the counter, where I tear off a paper
towel. I wad it up and wipe my eyes
with it. “I hate feelings,” I say as I
sniffle back more tears.
Warren laughs and nods in agreement.
“Why do you think I chose to be with a
girl who has none?”
The Bridgette diss makes me laugh. I
do my best to suck it up and wipe away
the rest of my tears, because, as I told
myself before, the outcome of Ridge and
Maggie doesn’t matter to my situation.
No matter how things turn out between
them, it still doesn’t mean anything for
Ridge and me. Things are entirely too
complicated between us, and nothing but
space and time can change that.
“I’ll go watch a movie with you,” I
say to Warren. “But it better not be a
porn.”
Ridge
“Give me my damn keys, Ridge,”
Warren signs.
I calmly shake my head for the third
time in five minutes. “I’ll give you the
keys when you tell me where she lives.”
He glares at me hard, still refusing to
budge. I’ve had his keys for most of the
day now, and I’ll be damned if I’ll give
them back before he gives me the
information I need. I know it’s only been
three weeks since Maggie broke up with
me, but I haven’t been able to stop
thinking about how everything I’ve done
to Sydney has affected her. I need to
know if she’s okay. I’ve gone this long
without contacting her simply because
I’m not sure what I’ll say when I
eventually do see her. All I know is that
I need to see her, or I’ll more than likely
never sleep again. It’s been more than
three weeks since the last time I had a
full night’s sleep, and my mind just
needs reassurance.
Warren sits across from me at the
table, and I return my attention to the
computer in front of me. Despite the fact
that I want to blame my entire past few
weeks on computers, I know it was all
my fault, so I sucked it up and bought a
new one. I still have to rely on a
computer for income, unfortunately.
Warren reaches across the table and
slams my laptop shut, forcing me to look
up at him.
“Nothing good will come of it,” he
signs. “It’s only been three weeks since
you and Maggie ended things. I’m not
giving you Sydney’s address, because
you don’t need to see her. Now, give me
my keys, or I’m taking your car.”
I grin smugly. “Good luck finding my
keys. They’re in the same spot I hid
yours.”
He shakes his head in frustration.
“Why are you being such a dick, Ridge?
She’s finally on her own and making a
life for herself and doing well, and you
want to barge in and confuse her all over
again?”
“How do you know she’s doing well?
Do you talk to her?” The desperation in
my question surprises me, because I
didn’t know until this second just how
much I need her to be okay.
“Yeah, I’ve seen her a few times.
Bridgette and I had lunch with her
yesterday.”
I fall back against my chair, slightly
annoyed that he didn’t tell me this but
relieved to know she’s not holed up in
her apartment, devastated.
“Has she asked about me? Does she
know about Maggie and me?”
He nods. “She knows. She asked how
things went with the two of you, so I told
her the truth. She hasn’t brought it up
since then.”
Jesus Christ. Knowing that she knows
the truth should relieve my worry, but it
only intensifies it. I can’t imagine what
she must think about my lack of
communication with her now that she
knows about Maggie. The fact that I
haven’t contacted her at all probably has
her believing I blame her. I lean forward
and look pleadingly to Warren.
“Please, Warren. Tell me where she
lives.”
He shakes his head. “Give me my
keys.”
I shake my head.
He rolls his eyes at our matched
stubbornness and pushes himself away
from the table, then storms off to his
room.
I open my texts to Sydney, and begin
scrolling through them as I do every
single day, wishing I had the courage to
text her. I’m afraid it will be easier for
her to shut me out through a text than it
would be if I were to show up at her
front door, which is why I haven’t texted
her. Despite the fact that I don’t want to
agree with Warren, I know that nothing
good will come from my contacting her.
I know we’re not in a place to start a
relationship, and seeing her in person
would only exacerbate how much I miss
her. However, knowing what I should do
and abiding by what I should do are two
completely different things.
• • •
My light flicks on. Seconds later, my
shoulders are being violently shaken. I
smile through the grogginess, knowing
by Warren’s presence alone that I’ve got
him right where I want him. I turn over
and look up at him.
“Something wrong?” I sign.
“Where are they?”
“Where are what?”
“My condoms, Ridge. Where the hell
did you hide my condoms?”
I knew that if stealing his keys didn’t
work, then stealing his condoms would.
I’m just glad he thought to put on shorts
before leaving Bridgette in his bed and
storming into my room.
“You want your condoms?” I sign.
“Tell me where she lives.”
Warren runs his palms over his face,
and from the looks of it, I think he’s
groaning. “Forget it. I’ll go to the store
and buy new ones.”
Before he turns to walk out of my
room, I sit up on the bed. “How do you
plan on driving to the store? I have your
keys, remember?”
He pauses for a second, and then his
face relaxes when he’s hit with a new
epiphany. “I’ll take Bridgette’s car.”
“Good luck finding her keys.”
Warren stares at me hard for several
seconds, then finally slumps his
shoulders and turns toward my dresser.
He grabs a pen and paper and writes
something down, wads it up, and throws
it at me. “Here’s her address, asshole.
Now, give me my keys.”
I unfold the paper and double-check to
make sure he actually wrote an address
down. I reach behind my nightstand, and
grab his box of condoms, and toss it to
him.
“That should do you for now. I’ll tell
you where your keys are after I confirm
that this is really her address.”
Warren pulls one of the condoms out
of the box and tosses it at me.
“Take this with you when you go,
because that’s definitely her address.”
He turns and leaves the room, and no
sooner is he gone than I’m up and
dressed and heading out the front door.
I don’t even know what time it is.
I don’t even care.
Chapter Twenty Three
Sydney
Sound triggers.
They happen a lot, but mostly when I
hear certain songs. Especially songs
Hunter and I both loved. If I listen to a
song during a particularly depressing
period, then hear it later on down the
road, it brings back all the old feelings
associated with that song. There are
songs I used to love that now I
absolutely refuse to listen to. They
trigger memories and feelings I don’t
want to experience again.
My text tone has become one of those
sound triggers.
Namely, Ridge’s text tone. It’s very
distinct, a snippet from the demo of our
song “Maybe Someday.” I assigned it to
him after I heard the song for the first
time. I’d like to say that sound trigger is
a negative one, but I’m not so sure it is.
The kiss I experienced with him during
the song certainly led to negative
feelings of guilt, but the kiss itself still
turns my heart into a hot mess just
thinking about it. And I think about it a
lot. Way more than I should.
In fact, I’m thinking about it right now
as the snippet of our song pours from the
speakers of my cell phone, indicating
that I’m receiving a text.
From Ridge.
I honestly never expected to hear this
sound again.
I roll over on my bed and stretch my
arm to the nightstand, my now-trembling
fingers grasping at my phone. Knowing
that I’ve received a text from him has
once again wreaked havoc with my
organs, and they’ve forgotten how to
function properly. I pull the phone to my
chest and close my eyes, too nervous to
read his words.
Beat, beat, pause.
Contract, expand.
Inhale, exhale.
I slowly open my eyes and hold up the
phone, then unlock the screen.
Ridge: Are you home?
Am I home?
Why would he care if I were home?
He doesn’t even know where I live.
Besides, he made it pretty clear where
his heart’s loyalty resided when he told
me to move out three weeks ago.
But I am home, and despite my better
judgment, I want him to know I’m home.
I’m tempted to respond with my address
and tell him to come find out for himself
whether or not I’m home.
Instead, I go with something safer.
Something less telling.
Me: Yes.
I pull the covers off and sit up on the
edge of the bed, watching my phone, too
afraid even to blink.
Ridge: You’re not answering the door.
Am I at the wrong apartment?
Oh, God.
I hope he’s at the wrong apartment. Or
maybe I hope he’s at the right apartment.
I can’t really tell, because I’m happy
he’s here, but I’m pissed off that he’s
here.
These conflicting feelings are
exhausting.
I stand and run out of my bedroom,
straight to my front door. I peer through
the peephole, and sure enough, he’s at
my front door.
Me: You’re outside my door, so yeah.
Right apartment.
I look out the peephole again after
hitting send, and he’s standing with his
palm flat against the door, staring at his
phone. Seeing the pained expression on
his face and knowing it derives from the
battle his heart is going through makes
me want to swing open the door and
throw my arms around him. I close my
eyes and press my forehead to the door
in order to give myself time to think
before making any rash decisions. My
heart is being pulled toward him, and I
can’t think of anything I want more right
now than to open this door.
However, I also know that opening
the door won’t do either of us any good.
He just broke up with Maggie a matter of
weeks ago, so if he’s here for me, he can
turn right around and leave. There’s no
way anything could work between us
when I know he’s still heartbroken over
someone else. I deserve more than what
he can give me right now. I’ve been
through too much this year to let
someone screw with my heart like this.
He shouldn’t be here.
Ridge: Can I come in?
I turn until my back is pressed against
the door. I clutch the phone to my chest
and squeeze my eyes shut. I don’t want
to read his words. I don’t want to see his
face. Everything about him makes me
lose sight of what’s important, what’s
best for me. He isn’t what’s best for my
life right now, especially considering
what he’s gone through in his own life,
and I should walk away from this door
and not let him in.
But everything in me wants to let him
in.
“Please, Sydney.”
The words are almost an inaudible
whisper through the other side of the
door, but I definitely heard them. Every
single part of me heard them. The
desperation in his voice, combined with
the simple fact that he spoke, completely
slays me. I allow my heart to make my
decision for me this time as I slowly
face the door. I turn the lock and slide
the latch loose, then open the door.
I can’t describe what it feels like to
see him standing in front of me again
without using the term terrifying.
Everything about the way he makes
me feel is absolutely terrifying. The way
my heart wants to be held by him is
terrifying. The way my knees seem to
forget how to hold me up is terrifying.
The way my mouth wants to be claimed
by his is terrifying.
I do my best to hide what his presence
does to me by turning away from him
and walking toward the living room.
I don’t know why I’m trying to hide
my reaction from him, but isn’t that what
people do? We try so hard to hide
everything we’re really feeling from
those who probably need to know our
true feelings the most. People try to
bottle up their emotions, as if it’s
somehow wrong to have natural
reactions to life.
My natural reaction in this moment is
to turn and hug him, regardless of the
reason he’s here. My arms want to be
around him, my face wants to be pressed
against his chest, my back wants to be
cradled by him—yet I’m standing here
trying to pretend that’s the last thing I
need from him.
Why?
I inhale a calming breath, then turn
around when I hear him close the front
door behind him. I lift my eyes to meet
his, and he’s standing several feet in
front of me, watching me. I can tell by
the tightness in his expression that he’s
doing exactly what I’m doing. He’s
holding back everything he’s feeling for
the sake of . . . what?
Pride?
Fear?
The one thing I’ve always admired
about my relationship with Ridge is that
we’re so honest and real with each
other. I’ve always been able to say
exactly what I was thinking, and so has
he. I don’t like this shift we’ve made.
I try to smile at him, but I’m not sure if
my smile is working right now. I speak
to him and enunciate clearly so he can
read my lips. “Are you here because you
need a flaw?”
He laughs and exhales at the same
time, relieved that I’m not angry.
I’m not angry. I’ve never been mad at
him. The decisions he’s made during the
time he’s known me aren’t decisions I
can hold against him. The only thing I
hold against him is the night he kissed
me and ruined me for every other kiss
I’ll ever experience.
I take a seat on the couch and look up
at him. “Are you okay?” I ask.
He sighs, and I quickly look away. It’s
hard enough being in the same room as
him right now, but even harder to make
eye contact with him. He completes the
walk into the living room and sits on the
couch next to me.
I debated buying more furniture, but
one couch was all I could afford. A love
seat at that. I’m not so sure I’m sad about
my lack of furniture, though, because his
leg is touching my thigh, and the simple
contact causes heat to roll through me
like a riptide. I look down at our knees
when they brush together and realize I’m
still wearing the T-shirt I threw on right
before I went to bed. I guess I was so
shocked by the fact that he said he was at
my apartment door that I didn’t concern
myself with how I looked. I’m in nothing
but an oversized cotton T-shirt that falls
to my knees, and my hair is more than
likely a wreck.
He’s in jeans and a gray Sounds of
Cedar T-shirt. I would say I feel
underdressed, but I’m actually dressed
appropriately for what I was doing
before he showed up, which was going
to bed.
Ridge: I don’t know if I’m okay. Are
you okay?
I forgot I even asked him a question
for a second.
I shrug. I’m sure I will be fine, but I’m
not going to lie and tell him I am. I think
it’s obvious that neither one of us can
really be okay with how everything has
turned out. I’m not okay with losing
Ridge, and Ridge isn’t okay with losing
Maggie.
Me: I’m sorry about Maggie. I feel
awful. She’ll come around, though.
Five years is a lot to give up for a
misunderstanding.
I hit send and finally look up at him.
He reads the text, then eyes me. The
concentration in his expression makes
the breath catch in my lungs.
Ridge: It wasn’t a misunderstanding,
Sydney. She understood a little too
well.
I read his text several times, wishing
he would expand on it. What wasn’t a
misunderstanding? The reason they
broke up? His feelings for me? Rather
than ask him what he means, I cut to the
question I want the answer to the most.
Me: Why are you here?
He works his jaw back and forth
before responding.
Ridge: Do you want me to leave?
I look at him and slowly shake my
head no. Then I pause and shake my head
yes. Then I pause again and just shrug.
He smiles endearingly, completely
understanding my confusion.
Me: I guess whether or not I want you
here depends on why you’re here. Are
you here because you need me to try
to help you win back Maggie? Are you
here because you miss me? Are you
here because you want to try to work
out some sort of friendship?
Ridge: Would I be wrong if I answered
none of the above? I don’t know why
I’m here. Part of me misses you so
much it hurts, while part of me wishes I
never even met you to begin with. I
guess today is one of the days I was
hurting, so I stole Warren’s keys and
forced him to give me your address. I
didn’t think this through or come up
with any kind of speech. I just did what
my heart needed me to do, which was
to see you.
His brutally honest reply melts my
heart and pisses me off all at the same
time.
Me: What about tomorrow? What if
tomorrow is one of the days you
wished you never met me? What am I
supposed to do then?
The intensity in his stare is unnerving.
Maybe he’s trying to gauge if that was an
angry response. I’m not sure if it was or
not. I’m not sure how I feel about the fact
that he doesn’t even know why he’s
here.
He doesn’t respond to my text, and it
proves one thing: he’s having the same
internal conflict with himself that I’ve
been having.
He wants to be with me, but he
doesn’t.
He wants to love me, but he doesn’t
know if he should.
He wants to see me, but he knows he
shouldn’t.
He wants to kiss me, but it would hurt
just as much as it did the first time he
kissed me and had to walk away. I
suddenly feel uncomfortable staring at
him. We’re way too close together on
this couch, yet my body is making it very
clear to me that it doesn’t think we’re
close enough at all. What it’s wishing
would happen right now are all the
things that aren’t.
Ridge looks away and slowly scans
my apartment for a few moments, then
returns his attention to his phone.
Ridge: I like your place. Good
neighborhood. Seems safe.
I almost laugh at his text and the
casual conversation he’s trying to make,
because I know we’re no longer in a
place for casual conversation. We can’t
be friends at this point. We also can’t be
together with so much against us. Casual
conversation has no place between us
right now, yet I can’t bring myself to
reply any differently.
Me: I like it here. Thank you for
helping me out with the hotel until I
could move in.
Ridge: It was the least I could do.
Absolutely the least I could do.
Me: I’ll pay you back as soon as I get
my first paycheck. I got my job back at
the campus library, so it should only
be another week.
Ridge: Sydney, stop. I don’t even want
you to offer.
I have no idea what to say in
response. This whole situation is
awkward and uncomfortable, because
we’re both dancing around all the things
we wish we had the courage to do and
say.
I set my phone facedown on the couch.
I want him to know that I need a break. I
don’t like that we aren’t being us.
He takes the hint and lays his phone
down on the armrest beside him, then
sighs heavily as he drops his head
against the back of the couch. The
silence makes me wish I could
experience the world from his
perspective for once. I find it almost
impossible to put myself in his shoes,
though. People with the advantage of
hearing take so much for granted, and
I’ve never understood that to the extent
that I understand it now. There’s nothing
being spoken between us, yet I
understand by his heavy sigh that he’s
frustrated with himself. I understand how
much he’s holding back by the way his
breaths are being sharply pulled in.
I suppose his expertise in a silent
world gives him an ability to read
people, just in different ways. Instead of
focusing on the sounds of my breaths, he
focuses on the rise and fall of my chest.
Rather than listening to quiet sighs, he
more than likely watches my eyes, my
hands, my posture. Maybe that’s why his
face is tilted toward mine now, because
he wants to see me and get a feel for
what’s going through my head.
I feel as if he reads me too well. The
way he’s watching me forces me to try to
control every facial expression and
every breath. I close my eyes and lean
my head back, knowing he’s staring,
trying to get a sense of where I am.
I also wish I could just turn to him and
tell him. I want to tell him how much
I’ve missed him. I want to tell him how
much he means to me. I want to tell him
how horrible I feel, because before I
showed up in his life, everything seemed
perfect for him. I want to tell him that
even though we both regretted it, that
minute we spent kissing was the one
minute out of my entire life that I
wouldn’t trade for the world.
At moments like these, I’m thankful he
can’t hear me, or there would have been
so many things spoken that I would
regret.
Instead, there are so many things left
unsaid that I wish I had the courage to
say. Ridge’s weight shifts on the couch,
and my eyes naturally open out of
curiosity. He’s leaning across the arm of
the couch, reaching for something. When
he turns back around, he’s holding a pen
in his hand. He smiles softly, then picks
up my arm. He turns his body toward
mine and presses the pen to my open
palm.
I swallow hard and slowly look up at
his face, but he’s looking down at my
hand as he writes. I could swear I almost
see a faint smile flash across his lips.
When he’s finished, he brings my palm
to his mouth and blows softly to dry the
ink. His lips are moist and puckered into
a pout, and holy hell, it just got really
warm in this apartment. He lowers my
hand, and I look down at it.
Just wanted to touch your hand.
I laugh softly. Mostly because his
words are so innocent and sweet
compared to the things he’s written on
me in the past. I’ve been sitting here on
this couch with him for ten minutes,
wishing he would touch me, and then he
goes and admits he was thinking the
exact same thing. It’s so juvenile, as if
we’re teenagers. I’m almost
embarrassed that it pleases me this much
that he’s touching me, but I can’t recall a
time I’ve ever wanted anything more.
He hasn’t released my hand yet, and
I’m still looking down at his writing,
smiling. I brush my thumb across the
back of his hand, and he gasps quietly.
The permission I just gave him with that
tiny movement seems to have broken
some invisible barrier, because he
immediately slides his hand over mine
and presses our palms together, then
intertwines our fingers. The warmth of
his hand doesn’t come close to the
warmth that just shot through my entire
body.
God, if just holding hands with him
feels this intense, I can’t imagine what
everything else with him would feel like.
We’re both watching our hands now,
feeling every bit of the connection
pulsating through our palms. He brushes
over my thumb and flips our hands over,
then takes the pen and presses it to my
wrist. He moves the pen slowly up my
wrist, drawing in a straight line all the
way up my forearm. I don’t stop him. I
simply watch him. When he reaches the
crease in my elbow, he begins to write
again. I read each word as he writes it.
Just an excuse to touch you here,
too. Without releasing my hand, he lifts my
arm and keeps his eyes focused on mine
as he bends forward and blows softly up
and down my arm. He presses his lips
lightly against his words and kisses them
without once breaking eye contact. When
his lips meet my arm, I feel a soft flick
of his tongue tease my arm for a split
second before his mouth closes over my
skin.
That might have just made me
whimper.
Yep. Pretty sure I just whimpered.
God, I’m so glad he couldn’t hear that.
He pulls his lips away from my arm
and continues to watch me, gauging my
reaction. His eyes are dark and piercing,
and they’re focused all over me. On my
lips, on my eyes, on my neck, on my hair,
on my chest. He can’t seem to take me in
fast enough.
He presses the pen against my skin
again, starting where he left off. He rolls
the pen slowly up my arm, watching it
intently the whole time. When he reaches
the sleeve of my T-shirt, he pushes it up
carefully until my shoulder is exposed.
He makes a small mark with the pen,
then slowly leans over me. My head
falls back against the couch when I feel
his lips meet my skin. His breath is close
and warm against my shoulder. I’m not
even thinking about the fact that he’s
drawing all over me. That can be
washed off later. Right now, I just want
his pen to keep going and going until it’s
completely out of ink.
He pulls away and releases my hand,
switching the pen to his other hand. He
pulls my sleeve back down over my
shoulder, then slips his fingers inside the
collar of my T-shirt, tugging it to expose
more of my collarbone. He puts the tip
of the pen on my shoulder and glances up
at me while he proceeds with caution,
making his way to my neck. His
expression is heated, and I can tell he’s
proceeding with caution despite the fact
that I know exactly what he wishes were
happening right now and where he plans
to go with this pen. He doesn’t have to
verbalize it when his eyes clearly state it
for him.
He moves the pen slowly up my neck.
I naturally tilt my head to the side, and as
soon as I do, I hear a rush of air hiss
quietly through his teeth. He comes to a
stop just below my ear. I squeeze my
eyes shut and hope my heart doesn’t
explode when he leans in, because it
definitely feels as if it could. His lips
press gently against my skin, and I swear
the room flips upside down.
Or maybe that was just my heart.
One of my hands slides up his arm and
grasps the back of his head, not wanting
him to pull away from this spot. His
tongue makes another quick appearance
against my neck, but he doesn’t let my
desperation stall him. He lifts away and
looks back down at me. His eyes are
smiling, knowing how crazy he’s driving
me. He rolls the pen from the spot below
my ear, back down my neck, and around
to the dip in the base of my throat.
Before kissing the spot he just marked,
he grabs me by the waist and lifts me up,
sliding me onto his lap.
I grasp his arms and suck in a rush of
air the second he pulls me against him.
My T-shirt slides up my thighs, and the
fact that I’m not wearing anything under
it except underwear pretty much
guarantees that I’ve gotten myself into
something that’s going to be damn hard
to pull away from.
His eyes drop to the base of my throat
as he slides a hand up my thigh, over my
hip, and all the way up and into my hair.
He grasps the back of my head, then
pulls my neck against his mouth. This
kiss is harder and not at all cautious like
the rest of them. I slide my hands into his
hair and keep his mouth pressed against
my neck.
He works his kisses all the way up my
neck until his mouth meets my chin. Our
bodies are meshed firmly together, and
one of his hands has found my lower
back and is keeping me flush against
him.
I can’t move. I’m literally panting for
breath, wondering where in the hell the
strong Sydney went. Where’s the Sydney
who knows this shouldn’t be happening?
I’ll look for her later. After he
finishes with his pen.
He pulls away when his lips come
close to my mouth. Our bodies are as
close as they can get without his mouth
being on mine. He removes his hand
from my lower back and brings the pen
back around to my throat. When he
touches the tip of it to my skin, I gulp,
anticipating which direction he’s about
to go with it.
North or south, north or south. I don’t
really care.
He begins to scroll upward, but then
he stops. He pulls the pen away from my
neck and shakes it, then touches it to my
neck again. He makes another movement
upward with the pen but stops again. He
pulls back slightly and frowns at the pen,
which I’m assuming has just run out of
ink. He looks back at me and tosses the
pen over my shoulder. I hear it land on
the floor behind me.
His eyes drop to my lips, which I’m
assuming would have been the pen’s
final destination. We’re both breathing
heavily, knowing exactly what’s about to
come next. What we’re about to
experience again for the second time,
knowing how much our first kiss
affected us.
I think he’s as terrified as I am right
now.
I’m leaning all my weight into him,
because I’ve never been this weak. I
can’t think, I can’t move, I can’t breathe.
I just . . . need.
He brings both hands to my cheeks
and looks directly into my eyes.
“Your call,” he whispers.
Jesus Christ, that voice.
I stare at him, not sure if I like that he
just put the control in my hands. He
wants this to be my decision.
It’s so much easier having someone
else to blame when things go where they
shouldn’t. I know we shouldn’t be
putting ourselves into a situation we’re
only going to regret once it’s over. I
could put a stop to it right here. I could
make it easier by asking him to leave
now, rather than when things get even
more complicated between us. I could
slide off his lap and tell him he shouldn’t
be here because he hasn’t even had time
to forgive himself for what happened
with Maggie. I could tell him to go away
and not come back until his heart isn’t
confused anymore about who it wants.
If that day ever comes.
There are so many things I could and
should and need to do, but none of them
is what I want to do.
The pressure picks the worst possible
time to break me. The worst possible
time.
I squeeze my eyes shut when I feel a
tear begin to work its way out. It trickles
down my cheek, falling slowly toward
my jaw. It’s the absolutely slowest
descent a tear has ever made. I open my
eyes, and Ridge is watching it. He’s
following the wet trail with his eyes, and
I can see his jaw growing more tense
with every second that passes. I want to
reach up and wipe it away, but the last
thing I want to do is hide it from him. My
tears say a whole lot more about how
I’m feeling right now than I’m willing to
say in a text.
Maybe I need him to know that this is
hurting me.
Maybe I want it to hurt him, too.
When the tear finally curves and
disappears under my jaw, he brings his
eyes back to mine. I’m surprised by what
I see in them.
His own tears.
Knowing that he’s hurting because I’m
hurting shouldn’t make me want to kiss
him, but it absolutely does. He’s here
because he cares about me. He’s here
because he misses me. He’s here
because he needs to feel what we felt in
our first kiss again, just as I do. I’ve
wanted that feeling back since the
second his mouth left mine and he
walked away.
I remove my hands from his shoulders
and grab the back of his head, then lean
into him, bringing my mouth so close to
his that our lips brush.
He grins. “Good call,” he whispers.
He closes the space between our
mouths, and everything else falls away.
The guilt, the worries, the concern over
what happens after this kiss ends. It all
melts away the second his mouth claims
mine. He gently coaxes my lips apart
with his tongue, and all the chaos
running through my heart and head is
eliminated when I feel his warmth inside
my mouth.
Kisses like his should come with a
warning label. They can’t be good for
the heart. He runs a hand around to my
upper thigh, then slips it beneath the hem
of my T-shirt. His hand glides across my
back, and he grips me tightly, then lifts
his hips at the same time as he pulls me
harder against him.
Oh.
My.
Goodness.
I become weaker and weaker with
every rhythmic movement he creates
with our bodies. I find whatever parts of
him I can hold on to, because I feel as if
I’m falling. I grab his shirt and his hair
while I moan softly into his mouth. When
he feels the sound escape my throat, he
quickly pulls away from my mouth and
squeezes his eyes shut, breathing
heavily. When he opens his eyes again,
he’s staring at my throat.
He pulls his hand from beneath my
shirt, then slowly brings it up to my
neck.
Oh, my dear, sweet God.
He wraps his fingers around my neck,
gently pressing his palm into the base of
my throat while he stares at my mouth.
The thought of him wanting to feel what
he’s doing to me makes my head swarm
and the entire room spin. I’m somehow
able to glance into his eyes long enough
to see them transform from a calm desire
to an almost carnal need.
With his other hand still curved
around the back of my head, he pulls me
to him with more urgency, covering my
mouth with his. The second his tongue
finds mine again, I give him more moans
than he can possibly keep up with.
This is exactly what I’ve wanted from
him. I’ve wanted him to show up and tell
me how much he’s missed me. I’ve
needed to know that he cares about me,
that he wants me. I’ve needed to feel his
mouth on mine again so I could know
that the way his first kiss made me feel
wasn’t just in my head this whole time.
Now that I have it, I’m not sure I’m
strong enough for it. I know that the
second this ends and he walks out the
front door, my heart will die all over
again. The more I open up to him, the
more I need him. The more I admit to
myself that I need him, the more it hurts
to know that I still don’t exactly have
him.
I’m still not convinced that he’s here
for the right reasons. Even if he is here
for the right reasons, it’s still wrong
timing. Not to mention all the questions
still running through my head. I try to
push them away, and for brief moments,
it works. When his hands graze my cheek
or his lips close over mine, I forget all
about those questions that I can’t seem to
run away from. But then he’ll pause to
catch his breath, and he’ll look me in the
eye, and all those questions just cram
right back into the front of my head, until
they’re so heavy that they’re forcing
more tears to want to escape.
I clench his arms when the uncertainty
begins to take over. I shake my head and
try to push against him. He pulls away
from my mouth and sees my doubt
building, and he shakes his head to get
me to stop analyzing this moment
between us. His eyes are pleading as he
strokes my cheek, pulls me flush against
him, and tries to kiss me again, but I
struggle out of his arms.
“Ridge, no,” I say. “I can’t.”
I’m still shaking my head when his
hand grips my wrist. I slide off his lap
and keep walking until his fingers fall
away from me.
I walk straight to the kitchen sink and
dispense soap into my hands, then begin
scrubbing the ink off my arm. I reach into
a drawer and pull out a rag, then wet it
and press it to my neck. Tears are
streaming down my cheeks as I try to
wash away the reminders of what just
happened between us. The reminders are
going to make him that much harder to
overcome.
Ridge comes up behind me and places
his hands on my shoulders. He turns me
around to face him. When he sees that
I’m crying, his eyes fill with apology,
and he pulls the rag from my hand. He
brushes the hair off my shoulder and
gently rubs my skin, washing away the
ink. He looks incredibly guilty for
making me cry, but it’s not his fault. It’s
never his fault. It’s no one’s fault. It’s
both our faults.
When he’s finished rubbing away the
ink, he tosses the rag behind me onto the
counter, then pulls me against his chest.
The comfort that surrounds me makes
this even harder. I want this all the time.
I want him all the time. I want these tiny
snippets of perfection between us to be
our constant reality, but that can’t happen
right now. I completely understand his
earlier comment, when he said that there
are times he misses me and times he
wishes he never met me, because right
now, I’m wishing I never set foot out
onto my balcony the first time I heard his
guitar.
If I never experienced how he could
make me feel, then I wouldn’t miss it
after he’s gone.
I wipe my eyes and pull away from
him. There’s so much we need to
discuss, so I walk to the couch, retrieve
our phones, and bring his to him. I move
away from him to lean against the other
counter while I type, but he grabs my
arm and pulls me back. He leans against
the bar and pulls my back against his
chest, then wraps his arms around me
from behind. He kisses the side of my
head, then moves his lips to my ear.
“Stay here,” he says, wanting me to
remain pressed against him.
It’s crazy how being held by someone
for just a few minutes can forever
change how it feels not to be held by
him. The second he releases his hold on
you, it suddenly feels as if a part of you
is missing. I guess he feels it, too, which
is why he wants me near him.
Does he feel this way about Maggie,
too? Questions like this refuse to leave my
mind. Questions like this keep me from
believing he could ever be happy with
the outcome of his situation, because he
lost her in the end. I don’t want to be
someone’s second choice.
I lean my head against his shoulder
and squeeze my eyes shut, trying my best
not to let my mind go there again.
However, I know I have to go there if I
ever want to find a sense of closure.
Ridge: I wish I could read your mind.
Me: Believe me, I wish you could, too.
He laughs quietly and squeezes me
tightly in his arms. He keeps his cheek
pressed against my head as he types out
another text.
Ridge: We’ve always been able to say
whatever is on our minds. You still
have that with me, you know. You can
say whatever you need to say,
Sydney. That’s what I’ve always loved
about us the most.
Why do all the words he says and
writes and texts have to pierce my heart?
I inhale a deep breath, then exhale
carefully. I open my eyes and look down
at my phone, terrified to ask the one
question I don’t really want the answer
to. I ask it anyway, because as much as I
don’t want to know the answer, I need to
know the answer.
Me: If she texted you right now and
said she made the wrong choice,
would you go? Would you walk out my
front door without thinking twice?
My head stills when the rapid rise and
fall of his chest comes to a sudden halt.
I can no longer hear his breaths.
His grip around me loosens slightly.
My heart crumbles.
I don’t need to read an answer from
him. I don’t even need to hear it. I can
feel it in every part of him.
It’s not as if I were expecting his
answer to be any different. He spent five
years with her. It’s obvious that he loves
her. He’s never said otherwise.
I was just hoping he was wrong.
I immediately break away from him
and walk swiftly toward my bedroom. I
want to lock myself inside until he
leaves. I don’t want him to see what this
does to me. I don’t want him to see that I
love him the same way he loves Maggie.
I reach my bedroom and swing open
the door. I rush inside and begin to shut
the door behind me, but he pushes the
door open. He steps into my bedroom
and turns me around to face him.
His eyes are searching mine,
desperately trying to get across whatever
it is he wishes he could say. He opens
his mouth as if he’s going to speak, but
then he closes it again. He releases my
arms, then turns around and runs his
hands through his hair. He grips the back
of his neck, then kicks my bedroom door
shut with a frustrated groan. He leans his
forearm into the door and presses his
forehead against it. I do nothing but stand
still and watch him try to fight the war
within himself. The same war I’ve been
fighting.
He remains in the same position while
he lifts his phone and responds to my
text.
Ridge: That’s not a fair question.
Me: Yeah, well, you didn’t really put
me in a fair situation by showing up
here tonight.
He turns until his back is flat against
my bedroom door. He brings two
frustrated hands to his forehead, then
lifts his leg at the knee and kicks the
door behind him. Seeing him struggle
with who he really wants is more pain
than I’m willing to endure. I deserve
more than he can give me right now, and
his conflict is screwing with my heart.
Screwing with my head. Everything with
him is just too much.
Me: I want you to leave. I can’t be
around you anymore. It terrifies me
that you’re wishing I were her.
He hangs his head and stares at the
floor for several moments while I
continue to stare at him. He isn’t denying
that he’d rather be with Maggie right
now. He isn’t making excuses or telling
me he could love me more than he loves
her. He’s completely quiet . . . because he
knows I’m right.
Me: I need you to leave. Please. And if
you really care about me, you won’t
come back.
He slowly turns and faces me. His
eyes lock with mine, and I’ve never seen
more emotions flash through them than in
this moment.
“No,” he says firmly.
He begins walking toward me, and I
begin backing away from him. He’s
shaking his head pleadingly. He reaches
me just as my legs meet my bed, and then
he grabs my face between his hands and
presses his lips to mine.
I shake my head and push against his
chest. He steps away from me and
winces, looking even more frustrated
with his inability to communicate with
me. His eyes search the room for
whatever will help him convince me I’m
wrong, but I know nothing can help our
situation. He just needs to realize this,
too. He looks down at my bed, then back
at me. He grabs my hand and pulls me
around to the side of the bed. He places
his hands on my shoulders and pushes
me down until I’m seated. I have no idea
what he’s doing, so I don’t resist.
Yet.
He continues to lower me until I’m
lying with my back flat on the bed. He
stands straight up and removes his Tshirt.
Before he even has it completely
over his head, I’m already attempting to
roll off the bed. If he thinks sex will fix
our situation, he’s not as smart as I
thought he was.
“No,” he says again when he sees me
trying to escape.
The sheer conviction in his voice
causes me to freeze, and I fall back
against my mattress again. He kneels
down on the bed, grabs a pillow, and
lays it beside my head. He lies down
next to me, and my whole body tenses
from his close proximity. He picks up
his phone.
Ridge: Listen to me, Sydney.
I stare at the text in anticipation of
what he’ll type next. When I notice that
he’s not even texting me a follow-up, I
look at him. He shakes his head and
pulls my phone from my hands, then
tosses it beside him. He takes my hand
and places it over his heart.
“Here,” he says, patting my hand.
“Listen to me here.”
My chest tightens when I realize what
he wants me to do. He pulls me to him,
and I willingly allow it. He gently
lowers my head to his heart as he adjusts
himself beneath me and helps me get
comfortable.
I relax against his chest, finding the
rhythm of his heartbeat.
Beat, beat, pause.
Beat, beat, pause.
Beat, beat, pause.
It’s absolutely beautiful.
The way it sounds is beautiful.
The way it cares is beautiful.
The way it loves is beautiful.
He presses his lips to the top of my
head.
I close my eyes . . . and I cry.
Ridge
I hold her against me for so long I’m not
even sure if she’s awake. I still have so
much I want to say to her, but I don’t
want to move. I love the way she feels
when we’re wrapped together like this.
I’m afraid if I move, she’ll come to her
senses again and ask me to leave.
It’s barely been three weeks since
Maggie and I broke up. When Sydney
asked if I’d take Maggie back, I didn’t
answer, but only because I know she
wouldn’t believe my answer.
I love Maggie, but I honestly don’t
think Maggie and I are best for each
other anymore. I know exactly where we
went wrong. The beginning of our
relationship was romantic to the point
where it was almost fictionalized. We
were nineteen years old. We barely
knew each other. The way we waited for
an entire year only built up feelings that
weren’t based on anything except false
hopes and idealized love.
By the time Maggie and I were finally
able to be together, I think we were
more in love with the idea of us, rather
than with the actual us. Of course, I
loved her. I still love her. But until I met
Sydney, I had no idea how much my love
for Maggie was built up from my desire
to swoop in and save her.
Maggie was right. I’ve done nothing
for the past five years but try to be the
hero who protects her. The problem?
Heroines don’t need protecting.
When Sydney put me on the spot
earlier, I wanted to tell her no, that I
wouldn’t take Maggie back. When she
said she was terrified that I was wishing
she were Maggie, I wanted to grab hold
of her and prove to her how I’ve never,
not once, wished I were anywhere else
when I’m with her. I wanted to tell her
the only regret I have is not realizing
sooner which one of them I was better
for. Which girl I made more sense with.
Which girl I grew to love in a realistic,
natural way, not in an idealized sense.
I didn’t say anything because I’m
terrified she won’t understand. I’ve
chosen Maggie over her time and time
again, and it’s my own fault that I’ve put
doubt into Sydney’s head. And even
though I know that the scenario she’s
painting could never happen because
Maggie and I both accept that it’s over,
I’m not so sure I wouldn’t take Maggie
back. However, my decision wouldn’t
be because I want to be with Maggie
more. It wouldn’t even be because I love
Maggie more. But how do I possibly
convince Sydney of that when it’s hard
for me to comprehend?
I don’t want Sydney ever to feel like
my second choice, when I know in my
heart that she’s the right choice. The
only choice.
I keep my arm around her, and I pick
up my phone. She lifts her head and rests
her chin on my chest, looking up at me. I
hand her back her phone, and she takes
it, then turns away from me and presses
her ear against my heart again.
Me: Do you want to know why I
needed you to listen to me?
She doesn’t respond with a text. She
just nods her head yes, remaining
pressed against my chest. One of her
hands is slowly tracing up and down
from my waist to my arm. The feel of her
hands against my skin is something I
never want to become a memory. I lower
my left hand to the back of her head and
stroke her hair.
Me: It’s kind of a long explanation. Do
you have a notebook I can write in?
She nods and slides off me. She
reaches into her nightstand and takes out
a notebook and a pen. I readjust myself
against her headboard. She hands me the
notebook but doesn’t move closer to me.
I grab her wrist and part my legs, then
motion for her to lie against me while I
write. She crawls toward me and wraps
her arms around my waist, pressing her
ear to my heart again. I put my arms
around her and prop the notebook on my
knee, resting my cheek on top of her
head.
I wish there was an easier way for us
to communicate so all the things I have
to say to her could be instant. I wish I
could look into her eyes and tell her
exactly how I feel and what’s on my
mind, but I can’t, and I hate that for us.
Instead, I lay my heart out on paper. She
remains still against my chest while I
take almost fifteen minutes to gather my
thoughts and get them all down for her.
When I’m finished, I hand her the
notebook. She readjusts herself until her
back is pressed against my chest. I keep
my arms around her and hold her while
she reads the letter.
Sydney
I have no idea what to expect from the
words he’s just written, but as soon as
he hands me the paper I begin to soak
every sentence up as quickly as my eyes
can scan them. The fact that a barrier
exists in the way we communicate makes
every word I receive from him, in
whatever form, something I feel the need
to consume as quickly as possible.
I don’t know if I’m actually more
aware of my own heartbeat than other
people are of theirs, but I tend to
believe I am. The fact that I can’t hear
the world around me leaves me to focus
more on the world inside me. Brennan
told me the only time he’s aware of his
own heartbeat is when it’s quiet and
he’s being still. That’s not the case for
me, because it’s always quiet in my
world. I’m always aware of my
heartbeat. Always. I know its pattern. I
know its rhythm. I know what makes it
speed up and slow down, and I even
know when to expect that. Sometimes I
feel my heart react before my brain has
the chance to. The reactions of my
heart have always been something I
was able to predict . . . until a few
months ago.
The first night you walked out onto
your balcony was the first night I
noticed the change. It was subtle, but it
was there. Just an extra little skip. I
brushed it off because I didn’t want to
think it had anything to do with you. I
liked how loyal my heart was to
Maggie, and I didn’t want my loyalty to
her to change.
But then, the first time I saw you
singing along to one of my songs, it
happened again. Only that time, it was
more obvious. It would speed up a little
faster every time I saw your lips
moving. It would start beating in places
I never felt my heart beat before. That
first night I saw you singing, I had to
get up and go inside to finish playing,
because I didn’t like how you made my
heart feel. For the first time, I felt as
though I had absolutely no control over
it, and that made me feel horrible.
The first time I walked out of my
bedroom to find you standing in my
apartment, soaking wet from the rain—
my God, I didn’t know hearts could
beat like that. I knew my heart like the
back of my hand, and nothing had ever
made it react like you did. I put the
blankets on the couch for you as
quickly as I could, pointed you in the
direction of the bathroom, and
immediately went back to my bedroom.
I’ll spare you the details of what I had
to do while you were in my shower in
order to calm myself down after seeing
you up close for the first time.
My physical reaction to you didn’t
worry me. Physical reactions are
normal, and at that point, my heart still
belonged to Maggie. My heartbeats
were all for Maggie. They always had
been, but the more time I spent with
you, the more you started to
unintentionally infiltrate and steal
some of those heartbeats. I did
everything I could to prevent it from
happening. For a while, I convinced
myself that I was stronger than my
heart, which is why I allowed you to
stay. I thought what I felt for you was
nothing but attraction and that if I let
myself have you in my fantasies
enough, that would suffice in reality.
However, I soon realized that the way I
fantasized about you wasn’t at all how
guys normally fantasize about girls
they’re attracted to. I didn’t imagine
myself stealing kisses from you when
no one was around. I didn’t imagine
myself sliding into your bed in the
middle of the night and doing to you all
the things we both wished I would do.
Instead, I was imagining what it would
feel like if you fell asleep in my arms. I
was imagining what it would feel like
to wake up next to you in the morning. I
was imagining your smiles and your
laughter and even how good it would
feel to be able to comfort you when you
cried.
The trouble I had gotten myself into
became obvious the night I put those
headphones in your ears and watched
you sing the song we created together.
Watching those words pass your lips
and knowing I couldn’t hear them and
feeling how much my heart ached for us
in that moment, I knew what was
happening was so much more than I
could control. My strength was
overpowered by my weakness for you.
The second my lips touched yours, my
heart split completely in two. Half of it
belonged to you from that point on.
Every other beat of my heart was for
you.
I knew I should have asked you to
leave that night, but I couldn’t bring
myself to do it. The thought of saying
good-bye to you hurt way too much. I
had planned on asking you to move out
the next day, but once we talked
through everything, the ease with
which we dealt with our situation gave
me more excuses to ignore it. Knowing
we were both fighting it gave me hope
that I could give back to Maggie the
part of my heart I had lost to you.
The weekend of Warren’s party was
when I realized it was too late. I spent
the entire night of the party trying not
to watch you. Trying not to be obvious.
Trying to keep my attention focused on
Maggie, where it should have been.
However, all the effort and denial in
the world couldn’t have saved me from
what happened the next day. When I
walked into your room and sat down
beside you on the bed, I felt it.
I felt you give me a piece of your
heart.
And Sydney, I wanted it. I wanted
your heart more than I’ve ever wanted
anything. The second I reached down
and held your hand in mine, it
happened. My heart made its choice,
and it chose you.
My relationship with Maggie was a
great one, and I never want to
disrespect what I had with her. When I
told you I’ve loved her since the
moment I met her and that I’d love her
until the moment I die, I was being
honest. I have always loved her, I do
love her, and I always will love her.
She’s an incredible person who
deserves so much more than what life
has handed her, and it pisses me off to
this day when I think about it. I would
switch my fate with hers in a second if I
had that option. Unfortunately, life
doesn’t work that way. Fate doesn’t
work that way. So even after I knew I
had found in you what I would never
find in my relationship with Maggie, it
still wasn’t enough. No matter how
much I cared for you or how deep my
feelings for you ran, it would have
never been enough to get me to leave
Maggie. If I couldn’t change her fate, I
was at least going to give her the best
damn life I could give her. Even if it
meant sacrificing aspects of my own, I
would have done it without pause, and I
never would have regretted it. Not even
for a second.
However, until three weeks ago, I
didn’t realize that the best life I could
give her was a life without me in it. She
needed the opposite of what I could
offer her, and I know that now. She
knows that now. And we accept it.
So when you ask if I would choose
her over you, you’re presenting a
situation that I can’t give you a
straight answer to. Because yes, at this
point, I probably would walk away
from you if she asked me to. The
majority of my loyalty still lies with
her. But if you’re asking who I need
more? Who I want to be with more?
Who my heart craves more? My heart
decided that for me a long time ago,
Sydney.
When I’ve read the last word, I pull
the notebook against my chest and cry.
He slides me off of him until I’m on my
back, and he hovers over me, guiding my
eyes up to meet his.
“It’s you,” he says aloud. “My heart . .
. wants you.”
A sob breaks free from my chest when
I hear his words. I immediately grab his
shoulders and lift myself up, pressing my
lips to the area directly over his heart. I
kiss him over and over, silently thanking
him for giving me reassurance that I
haven’t been in this alone.
When I lower my head back to the
pillow, he lies beside me, then pulls me
against him. He touches my cheek with
his hand and slowly leans in to kiss me.
His mouth caresses mine so carefully it
feels as if he’s holding my heart in his
hand and is afraid he might drop it.
As much as I’m convinced he would
do everything he could to protect my
heart, I’m still too scared to hand it over.
I don’t want to give it to him until I know
it’s the only heart he’s holding.
• • •
I don’t open my eyes, because I don’t
want him to know I hear him leaving. I
felt him kiss me. I felt him slide his arm
out from beneath me. I heard him pull his
shirt over his head. I heard him search
for a pen. I heard him write me a letter,
and I heard him place it on the pillow
beside me.
I feel his hand as it presses into the
mattress beside my head. His lips meet
my forehead before he pulls away and
walks out my bedroom door. When I
hear the front door shut, I roll onto my
side and pull the covers over my head to
block out the sunlight. If I didn’t have to
work today, I’d stay right here in this
position and cry myself dry.
I brush my hand across the mattress in
search of his letter. When I find it, I pull
it under the covers with me and read it.
Sydney,
A few months ago, we thought we had
it all figured out. I was with the one
girl I thought I would be with forever,
and you were with a guy you thought
deserved you way more than he did.
Look at us now.
Wanting more than anything to be
free to love each other but cursed by
bad timing and loyal hearts. We both
know where we want to be; we just
don’t know how to get there. Or when
we should get there. I wish things were
as easy as they seemed when I was
nineteen. We’d grab a calendar and
pick a date, and we’d start a
countdown until I could show up at
your front door and start loving you.
However, I’ve learned that the heart
can’t be told when and who and how it
should love. The heart does whatever
the hell it wants to do. The only thing
we can control is whether we give our
lives and our minds the chance to catch
up to our hearts.
I know that’s what you want more
than anything. Time to catch up.
As much as I want to stay here and
allow this to begin between us, there’s
something I want from you even more
than that. I want you to be with me in
the end, and I know that can’t happen if
I keep trying to rush our beginning. I
know exactly why you were hesitant to
let me in last night: you aren’t ready
yet. Maybe I’m not, either. You’ve
always said you wanted time to
yourself, and the last thing I want is to
start a relationship with you when I’ve
barely given enough respect to the one
that just ended with Maggie.
I don’t know when you’ll be ready
for me. It might be next month or next
year. Whenever it is, just know that I
have absolutely no doubt that we can
make this work. I know we can. If there
are two people in this world capable of
finding a way to love each other, it’s
us.
Ridge
P.S. I spent most of the night
watching you sleep, so that’s one
fantasy I got to check off the list. I also
wrote lyrics to an entire song, which
was unfortunate for Brennan. I didn’t
have my guitar, so I forced him to make
a rough cut of it at five o’clock this
morning so I could leave it with you.
One of these days, I’ll play it for
you, along with all the other songs I
plan to write for you while we’re apart.
Until then, I’ll be waiting patiently.
Just say when.
I fold the letter and pull it against my
chest. As much as it hurts to know he’s
walking away, I also know that I need to
let him. I asked for this. We need this. I
need this. I need to get myself to a point
where I know that we can finally be
together without all the doubt running
through my head. He’s right. My mind
needs to catch up to my heart.
I run the back of my hand across my
eyes, then open my texts.
Me: Can you come over? I need your
help.
Warren: If this has to do with the fact
that I gave Ridge your address last
night, I’m sorry. He forced it out of me.
Me: This has nothing to do with that. I
need to ask you for a huge favor.
Warren: Be there when I get off work
tonight. Should I bring condoms?
Me: Funny guy.
I close out the text to Warren and open
up the song Ridge just sent me. I reach
into my drawer for my headphones, then
fall back against my pillow and hit play.
IT’S YOU
Baby, everything you’ve ever done
Underneath this here sun
It doesn’t even matter anymore
Oh, of this I’m sure
‘Cause you’ve taken me
Places I want to be
And you show me
Everything that I could ever
Want to see
You, you know it’s
You know it’s you
I think about you every single day
Trying to think of something better
to say
Maybe hi, how are you
Not just anything will do
‘Cause you’ve taken me
Places I want to be
And you show me
Everything that I could ever
Want to see
You, you know it’s
You know it’s you
Chapter Twenty Four
Ridge
Me: I’m looking at your schedule for
March. You’re free on the 18th.
Brennan: Why do I feel like I’m about
to be busy on the 18th?
Me: I’m planning a show, and I need
your help. We’ll do it locally.
Brennan: What kind of show? Full
band?
Me: No, just you and me. Maybe
Warren if he’ll sign for us.
Brennan: Why do I feel like this has to
do with Sydney?
Me: Why do I feel like I don’t care
what you feel like?
Brennan: The ball is in her court,
Ridge. You really should just leave
things alone until she’s ready. I know
how you feel about her, and I don’t
want you to screw it up.
Me: March 18 is still three months
away. If she hasn’t made up her mind
by that date, then all I’m doing is giving
her a little shove. And when did you
start giving relationship advice? How
long has it been since you were in
one? Oh, wait. That would be never.
Brennan: If I agree to help you, will
you STFU? What do you need me to
do?
Me: Just carve out some time for me
between now and then to run through
some new songs.
Brennan: Is someone over his writer’s
block?
Me: Yeah, well, someone once told me
heartache is good for lyrical
inspiration. Unfortunately, he was
right.
Brennan: Sounds like a smart guy.
I close out my texts to Brennan and
open one up to Warren.
Me: March 18. I need a local venue. A
small one. Then I need you to get
Sydney to go there with you that night.
Warren: Is she supposed to know you
orchestrated this?
Me: No. Lie to her.
Warren: Not a problem. I’m good at
lying.
I set my phone down, pick up my
guitar, and walk out onto my balcony.
It’s been almost a month since I last saw
her. Neither of us has texted the other. I
know Warren still keeps in contact with
her, but he refuses to tell me anything, so
I just stopped asking. As much as I miss
her and as much as I want to beg her to
just let this begin with us, I know time is
better for both of us right now. There
was still too much guilt rolled up in the
thought of starting something too soon,
despite how much we wanted to be
together. Waiting until we’re both in a
good place is definitely what needs to
happen.
However, I feel as if I’m already
there. Maybe it’s easier for me because I
know where Maggie and I stand, and I
know where my heart stands, but Sydney
doesn’t have that reassurance. If time
will give her that reassurance, then I’ll
give her time. Just not too much. March
18 is only three months away. I hope to
hell she’s ready by then, because I’m not
sure I can keep myself away from her for
longer than that.
I scoot my chair to the edge of the
balcony and fold my arms over the
railing, then look over at her old
balcony. Every time I come out here and
see her empty chair, it makes all of this
so much harder. But I can’t seem to find
anything inside my apartment that
reminds me of her anymore. She left
nothing when she moved, and she really
never had anything while she was here.
Being outside on this balcony is the
closest I can come to feeling her since it
seems we’re so far apart.
I lean back in my chair, pick up a pen,
and begin writing the lyrics to another
song, with nothing but her on my mind.
The cool air running through my
hair
Nights like these, doesn’t seem
fair
For you and I to be so far away
The stars all shimmer like a
melody
Like they’re playing for you and
me
But only I can hear their sounds.
I pick up my guitar and work through the
first few chords. I want these songs to be
enough to convince her that we’re ready,
so every single thing has to be perfect.
I’m just nervous that I’m relying too
much on Warren to help make it happen.
I hope he’s more reliable in this
situation with Sydney than he is with his
rent checks.
Chapter Twenty Five
Sydney
“I’m not going.”
“Yes, you are,” Warren says, kicking
my legs off the coffee table. “I’m bored
out of my mind. Bridgette works all
weekend, and Ridge is off doing God
knows what with God knows who.”
I immediately look up at him with my
heart caught in my throat.
He laughs. “That got your attention.”
He reaches forward, grabs my hands,
and pulls me off the couch. “I’m kidding.
Ridge is at home working, being a
mopey little shit, just like you’re trying
to be. Now, go get pretty and come out
with me tonight, or I’ll sit on the couch
with you and force you to watch porn.”
I pull my hands from his and walk to
the kitchen. I open a cabinet, then grab a
cup. “I don’t want to go out tonight,
Warren. I had class all day, and it’s my
only night off from the library. I’m sure
you can find someone else to go with
you.” I grab a container of juice from the
refrigerator and fill my glass. Leaning
against the counter, I take a sip as I
watch Warren pout in my living room.
He’s kind of adorable when he pouts,
which is why I always give him such a
hard time.
“Listen up, Syd,” he says, walking
toward the kitchen. He grabs a bar stool
and pulls it out, then takes a seat. “I’m
about to lay things out for you, okay?”
I roll my eyes. “I doubt I can stop you,
so go ahead.”
He lays his palms flat on the counter
in front of him and leans forward. “You
suck.”
I laugh. “That’s it? That’s what you
needed to lay out for me?”
He nods. “You suck. So does Ridge.
Since the night I gave him your address,
you’ve both sucked. All he does is work
or write music. He doesn’t even play
pranks on me anymore. Every time I’m
over here, you’re just focused on
studying. You never want to go out. You
never want to hear my sex stories
anymore.”
“Correction,” I say, interrupting him.
“I’ve never wanted to hear your sex
stories. That’s nothing new.”
“Whatever,” he says, shaking his
head. “My point is that the two of you
are miserable. I know you need time and
blah, blah, blah, but that doesn’t mean
you have to give up fun while you’re
figuring your life out. I want to go have
fun. No one wants to have fun with me
anymore, and that’s all your fault,
because you’re the only one who can put
a stop to the misery you and Ridge are
going through. So, yes. You suck. You
suck, you suck, you suck. And if you
want to stop sucking so much, then go get
dressed so we can go out and not suck
together for just a few hours.”
I don’t know how to argue with that. I
do suck. I suck, I suck, I suck. Only
Warren could put it in such a simple,
straightforward way that would actually
make sense. I know I’ve been miserable
the past few months, and it doesn’t help
to know that Ridge has been miserable,
too. He’s miserable because he’s sitting
around waiting for me to get over
whatever it is that’s keeping me from
contacting him.
The last thing he said in his letter to
me was Just say when.
I’ve been trying to say when since the
moment I read that letter, but I’m just too
scared. I’ve never felt about anyone or
anything the way I feel about him, and
the thought of our not working out is
enough to keep me from saying that one
little word. I feel as if the longer we
wait and the more time we have to heal,
the better chance we’ll have at our
maybe someday.
I keep waiting for the moment when I
know for sure that he’s moved on from
Maggie. I keep waiting for the moment
when I know for sure that he’s ready to
commit fully to me. I keep waiting for
the moment when I know for sure that
I’m not going to be consumed with guilt
for allowing myself to trust someone
with my heart again.
I don’t know when I’ll get to that
point, and it hurts to know that my
inability to move forward is holding
Ridge back.
“Now,” Warren says, shoving me out
of the kitchen. “Get dressed.”
• • •
I can’t believe I’ve let him talk me into
this. I check my makeup one last time
and grab my purse. As soon as he sees
me, he shakes his head. I huff and throw
my hands in the air.
“What now?” I sigh. “I’m not dressed
appropriately?”
“You look great, but I want you to
wear the blue dress.”
“I burned that dress, remember?” I
say.
“The hell you did,” he says, pushing
me back toward my bedroom. “You
were wearing it last week when I
stopped by. Go put it on so we can
leave.”
I spin around to face him. “I know
how much you like that dress, and
wearing it tonight while I’m out with you
is a little too creepy, Warren.”
He narrows his eyes. “Listen, Syd. I
don’t mean to be rude, but all this
moping around for the past few months
has caused you to put on a little weight.
Your ass looks huge in those jeans. The
blue dress may be able to hide a little of
that, so go put it on, or I might be too
embarrassed to go out with you.”
I suddenly feel like slapping him
again, but I know he’s just got a peculiar
sense of humor. I also know he might
have a completely different reason for
why he wants me to wear this dress and
I’m trying not to let myself think it has
anything to do with Ridge, but pretty
much every situation I’m in somehow
makes me think about Ridge. It’s nothing
new. But Warren is a guy who seems to
put his foot in his mouth a lot, and I’m a
girl, so I still wonder if his sarcastic
remark has any truth to it. I have been
replacing the void Ridge left in my life
with food. I look down at my stomach
and pat it, then look back up at Warren.
“You’re an asshole.”
He nods. “I know.”
The innocent smile on his face makes
me instantly forgive any crudeness
behind his joke. I change into the blue
dress, but I am so cock-blocking him
tonight. Jerk.
• • •
“Wow. This is . . . different,” I say,
taking in my surroundings. It’s nothing
like the clubs Warren usually likes to go
to. This one is a lot smaller, without
even much of a dance floor. There’s an
empty stage along one wall, but there’s
no one performing tonight. The jukebox
is playing, and several people are
scattered around at tables, talking quietly
among themselves. Warren chooses a
table toward the middle of the room.
“You’re a cheap date,” I say. “You
didn’t even feed me.”
He laughs. “I’ll buy you a burger on
the way home.”
Warren pulls out his phone and begins
texting someone, so I look around for a
while. It’s kind of cozy. It’s also kind of
weird that Warren brought me here. But
I’m thinking he doesn’t have any evil
intentions, because he’s not even paying
attention to me.
His attention is on his phone, and he
keeps glancing at the door. I don’t
understand why he wanted to come out
tonight, and I especially don’t
understand why he chose this place.
“You’re actually the one who sucks,”
I say. “Stop ignoring me.”
He responds without even looking up
at me. “You aren’t talking, so
technically, I’m not ignoring you.”
I’m curious now. He’s not being
himself, the way he’s so distracted.
“What’s up with you, Warren?”
As soon as I ask the question, he looks
up from his phone and smiles over my
shoulder, then stands. “You’re late,” he
says to someone behind me. I look to see
Bridgette walking toward us.
“Screw you, Warren,” she says to him
with a small smile. He wraps his arms
around her, and they kiss for several
uncomfortable seconds. I reach up and
tap him on the arm when I’m convinced
that neither of them can breathe. He pulls
away from Bridgette, winks at her, and
slides out his chair for her.
“I have to go to the bathroom,” he
says to Bridgette. He points at me.
“Don’t go anywhere.”
He says it as if it’s a command, and it
irritates me even more because he’s
being really rude tonight. I turn and face
Bridgette once he’s left the table.
“Warren said you were working all
weekend,” I say.
She shrugs. “Yeah, well, he probably
told you that because of the elaborate
scheme he has planned for tonight. He
made me come so you wouldn’t leave
when you found out about it. Oh, and I’m
not supposed to tell you any of that, so if
he comes back, play dumb.”
My heart rate escalates. “Please tell
me you’re kidding.”
She shakes her head and raises her
arm in the air, calling over a waiter. “I
wish I was kidding. I had to switch shifts
to be here, and now I have to work a
double tomorrow.”
I drop my head into my hands,
regretting the fact that I let Warren talk
me into anything. Just when I’m reaching
for my purse to leave, he walks out onto
the empty stage.
“Oh, God,” I groan. “What the hell is
he doing?” My stomach is in knots. I
have no idea what he has planned, but
whatever it is, it can’t be good.
He taps on the microphone, then
adjusts the height of it. “I’d like to thank
everyone for coming tonight. Not that
any of you are here for this particular
event, since it’s a surprise, but I feel the
need to thank you anyway.”
He adjusts the microphone once more,
then finds our table in the crowd and
waves. “I want to apologize to you, Syd,
because I feel really bad for lying to
you. You haven’t gained weight, and
your ass looked great in those jeans, but
you really needed to wear that dress
tonight. Also, you don’t suck. I lied
about that, too.”
Several people in the crowd laugh,
but I just groan and bury my face in my
hands, peeking through my fingers at him
up on the stage.
“All right, let’s get on with it, shall
we? We have a few new songs for you
tonight. Unfortunately, the whole band
couldn’t be here, because”—he looks to
his left at the small width of the stage,
then to his right—“well, I don’t think
they all could have fit. So I’d like to
present to you a small portion of the
band Sounds of Cedar.”
My heart falls to the floor. I close my
eyes when the crowd begins to clap.
Please, let it be Ridge.
Please, don’t let it be Ridge.
Jesus, when will this confusion go
away?
I can hear commotion up on the stage,
and I’m too scared to open my eyes. I
want to see him sitting up there so much
it hurts.
“Hey, Syd,” Warren says into the
microphone. I inhale a slow, calming
breath, then open my eyes and hesitantly
look up at him. “Remember a few
months ago when I told you sometimes
we have to have really bad days in order
to keep the good ones in perspective?”
I think I nod. I can’t really feel my
body anymore.
“Well, this is one of the good days.
This is one of the really good days.” He
raises his hand in the air and motions to
my table. “Somebody get that girl a shot
of whatever will help loosen her up.”
He moves the microphone to the stool
next to him, and my eyes are glued to the
empty chairs. Someone lays a shot on the
table in front of me, and I instantly grab
it and down it. I drop the shot glass back
onto the table and look up just in time to
see them walk onto the stage. Brennan is
first, and Ridge is right behind him,
carrying a guitar.
Oh, my God. He looks incredible. It’s
the first time I’ve ever seen him on a
stage. I’ve been wanting to watch him
perform since the first moment I heard
his guitar on my balcony and here I am,
about to watch my fantasy become
reality.
He looks the same as he did the last
time I saw him, just . . . incredible. I
guess he looked incredible back then,
too. I just didn’t feel right allowing
myself to admit it when I knew he wasn’t
mine. I must feel okay about it now,
because holy crap. He’s beautiful. He
carries himself with such confidence and
I can definitely see why. His arms look
as if they were built for the sole purpose
of carrying a guitar. It molds to him so
naturally, it’s as if it’s an extension of
him. There isn’t a shadow of guilt
clouding his eyes like there always was
in the past. He’s smiling, like he’s
excited for what’s about to happen. His
enigmatic smile lights up his face and his
face lights up the entire room. At least it
seems that way to me. He glances over
the audience several times as he makes
his way toward his seat, but he doesn’t
immediately spot me.
He takes a seat on the center stool,
and Brennan sits to the left of him,
Warren to his right. He signs to Warren,
and Warren points at me. Ridge looks
out into the audience and finds me. My
hands are clamped over my mouth, and
my elbows are propped up on the table.
He smiles and gives me a nod and my
heart crashes to the floor. I can’t smile
or wave or nod back at him. I’m too
nervous to move.
Brennan leans forward and speaks
into the microphone. “We’ve got a few
new songs—”
His voice is cut off when Ridge pulls
the microphone away from him and leans
in toward it. “Sydney,” Ridge says into
the microphone, “some of these songs I
wrote with you. Some of these songs I
wrote for you.”
I can hear a small difference in the
way he speaks now. I’ve never heard
him say so much at once out loud. He
also seems to enunciate a little more
clearly than the few times he’s spoken to
me in the past, like the subject in the
photograph is slightly more in focus. It’s
obvious he’s been working on it, and
knowing he’s continued to talk out loud
makes my eyes tear up without even
having heard a song yet.
“If you aren’t ready to say the word,
that’s fine,” he says. “I’ll wait as long as
you need me to. I just hope you don’t
mind this interruption tonight.” He
pushes the microphone away, then looks
down to his guitar. Brennan leans into
the microphone and looks at me.
“He can’t hear what I’m saying right
now, so I’ll take this opportunity to tell
you Ridge is full of shit. He doesn’t
want to wait anymore. He wants you to
say the word more than he wants air. So
please, for the sake of all that is holy,
say the word tonight.”
I laugh as I wipe a tear from my eye.
Ridge plays the opening chords to
“Trouble,” and I finally realize why
Warren made me wear this dress.
Brennan leans forward and begins to
sing, and I remain completely immobile
as Warren signs every word to the song
while Ridge keeps his focus on the
fingers strumming his guitar. Watching
the three of them together, seeing the
beauty they can create from a few words
and guitars, is mesmerizing.
Ridge
When the song ends, I look up at her.
She’s crying, but those tears are
accompanied by a smile, and that’s
exactly what I was hoping I would see
when I looked up from my guitar. Seeing
her for the first time since I kissed her
good-bye has a far greater effect on me
than I thought it would. I’m trying my
damndest to remember what it is I’m
here to do, but all I want to do is toss my
guitar aside, rush to her, and kiss her
crazy.
Instead, I keep my eyes trained on
hers while I play another song she
helped me write. I begin the opening
chords to “Maybe Someday.” She smiles
and clutches a hand to her chest while
she watches me play.
It’s times like these I’m actually
thankful I can’t hear. Not being
distracted by anything at all allows me
to focus on nothing but her. I can feel the
music vibrating in my chest as I watch
her lips singing along to the lyrics until
the very last line.
I planned on playing a few more songs
we wrote together, but seeing her has
changed my mind. I want to get to the
new songs I wrote for her, because I
absolutely need to see her reaction to
them. I start one of them, knowing
Warren and Brennan will have no
problem falling into step with the
change-up. Her eyes glisten when she
realizes that this is a song she’s never
heard before, and she leans forward in
her chair, focusing intently on the three
of us.
Sydney
There are only twenty-six letters in the
English alphabet. You would think there
would only be so much you could do
with twenty-six letters. You would think
there were only so many ways those
letters could make you feel when mixed
up and shoved together to make words.
However, there are infinite ways
those twenty-six letters can make a
person feel, and this song is living proof.
I’ll never understand how a few simple
words strung together can change a
person, but this song, these words, are
completely changing me. I feel like my
maybe someday just became my right
now.
HOLD ON TO YOU
The cool air running through my
hair
Nights like these, doesn’t seem
fair
For you and I to be so far away
The stars all shimmer like a
melody
Like they’re playing for you and
me
But only I can hear their sound
Maybe if I ask them they will play
for you
I try wishing on one, maybe I’ll try
two
It doesn’t look like there’s much
for me to do
I want to hold on to you
Just like these memories I can’t
undo
I want to hold on to you
Without you here that’s kind of
hard to do
I want to hold
I want to hold on to you
The front seat’s empty, and I know
When it’s just me I seem to go
To places I never wanted to
I need you here to be a light
Star in the sky brighten up my
night
Sometimes I need the dark to see
So come on, come on, turn it on
for me
Just a little light, and I’ll be able
to see
Promise like a comet you won’t fly
by me
I want to hold on to you
Just like these memories I can’t
undo
I want to hold on to you
Without you here that’s kind of
hard to do
I want to hold
I want to hold on to you
Ridge
I finish the song and don’t give myself
time to look up at her before I begin
playing another one. I’m afraid if I look
at her, I’ll lose every bit of willpower
still keeping me up on this stage. I want
to go to her so bad, but I know how
important it is for her to hear this next
song. I also don’t want to be the one to
make the final choice. If she’s ready to
be with me, she knows what I need from
her. If she’s not ready, I’ll respect her
decision.
However, if she’s not ready to begin
the life I know we could have together
by the end of this song, I don’t know if
she’ll ever be ready.
I keep my eyes trained on my fingers
as they work the strings of the guitar. I
glance at Brennan, and he leans forward
into the microphone, his voice starting
on cue. I glance to Warren, and he
begins signing the words.
I slowly scan the crowd and find her
again.
Our eyes lock.
I don’t look away.
Sydney
“Wow,” Bridgette whispers. Her eyes
are glued to the stage just like mine. Just
like every other pair of eyes in the room.
The three of them make one hell of a
team, but knowing that these words are
Ridge’s words and he wrote them
specifically for me leaves me feeling
more than overwhelmed. I can’t look
away from him. For the entire length of
the song, I barely move. I barely breathe.
LET IT BEGIN
Time went fast
Time went fast till it was gone
You think it’s right
You think it’s right until it’s
wrong
Even after all this time
I still want you
Even after all my mind
Put me through
So won’t you
Won’t you let it begin
So won’t you
Won’t you let it begin
You hold it out
You hold your heart out in your
hand
I snatch it up
I snatch it up fast as I can
Even after all this time
I still want you
Even after all my mind
Put me through
I stand here at your door
Until you come and let me in
I want to be your end
But you gotta let it begin
So won’t you
Won’t you let it begin
So won’t you
Won’t you just say when
Ridge
Our gazes never deviate from each other.
Throughout the song, her focus remains
solely on mine and mine on hers. When
the song ends, I don’t move. I wait for
her mind and her life to catch up to her
heart, and I hope it happens soon.
Tonight. Right now.
She wipes tears from her eyes, then
lifts her hands. She holds up her left
index finger, brings her right index finger
close to the left and circles it around,
and then the tips of her fingers touch.
I can’t move.
She just signed for me.
She just said “when.”
Seeing her sign is something I never
expected. It’s something I never would
have even asked her to do. Learning how
to communicate with me the whole time
we’ve been apart is the most amazing
thing anyone has ever done for me.
I’m shaking my head, unable to get it
through my mind that this girl is
willingly mine and she’s perfect and
beautiful and good and, holy shit, I love
her so much.
She’s smiling, but I’m still frozen in
shock.
She laughs at my response and signs
the word again, several times. “When,
when, when.”
Brennan shoves my shoulder, and I
look over at him. He laughs. “Go,” he
signs, nodding his head in Sydney’s
direction. “Go get your girl.”
I immediately drop my guitar to the
floor and rush off the stage. She pushes
away from her table as soon as she sees
me making my way toward her. She’s
only a few feet away, but I can’t get to
her fast enough. I take in the dress she
has on and make a mental note to thank
Warren later. I have a feeling he had
something to do with that.
I look into her tear-filled eyes when I
finally reach her. She’s smiling up at me,
and for the first time since the moment I
met her, we’re looking at each other
without a trace of guilt or worry or
regret or shame.
She throws her arms around my neck,
and I pull her to me and bury my face in
her hair. I hold her head firmly against
me and close my eyes. We hold on to
each other as if we’re afraid to let go.
I can feel her crying, so I put enough
space between us so I can look into her
eyes. She lifts her head, and I’ve never
seen tears look more beautiful.
“You signed,” I say out loud.
She smiles. “You spoke. A lot.”
“I’m not very good at it,” I admit. I
know my words are hard to understand,
and I still feel uncomfortable when I
speak, but I love seeing her eyes when
she hears my voice. It makes me want to
speak every single word I possibly can
right here and now.
“I’m not good, either,” she says. She
pulls away from me and lifts her hands
to sign. “Warren has been helping me. I
only know about two hundred words, but
I’m learning.”
It’s been several months since I last
saw her, and while I’ve been trying to
believe she still wanted to be with me, I
did have my doubts. I was starting to
question our decision to wait before
starting our relationship. What I never
expected was for her to spend those
months learning how to communicate
with me in a way my own parents didn’t
even care enough to learn.
“I just fell completely in love with
you,” I say to her. I glance at Bridgette,
who is still seated at the table. “Did you
see it, Bridgette? Did you see me just
fall in love with her?”
Bridgette rolls her eyes, and I feel
Sydney laugh. I look back down at her.
“I did. Like twenty seconds ago. I fell
completely in love with you.”
She smiles and mouths her next words
slowly so I can understand her. “I fell
first.”
When the last word passes her lips, I
catch it with my mouth. Since the second
I walked away from these lips, I’ve done
nothing but think about the moment I
would get to taste them again. She pulls
me tightly against her, and I kiss her
hard, then delicately, then fast and slow
and every way in between. I kiss her
every way I can possibly kiss her,
because I plan on loving her every way I
can possibly love her. Every single time
we refused to cave in to our feelings in
the past makes this kiss completely
worth the sacrifices. This kiss is worth
all the tears, all the heartache, all the
pain, all the struggles, all the waiting.
She’s worth it all.
She’s worth more.
Sydney
We make it to my apartment somehow
between all the kissing. He releases me
long enough to let me unlock the door,
but he loses his patience as soon as it’s
unlocked. I laugh when he shoves the
door open and pushes me inside. He
closes the door, locks it, and turns
around to face me again. We look at
each other for several seconds.
“Hi,” he says simply.
I laugh. “Hi.”
He looks around the room nervously
before his eyes fall back to mine. “Is that
good enough?” he asks.
I cock my head, because I don’t really
understand his question. “Is what good
enough?”
He grins. “I was hoping that was
enough talk for tonight.”
Oh.
I get his question now.
I nod slowly, and he smiles, then steps
forward and kisses me. He bends
slightly and lifts me by the waist,
wrapping my legs around him. He
secures his arms around my back and
begins walking me toward my bedroom.
As many times as I’ve seen this
happen in movies and read about it in
books, I’ve never actually been picked
up and carried by a man before. I think
I’m in love with it. Being carried into a
bedroom by Ridge is quite possibly my
new favorite thing out of any and all
things.
That is, until he kicks my bedroom
door shut behind him. Maybe Ridge
kicking doors shut is my new favorite
thing.
He gently lowers me to the bed, and
even though I’m sad that he’s not
carrying me anymore, I’m a little bit
happier to find myself beneath him.
Every single move he makes is better
and sexier than the last one. He pauses
for a moment as he hovers over me, and
his eyes roam sensually over my entire
body, until they come to a pause on the
hem of my dress. He reaches down and
pushes it up, and I lift myself up off the
bed just enough for him to pull it over
my head.
He sucks in a breath when he looks
down at me and sees that the only thing
coming between him and a completely
naked me is a very thin layer of panty.
He begins to lower himself on top of me,
but I push on his chest and shake my
head, tugging on his shirt to let him know
it’s his turn. He grins and quickly pulls
his shirt over his head, then leans in
toward me again. I push against him
once more, and he reluctantly lifts
himself up, shooting me a look of
amused annoyance. I point to his jeans,
and he backs away from the bed, and in
two swift movements, the rest of his
clothes are somewhere on my bedroom
floor. I don’t quite catch where he tossed
them, because my eyes are sort of
preoccupied.
He makes his way on top of me again,
and I don’t stop him this time. I welcome
him by wrapping my legs around his
waist and my arms around his back and
guiding his mouth back to mine.
We mold and fit together so perfectly
it’s as if we were made for this sole
purpose. His left hand fits perfectly into
mine as he brings my arm above my head
and presses it into the mattress. His
tongue melds perfectly with mine as he
continues to tease my entire mouth as if
it were made for this very purpose. His
right hand seamlessly conforms to my
outer thigh as he digs his fingers into my
skin and shifts his weight perfectly
against me.
His mouth leaves mine long enough to
taste my jaw . . . my neck . . . my
shoulder.
I don’t know how being consumed by
him could lend clarity to my purpose in
life, but it absolutely feels that way.
Everything about me and him and life
makes so much more sense when we’re
together like this. He makes me feel
more beautiful. More important. More
loved. More needed. I feel more
everything, and with every second that
passes, I become more and more greedy,
wanting all of every single part of him.
I push against his chest, needing space
between us so I can sign to him. He
looks down at my hands when he
realizes what I’m doing. I hope I get it
right, because I’ve practiced signing this
sentence no fewer than a thousand times
since I last saw him.
“I have something I need to say before
we do this.”
He pulls back a few inches, watching
my hands, waiting.
I sign the words “I love you.”
His eyebrows draw apart, and relief
floods his eyes. He lowers his mouth to
my hands and kisses them, over and
over, then quickly pulls farther away,
unwrapping my legs from around his
waist. Just when I begin to fear he’s
come to some absurd notion that we
need to stop, he lowers himself to my
side but leans over me and presses his
ear against my chest.
“I want to feel you say it.”
I press my lips into his hair, then
lightly secure him against me. “I love
you, Ridge,” I whisper.
His grip tightens around my waist, so
I continue repeating it several times.
I keep his head pressed against my
chest with both hands. He releases his
grip on my waist and trails his hand over
my stomach, causing my muscles to
clench beneath his touch. He continues
stroking his hand in sensuous circles
over my stomach. I stop repeating the
words and focus on where his hand is
traveling, but he stops abruptly.
“I don’t feel you saying it,” he says.
“I love you,” I quickly repeat. When
the words leave my lips, his fingers
begin moving again. As soon as I’m
quiet, his fingers stop.
It doesn’t take me long to figure out
what game he’s playing. I grin and say it
again.
“I love you.”
His fingers slip inside the top edge of
my panties, and my voice grows quiet
again. It’s really hard for me to speak
when his hand is that close. It’s really
hard to do anything. His fingers come to
a pause just inside my panties when he
doesn’t feel me talking. I want his hand
to keep moving, so I somehow breathe
the words.
“I love you.”
His hand slides further inside and
stops. I close my eyes and say it again.
Slowly.
“I . . . love . . . you.”
What he does next with his hand
causes me to repeat the words again
instantly.
And again.
And again.
And again.
And again and again and again, until
my panties are somewhere on the floor,
and I’ve said the words so many times
and so fast that I’m almost screaming
them now. He continues to prove with
the expertise of his hand that he’s quite
possibly the absolute best listener I’ve
ever encountered.
“I love you,” I whisper one last time
between faltered and shallow breaths.
I’m too weak to utter the words again,
and my hands fall away from his head
and land against the mattress with a thud.
He lifts his head away from my chest
and scoots upward until his face is so
close to mine our noses brush. “I love
you, too,” he says with a smug grin.
I smile, but my smile fades when he
rolls away from me, leaving me alone on
the bed. I’m too exhausted and spent to
reach out for him. However, he returns
to the bed as quickly as he left it. He
tears open a condom wrapper and keeps
his eyes focused on mine, never once
looking away.
The way he’s looking at me, as if I’m
the only thing that matters in his world,
makes the moment take on a whole new
feel. I’m completely consumed, not by
waves of pleasure but by waves of raw
emotion. I didn’t know I could feel
someone this much. I didn’t know I
could need someone this much. I had no
idea I was capable of sharing this kind
of connection with someone.
Ridge lifts a hand and wipes away a
tear from my temple, then dips his head
and kisses me, gentle and soft, coaxing
even more tears out of me. It’s the
perfect kiss for the perfect moment. I
know he feels what I’m feeling, because
my tears don’t alarm him at all. He
knows they’re not tears of regret or
sadness. They’re simply tears.
Emotional tears stemming from an
emotional moment that I never imagined
could be this incredible.
He’s waiting patiently for my
permission, so I nod softly, and it’s all
the confirmation he needs. He lowers his
cheek to mine and slowly begins to ease
himself against me. I squeeze my eyes
shut and focus on trying to relax, but my
entire body is way too tense.
I’ve only ever had sex with one guy,
and he didn’t mean half as much to me as
Ridge does. The thought of sharing this
experience with Ridge, as much as I
want to, makes me so nervous I’m
physically unable to hide my discomfort.
He can sense my apprehension, so he
pauses and stills himself above me. I
love how in tune he is with me already.
He looks down at me, his dark brown
eyes searching mine. He takes both of
my hands and pulls them over my head,
then laces our fingers together and
presses them into the mattress. He leans
into my ear. “Want me to stop?”
I quickly shake my head no.
He laughs softly. “Then you have to
relax, Syd.”
I bite my bottom lip and nod,
completely loving the fact that he just
said “Syd” out loud. He runs his nose
down my jaw-line, then brings his lips
close to mine. Every touch sends waves
of heat coursing through me, but it
doesn’t ease my apprehension.
Everything about this moment is so
perfect I’m afraid I might do something
to mess it up. It can’t get any better, so
that only leaves things with one direction
to go.
“Are you nervous?” he asks. His
voice brushes across my mouth, and I
slide my tongue over my bottom lip,
convinced that I could taste his words if
I tried.
I nod, and his eyes soften with his
smile.
“Me, too,” he whispers. He squeezes
my hands tighter and then lays his head
across my bare chest. I can feel the
rhythm of his body rise and fall against
mine with every tense breath. His entire
body sighs, and one by one, each muscle
begins to relax. His hands are still, and
he’s not exploring my body or listening
to me sing or having me tell him I love
him. He’s still, because he’s listening to
me. He’s listening to the beat of my heart.
His head lifts off my chest in one
swift motion as he locks eyes with mine.
Whatever realization he’s just had
causes his gaze to pierce mine with
excitement.
“Do you have earplugs?” he says.
Earplugs?
I know the confusion can be seen in
my expression. I nod anyway and point
to the nightstand. He leans over me,
opens the drawer, and feels around
inside. When he finds them, he lowers
himself beside me again, then places
them in the palm of my hand. He motions
for me to put them in my ears.
“Why?”
He smiles and kisses me, then trails
his lips to my ear. “I want you to hear
me love you.”
I look down at the earplugs, then back
up at him questioningly. “How can I hear
you if I’m wearing these?”
He shakes his head, then places his
hands over my ears. “Not here,” he says.
He moves a hand to my chest. “I want
you to hear me from right here.”
That’s all the explanation I need. I
quickly put the earplugs in, then adjust
my head on my pillow. All the noise
around me slowly fades away. I wasn’t
aware of all the sounds I was taking in
until they no longer run through my head.
I don’t hear the clock ticking anymore. I
no longer hear the usual activity outside
my window. I can’t hear the sheets
moving beneath us or the pillow under
my head or the bed when he shifts his
weight.
I hear nothing.
He grabs my hand and opens up my
palm, then turns my hand around and
places it over my heart. Once my palm is
flush against my heart, he reaches to my
face and brushes his hand over my eyes,
closing them. He scoots himself away
from me until he’s no longer touching
any part of me.
He becomes still, and I no longer feel
him moving next to me.
It’s quiet.
It’s dark.
I hear absolutely nothing. I’m not sure
this is working out the way he imagined.
I hear nothing but complete silence. I
hear what Ridge hears every moment of
his life. The only thing I’m aware of is
my own heartbeat and nothing else.
Nothing at all.
Wait.
My heartbeat.
I open my eyes and look at him. He’s
several inches away from me on the bed,
smiling. He knows I hear it. He smiles
softly, then pulls my hand away from my
heart and places it against his chest.
Tears begin to well in my eyes. I have
no idea how or if I even deserve him,
but there’s one thing I know for sure. As
long as he’s a part of it, I’ll never live a
life of mediocrity. My life with Ridge
will be nothing short of remarkable.
He rolls on top of me and lowers his
cheek to mine, holding completely still
for several long seconds.
I can’t hear his breaths, but I feel them
as they fall against my neck.
I can’t hear his movements, but I feel
him when he begins making the softest,
most subtle shifts against me.
Our hands are still locked between us,
so I focus on the beat of his heart,
drumming against my palm.
Beat, beat, pause.
Beat, beat, pause.
Beat, beat, pause.
I can feel my entire body relaxing
beneath him while he continues to make
the subtlest of movements against me. He
presses his hips into mine for two
seconds, then relaxes and pulls back for
a brief second before repeating the
motion. He repeats this movement
several times, and I can feel my need for
him growing with each rhythmic
movement against me.
The more my desire builds, the more
impatient I become. I want to feel his
mouth on mine. I want to feel his hands
all over me. I want to feel him push
inside me and make me his completely.
The more I think about what I want
from him, the more responsive I become
to the subtle shifts of his weight against
me. The more responsive I become, the
faster our hearts race against the palms
of our hands.
Beat, beat, pause.
Beatbeat, pause.
Beatbeat pause.
Beatbeat pause.
The faster our hearts race, the quicker
his rhythm becomes, matching each beat
of my heart movement for movement.
I gasp.
He’s moving to the sound of my heart.
I wrap my free arm around his neck
and focus on his heartbeat, instantly
aware that our hearts are perfectly in
sync. I tighten my legs around his waist
and lift myself against him, wanting him
to make my heart beat even faster. He
skims his lips across my cheek until
they’re flush against my mouth, but he
doesn’t kiss me. The silence around me
makes me even more aware of the
pattern of his breath falling against my
skin. I focus on my palm against his
chest and feel his quick intake of air,
seconds before I taste the sweetness of
his breath as he exhales, teasing my
mouth.
Inhale, exhale.
Inhale, exhale.
Inhale, exhale.
His rhythmic breathing becomes
quicker when his tongue slips inside my
mouth, gently caressing the tip of mine.
If I could hear, I’m positive I would
have just heard myself whimper. It’s
becoming a habit whenever he’s around.
I move my hand to the back of his
head, needing to taste more of him. I pull
him to me with such sudden urgency he
moans into my mouth. Feeling his moan
without hearing it is probably the most
sensual thing I’ve ever experienced. His
voice as it passes through me does more
than hearing it ever could.
Ridge slides his hand away from my
heart and presses his forearms into the
mattress on both sides of my head. He
boxes me in with his arms, and I slide
my hand away from his chest, needing to
grab hold of him with all my strength.
What little I have left, anyway.
I feel him pull farther back, and then,
without hesitation, he pushes inside me,
claiming me, filling me.
I . . .
Can’t . . .
My heart.
Christ. He just silenced my heart,
because I can no longer feel it at all. The
only thing I feel is him moving against
me . . . away from me . . . inside of me . .
. into me. I’m completely consumed by
him.
I keep my eyes closed and listen to
him without hearing a thing,
experiencing him silently, the same way
he’s experiencing me. I soak in every
single beautiful thing about the
smoothness of his skin and the feel of his
breath and the taste of our moans, until
it’s impossible to tell us apart.
We continue to explore each other
quietly, finding all the parts of ourselves
we’ve only been able to imagine up to
this point.
When my body begins to tense again,
it’s not at all because I’m nervous this
time. I can sense his muscles clenching
beneath my hands, and I grip his
shoulders, ready to fall with him. He
presses his cheek firmly to mine, and I
feel him groan against my neck, making
two final, long thrusts at the same second
as I feel the moans escaping my throat.
He begins to tremble with his release
but somehow pulls his hand between us
again and presses it against my heart.
He’s shaking against me, and I’m doing
my best to regain control of my own
shudders while he begins to slow
himself down, once again to the rhythm
of my heart.
His movements grow so soft and
subtle I can barely feel them through all
the tears I’m crying. I don’t even know
why I’m crying, because this is by far the
most indescribable feeling that has ever
come over me.
Maybe that’s why I’m crying.
Ridge relaxes on top of me and brings
his mouth back to mine. He kisses me so
softly and for so long my tears
eventually subside and are replaced with
complete silence, accompanied only by
the rhythm of our hearts.
Ridge
I close the bathroom door and return to
her on the bed. Her face is illuminated
by the moonlight pouring through the
windows. Her mouth is curled up into a
soft smile as I lower myself down
beside her. I slide my arm beneath her
shoulders, then lay my head on her chest
and close my eyes.
I love the sound of her.
I love her. Everything about her. I
love that she’s never judged me. I love
that she understands me. I love that
despite everything I’ve put her heart
through, she’s done nothing but support
my decisions, no matter how much they
destroyed her at the time. I love her
honesty. I love her selflessness. Most of
all, I love that I’m the one who gets to
love all these things about her.
“I love you,” I feel her say.
I close my eyes and listen as she
continues to repeat the phrase again and
again. I adjust my ear until it’s directly
over her heart, savoring every single
thing about her. Her smell, her touch, her
voice, her love.
I’ve never felt so much at once.
I’ve never needed to feel more.
I lift my head and look back down into
her eyes.
She’s a part of me now.
I’m a part of her.
I kiss her softly on the nose and mouth
and chin, then press my ear against her
heart again. For the first time in my life,
I hear absolutely everything.
