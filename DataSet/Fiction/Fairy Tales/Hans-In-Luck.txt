HANS IN LUCK
HANS HAD SERVED his master seven years, and at the end of the
seventh year he said, “Master, my time is up; I want to go home
and see my mother, so give me my wages.” “You have served me
truly and faithfully,” said the master; “as the service is, so must the
wages be,” and he gave him a lump of gold as big as his head.
Hans pulled his handkerchief out of his pocket and tied up the
lump of gold in it, hoisted it on his shoulder, and set off on his way
home. And as he was trudging along, there came in sight a man
riding on a spirited horse, and looking very gay and lively. “Oh!”
cried Hans aloud, “how splendid riding must be! Sitting as much
at one’s ease as in an arm-chair, stumbling over no stones, saving
one’s shoes, and getting on one hardly knows how!” The horseman
heard Hans say this, and called out to him, “Well Hans, what are
you doing on foot?” “I can’t help myself,” said Hans, “I have this
great lump to carry; to be sure, it is gold, but then I can’t hold my
head straight for it, and it hurts my shoulder.” “I’ll tell you what,”
said the horseman, “we will change; I will give you my horse, and
you shall give me your lump of gold.” “With all my heart,” said
Hans; “but I warn you, you will find it heavy.” And the horseman
got down, took the gold, and, helping Hans up, he gave the reins
into his hand.

“When you want to go fast,” said he, “you must click your tongue
and cry ‘Geeup!’”And Hans, as he sat upon his horse, was glad at
heart, and rode off with merry cheer. After a while he thought he
should like to go quicker, so he began to click with his tongue and
to cry “Gee-up!” And the horse began to trot, and Hans was
thrown before he knew what was going to happen, and there he
lay in the ditch by the side of the road. The horse would have got
away but that he was caught by a peasant who was passing that
way and driving a cow before him. And Hans pulled himself
together and got upon his feet, feeling very vexed. “Poor work,
riding,” said he, “especially on a jade like this, who starts off and
throws you before you know where you are, going near to break
your neck; never shall I try that game again; now, your cow is
something worth having, one can jog on comfortably after her and
have her milk, butter, and cheese every day, into the bargain.
What would I not give to have such a cow!” “Well now,” said the
peasant, “since it will be doing you such a favor, I don’t mind
exchanging my cow for your horse.” Hans agreed most joyfully,
and the peasant, swinging himself into the saddle, was soon out of
sight.
And Hans went along driving his cow quietly before him, and
thinking all the while the fine bargain he had made.
“With only a piece of bread I shall have everything I can possibly
want, for I shall always be able to have butter and cheese to it, and
if I am thirsty I have nothing to do but to milk my cow; and what
more is there for heart to wish!”
And when he came to an inn he made a halt, and in the joy of his
heart ate up all the food he had brought with him, dinner and
supper and all, and bought half a glass of beer with his last two
pennies. Then on he went again driving his cow, until he should
come to the village where his mother lived. It was now near the
middle of the day, and the sun grew hotter and hotter, and Hans
found himself on a heath which it would be an hour’s journey to
cross. And he began to feel very hot, and so thirsty that his tongue
clove to the roof of his mouth.
“Never mind,” said Hans; “I can find a remedy. I will milk my cow
at once.” And tying her to a dry tree, and taking off his leather cap
to serve for a pail, he began to milk, but not a drop came. And as
he set to work rather awkwardly, the impatient beast gave him
such a kick on the head with his hind foot that he fell to the
ground, and for some time could not think where he was; when
3
luckily there came by a butcher who was wheeling along a young
pig in a wheelbarrow.
“Here’s a fine piece of work!” cried he, helping poor Hans on his
legs again.
Then Hans related to him all that had happened; and the butcher
handed him his pocket flask, saying, “Here, take a drink, and be a
man again; of course the cow would give no milk; she is old and
only fit to draw burdens, or to be slaughtered.” “Well, to be sure,”
said Hans, scratching his head. “Who would have thought it? Of
course it is a very handy way of getting meat when a man has a
beast of his own to kill; but for my part I do not care much about
cow beef, it is rather tasteless. Now, if I had but a young pig, that is
much better meat, and then the sausages!”
“Look here, Hans,” said the butcher, “just for love of you I will
exchange, and will give you my pig instead of your cow.” “Heaven
reward such kindness!” cried Hans, and handing over the cow,
received in exchange the pig, who was turned out of his
wheelbarrow and was to be led by a string.
So on went Hans, thinking how everything turned out according to
his wishes, and how, if trouble overtook him, all was sure to be set
right directly. After a while he fell in with a peasant, who was
carrying a fine white goose under his arm. They bid each other
good-day, and Hans began to tell about his luck, and how he had
made so many good exchanges. And the peasant told how he was
taking the goose to a christening feast.
“Just feel how heavy it is,” said he, taking it up by the wings; “it
has been fattening for the last eight weeks; and when it is roasted,
won’t the fat run down!” “Yes, indeed,” said Hans, weighing it in
his hand, “very fine to be sure; but my pig is not to be despised.”
Upon which the peasant glanced cautiously on all sides, and shook
his head.
“I am afraid,” said he, “that there is something not quite right
about your pig. In the village I have just left one had actually been
stolen from the bailiff’s yard. I fear- I fear you have it in your hand;
they have sent after the thief, and it would be a bad look-out for
you if it were found upon you; the least that could happen would
be to be thrown into a dark hole.” Poor Hans grew pale with fright.
“For heaven’s sake,” said he, “help me out of this scrape; I am a
stranger in these parts; take my pig and give me your goose.” “It
will be running some risk,” answered the man, “but I will do it
sooner than that you should come to grief.” And so, taking the cord
4
in his hand, he drove the pig quickly along a by-path, and lucky
Hans went on his way home with the goose under his arm. “The
more I think of it,” said he to himself, “the better the bargain
seems; first I get the roast goose, then the fat; that will last a whole
year for bread and dripping; and lastly the beautiful white feathers
which I can stuff my pillow with; how comfortably I shall sleep
upon it, and how pleased my mother will be!” And when he
reached the last village, he saw a knife-grinder with his barrow;
and his wheel went whirring round, and he sang, “My scissors I
grind, and my wheel I turn; And all good fellows my trade should
learn, For all that I meet with just serves my turn.” And Hans stood
and looked at him; and at last he spoke to him and said, “You seem
very well off, and merry with your grinding.” “Yes,” answered the
knife-grinder, “my handiwork pays very well. I call a man a good
grinder who every time he puts his hand in his pocket finds money
there. But where did you buy that fine goose?” “I did not buy it,
but I exchanged it for my pig,” said Hans. “And the pig?” “That I
exchanged for a cow.” “And the cow?” “That I exchanged for a
horse.” “And the horse?” “I gave for the horse a lump of gold as
big as my head.” “And the gold?” “Oh, that was my wage for
seven years’ service.” “You seem to have fended for yourself very
well,” said the knife-grinder.
“Now, if you could but manage to have money in your pocket
every time you put your hand in, your fortune is made.” “How
shall I manage that?” said Hans.
“You must be a knife-grinder like me,” said the man. “All you
want is a grindstone, the rest comes of itself. I have one here; to be
sure it is a little damaged, but I don’t mind letting you have it in
exchange for your goose; what say you?” “How can you ask?”
answered Hans. “I shall be the luckiest fellow in the world, for if I
find money whenever I put my hand in my pocket, there is nothing
more left to want.” And so he handed over the goose to the peddler
and received the grindstone in exchange.
“Now,” said the knife-grinder, taking up a heavy common stone
that lay near him, “here is another proper sort of stone that will
stand a good deal of wear and that you can hammer out your old
nails upon. Take it with you, and carry it carefully.” Hans lifted up
the stone and carried it off with a contented mind. “I must have
been born under a lucky star!” cried he, while his eyes sparkled for
joy. “I have only to wish for a thing and it is mine.”
After a while he began to feel rather tired, as indeed he had been
on his legs since daybreak; he also began to feel rather hungry, as
5
in the fullness of his joy at getting the cow, he had eaten up all he
had. At last he could scarcely go on at all, and had to make a halt
every moment, for the stones weighed him down most
unmercifully, and he could not help wishing that he did not feel
obliged to drag them along. And on he went at a snail’s pace until
he came to a well; then he thought he would rest and take a drink
of the fresh water. And he placed the stones carefully by his side at
the edge of the well; then he sat down, and as he stooped to drink,
he happened to give the stones a little push, and they both fell into
the water with a splash. And then Hans, having watched them
disappear, jumped for joy, and thanked his stars that he had been
so lucky as to get rid of the stones that had weighed upon him so
long without any effort of his own.
“I really think,” cried he, “I am the luckiest man under the sun.” So
on he went, void of care, until he reached his mother’s house.
THE END
